"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you are interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We know the product is worth less to Alice and we have a better alternative with John for $15,000. We should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price ($11,000 vs. $14,000). This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our maximum budget and John's offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By countering with $11,000, we're aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($12,000).  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** We expect Alice to counter our offer. This initial counteroffer leaves space for further negotiation and compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to counter with an offer of $13,000 for the product. This is my best offer considering its value to both of us. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to our desired price range, $13,000 is still above our target.  We have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're proposing a price directly in between her current offer ($13,000) and our previous counteroffer ($11,000). This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal a willingness to compromise.
* **Reaching Alice's Value:**  We know Alice values the product at $12,000. By offering this price, we're giving her a chance to still make a profit while getting closer to our ideal outcome. 
* **Time Consideration:** While we could continue negotiating in smaller increments, we're getting close to a price where it might make sense to accept. Offering $12,000 could lead to a quick and favorable resolution."
