"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you place on the product. ",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, given the value you've acknowledged the product holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a significant increase from your initial offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm not yet willing to accept $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's worth considering.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
