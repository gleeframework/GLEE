Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers a safety net at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob allows for greater profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  Offering it at $1,300,000 leaves him with a potential $200,000 gain, making it attractive.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting higher than John's offer allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, prompting Bob to decide quickly."
