"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than the $15,000 John is asking, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $10,000, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'll need to charge a bit more than that. How about $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. While $11,500 is a better deal than John's offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob can leverage this to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $11,500 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. How about $11,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $11,750 is very close to his counteroffer of $11,000.  It's also a significantly better deal than what John is offering at $15,000.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's likely that further negotiation will only result in small price adjustments.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product to another buyer."
