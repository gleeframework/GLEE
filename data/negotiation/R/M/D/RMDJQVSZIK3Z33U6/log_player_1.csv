Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think it's a great deal and I'm hoping you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while staying above your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing your potential profit.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best price from Bob and securing a sale."
