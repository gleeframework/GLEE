"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make a reasonable offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth continuing negotiations to see if a lower price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and your desired selling price. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value of the product and your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still above his desired price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get closer to $1,250,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to get a reasonable price for the product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer a price of $1,320,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is the lowest yet, it's still above Bob's desired price. Bob is getting close to his limit, but there's still potential for Alice to lower the price further.  There are still enough rounds left to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,320,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $1,280,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,280,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to offer a price of $1,300,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's closer than before.  There are still a few rounds left, and it's worth attempting to negotiate further to see if Bob can get a lower price.  If Alice won't budge, then Bob can always purchase from John in the final round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to offer $1,290,000. This is a fair compromise that will allow us to close the deal and avoid any further back-and-forth.  "", ""product_price"": 1290000}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations with Alice.  While Alice's offer is the lowest yet, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rather than risk another round of negotiation and potentially getting a worse offer, it's more beneficial for Bob to purchase from John at his set price of $1,200,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids any further risk."
