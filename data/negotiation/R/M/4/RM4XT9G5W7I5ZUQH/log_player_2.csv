"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is higher than that. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $1,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. I'm aiming to reach a price that's closer to my own valuation of the product while leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my valuation, it's still above my ideal price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, especially since I know I can secure the product for $8,000 from John if I need to.  By rejecting the offer, I can try to get Alice closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm now offering Alice's minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's likely she'll accept it to avoid risking losing the deal."
