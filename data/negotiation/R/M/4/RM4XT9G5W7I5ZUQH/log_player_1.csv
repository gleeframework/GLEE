"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to start high, aiming for a profit.  $9,000 is a fair starting point, leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to come down a bit, but I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. It's still a fair profit for me and it's closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum price, which is also the same as John's offer. This is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
