Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I value the product at no less than $120, I'll make an offer that's slightly higher than that.

{""product_price"": $130}

This is my initial offer to Bob. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $110. Since I value the product at no less than $120, I'm not willing to accept his offer. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my minimum value.

{""product_price"": $115}

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's the counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $115}

I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer or make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum value of $120."
