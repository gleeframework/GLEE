"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $13,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but gives me some room to negotiate. It also signals that I'm confident in the product's value.  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, so anything above that is a win for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my goal by counter-offering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $12,500.  This is still above Bob's perceived value, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for potential negotiation.  It also shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob has already rejected two offers, and his counteroffers are steadily decreasing. It's clear that he's not willing to meet my minimum price.  I'm not going to risk losing out on the guaranteed $12,000 from John by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
