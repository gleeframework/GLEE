"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $160. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $150, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's close this deal.",150.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by coming down to $160. I'm willing to meet you at $155, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
