"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. Considering the significant value this product brings to your business, I'm willing to come down a bit further. I'd propose a price of $1,100,000. This price reflects the value we both see in this product while remaining fair for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
