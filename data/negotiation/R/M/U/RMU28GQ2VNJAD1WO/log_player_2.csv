# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $90. I believe it's highly valuable and you'll be very satisfied with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no need to spend $90."
