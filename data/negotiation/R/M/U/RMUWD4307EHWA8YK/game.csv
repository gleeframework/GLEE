"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for the value this product brings.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit higher than my budget.  How about $95?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is a good compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $102. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",102.0,Alice,5,
