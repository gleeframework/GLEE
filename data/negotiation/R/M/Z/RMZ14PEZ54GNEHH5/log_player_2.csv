"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to adjusting the price based on your feedback. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high.  It's better to reject and see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This represents a significant discount and shows my serious interest in making this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer, but still above Bob's maximum price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price takes into account your budget and the product's value. I believe it's a fair price for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, the risk of going over budget or failing to reach a deal is too high.  Buying from John guarantees the product at the desired price and avoids further negotiation."
