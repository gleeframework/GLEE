"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit to make this work for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You can get the same product from John for a lower price of $12,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
