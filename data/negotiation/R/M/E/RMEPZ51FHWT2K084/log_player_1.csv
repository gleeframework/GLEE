{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and still gives me a profit margin. I will adjust my price based on Bob's response and my assessment of his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than what I initially wanted, it's significantly higher than what I would get from John, and it seems like we're nearing a compromise."
