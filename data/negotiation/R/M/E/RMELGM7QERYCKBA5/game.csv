"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,000 is significantly below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,000? This price is fair considering the value you'll receive from the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is closer, but I still need to be at least at $14,500 to make this worthwhile.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that.  Let's split the difference.  How about $14,000?  That's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.  We're getting close, and I believe this price works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,7,
