"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your expertise, and I wouldn't let it go for anything less than $950,000.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. However, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I can only go up to $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product has incredible potential, and I'm confident in its value. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your confidence in the product's potential, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $780,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $780,000 is still less than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $840,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of this product.",840000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $840,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm going to counter with $810,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",810000.0,Bob,6,
