Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,020,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,020,000, which is close to your counteroffer of $1,000,000. It's a fair price and a good deal for you considering your maximum budget is $1,200,000. You're saving $180,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a good chance that further negotiation won't get you a significantly lower price, so it's better to accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal."
