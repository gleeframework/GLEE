"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to potentially capture a larger share of the potential value Bob sees in the product. If he's truly interested, he might be willing to negotiate down from this price. If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can push him to come up with a higher price.  I'm also keeping in mind that John is a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, so I'm not desperate to close with Bob at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still trying to get closer to my desired price point.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is appealing to Bob, while also keeping in mind that I have the backup option of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm only four rounds in, and John is still a viable option at $1,500,000. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000.  I'm lowering my price slightly, showing flexibility.  However, I'm still above my minimum and  hope that this offer is enticing enough for Bob to accept, especially given the risk of losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to sell to John. We've been negotiating for a few rounds, and while Bob has shown interest, we haven't gotten to a price that I'm happy with.  John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is above my minimum and a more secure option than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
