Alice is coming down, but we're still quite a bit away from our target price and John's offer. Let's keep negotiating."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $120. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll offer you $130. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $130. It's time to cut our losses and take John's offer for $120, which meets our budget."
