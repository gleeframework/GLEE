"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows for right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a revised offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,150,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,125,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
