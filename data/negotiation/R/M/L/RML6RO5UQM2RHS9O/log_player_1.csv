Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $950000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $900000.  I believe this product has a lot of potential, but I need to make sure the price aligns with my budget.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $900000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
