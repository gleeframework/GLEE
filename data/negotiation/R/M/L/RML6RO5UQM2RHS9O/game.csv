"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $950000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $950000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $900000.  I believe this product has a lot of potential, but I need to make sure the price aligns with my budget.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer, and I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high.  $925000 is closer to my target, but I'm only able to offer $910000 right now.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to look at other options.",910000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach your target, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $910000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $915000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that this is a fair price considering the product's value. If not, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1000000.",915000.0,Alice,5,
