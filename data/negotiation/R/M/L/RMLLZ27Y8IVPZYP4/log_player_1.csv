Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you first. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves him with a potential ""deal"" since he's getting it for less than my guaranteed sale price. 
* **First Refusal Incentive:** Offering it to Bob first at this price might make him more inclined to accept, knowing he's getting a better price than someone else."
