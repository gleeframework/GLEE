"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers substantial value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly.  Would you consider $1,450,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,450,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer to the mark, but I'm still seeking a figure that accurately reflects the value of this product. How about we settle at $1,375,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end and ensures you acquire a truly valuable asset.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,375,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
