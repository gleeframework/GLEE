# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you based on your needs and interests. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This offer takes into account both the worth of the product to me and its significance to you. I look forward to hearing your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than the price you'd pay John ($15,000).  This means you save $3,000 by accepting Alice's offer. Even though it's above the product's value to Alice, it's still a good deal for you."
