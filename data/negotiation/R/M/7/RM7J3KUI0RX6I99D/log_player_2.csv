"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description] that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm asking for $10000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $9500. This product is truly unique and offers significant value. How about we split the difference at $9250? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is to save money:** While $9,250 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  There's still room to negotiate a lower price. Bob can try to make another counteroffer closer to his initial offer.
* **Potential for better deal:**  It's possible Alice might be willing to come down further, or Bob might be able to find a better deal with John in the future."
