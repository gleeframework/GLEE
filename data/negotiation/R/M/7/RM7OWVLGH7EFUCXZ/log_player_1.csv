Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. This information is incredibly valuable in negotiating a higher price.
* **High Initial Offer (Anchoring):** Starting with a price of $19,000 significantly higher than Bob's perceived value sets a strong anchor.  Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be more favorable to you. 
* **Justification:** The message doesn't explicitly mention Bob's valuation but hints at the product's high value to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives you leverage. You are not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can then decide whether to negotiate further or accept your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower initial offer. However, remember, your goal is to maximize your profit."
