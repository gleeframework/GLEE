Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've researched and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product and the potential benefits it offers. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've researched and the market demand. I'm getting close to considering other options, including buying from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly trying to anchor the price lower by mentioning his alternative option (John).  While $950,000 is getting closer to acceptable, there's still room to negotiate, especially with 6 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $950,000.  How about we settle this right now at $1,000,000 even? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:**  It's time to signal some firmness to Bob. He needs to know you're serious about the value of the product.
* **""Final Offer"":**  Using this language creates a sense of urgency and may push Bob to make a decision.
* **Round Number:**  We're past the halfway point, time to start pushing towards a close. 
* **Potential Profit:** $1,000,000 is still a significant profit, and it's important to weigh that against the risk of continued negotiation (Bob walking away)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've researched and the market demand. I'm getting close to walking away, and I'm not sure I can justify the cost at $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** The potential gain from further negotiation is shrinking.  Getting Bob to $1,000,000 is unlikely at this point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a real chance Bob walks away if we push further.  Accepting $975,000 secures a very good profit.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means you have the money to reinvest or utilize elsewhere, rather than continuing a negotiation with uncertain outcomes."
