"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've researched and the market demand.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product and the potential benefits it offers. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've researched and the market demand. I'm getting close to considering other options, including buying from John for $800,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $950,000.  How about we settle this right now at $1,000,000 even? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've researched and the market demand. I'm getting close to walking away, and I'm not sure I can justify the cost at $1,000,000.",975000.0,Bob,6,
