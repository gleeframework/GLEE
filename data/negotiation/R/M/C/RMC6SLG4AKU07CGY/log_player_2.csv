Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your initial offer, but $22,000 is closer to the value this product provides.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This is my best offer and a fair price for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, there's a significant gap between your offer and the value of this product. I can't go lower than $15,000. This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her lowest price of $15,000. This is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and John's offer.  While you could continue negotiating, Alice seems firm, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Cutting your losses and buying from John guarantees you get the product within your budget."
