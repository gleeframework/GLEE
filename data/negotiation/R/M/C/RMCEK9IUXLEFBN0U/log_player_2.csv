Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $108, which is a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $108 is within your budget of $120 and is a good compromise.  It's likely you won't be able to get a lower price, so accepting her offer is the best strategy to secure the product at a good price."
