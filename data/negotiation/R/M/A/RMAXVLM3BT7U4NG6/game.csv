"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $1,000,000. I believe this aligns more closely with what I am willing to invest at this time.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective. I've done extensive research on this product and its potential, and I believe its true value is significantly higher than your current offer reflects. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is a substantial investment on my part, but I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial outcome.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
