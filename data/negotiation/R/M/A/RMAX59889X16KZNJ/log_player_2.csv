"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product that's worth at least $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round. I think the product is worth more than $10,000 to me, so I'd like to make a counteroffer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about $9,500? That's a good compromise and leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.
