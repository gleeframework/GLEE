"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $13000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12250? This would allow me to make a profit while still offering you a fair price. Let me know what you think.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12250 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11750. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to that.",11750.0,Bob,4,
