Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum.** This leaves room for negotiation and gives you a chance to potentially earn more.
* **It's a clear and concise message.**  It directly states the price and highlights the potential benefits for Bob.

**Important Note:** I'm an AI, so I can't actually ""negotiate"" like a human would. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and the information you get about his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you want to get for the product. You have a chance to potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  You could counteroffer at a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, giving him some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $90, and we can call it a day? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is still below your ideal price, it's very close to your minimum and it avoids the risk of losing a sale to John.  Since Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, it's likely he won't be willing to pay significantly more, so accepting his offer is the best option to ensure a sale."
