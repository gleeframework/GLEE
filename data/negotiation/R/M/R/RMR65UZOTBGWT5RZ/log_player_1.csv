{""product_price"": 140}

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will find this price attractive given his valuation of $150."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $130. While it's above my minimum of $120, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $135. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to accept, as it's still above my minimum and closer to his desired price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

Bob has come back to the same offer of $130.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, it's still a good deal for me and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer. I'm going to accept his offer."
