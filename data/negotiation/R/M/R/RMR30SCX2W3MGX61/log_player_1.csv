Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification for price:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product helps justify the high price tag without revealing specifics. 
* **Exclusivity:**  Positioning the offer as ""exclusive"" adds perceived value and might make Bob more inclined to accept quickly.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in your offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's worth.

**Important:** This strategy aims to maximize profit but acknowledges the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be left with the product."
