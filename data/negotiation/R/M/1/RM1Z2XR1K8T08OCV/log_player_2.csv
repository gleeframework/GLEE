# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product is worth considerably more to me based on its broader potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings.
