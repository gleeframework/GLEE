"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to your ideal outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer serves to gauge Bob's interest level and negotiation strategy. His response will give you valuable information for the subsequent rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind, you have the fallback option of John at $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, leaving no room for negotiation upward.  While accepting would close the deal, you can likely secure a better price by countering, especially since you have the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product is worth considerably more to me based on its broader potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You're making a significant concession ($200,000) to signal flexibility but remain well above both Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""broader potential,"" you reinforce the idea that the product has value beyond Bob's immediate assessment, justifying the higher price.
* **Pressure and Option:**  This counteroffer puts the ball back in Bob's court. You are still in a position to walk away and take John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has increased his offer substantially, indicating a strong desire to purchase. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the risk of negotiations stalling or Bob backing out entirely. While you could push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal."
