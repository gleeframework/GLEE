"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm looking for $25000 for it. Would you be interested?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15000? I think that's a fair price for this product.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $20000? I think it's a fair compromise.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $20000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $18000? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price.",18000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $18000. How about we meet at $22000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product.",22000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to make a profit, but $22000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18000 and $22000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $20000? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",20000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $20000. How about we meet at $21000? I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product.",21000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've been willing to meet you halfway and compromise, but $21000 is still too high for me. I'm going to have to think about buying from John at $8000 if we can't come to an agreement. Would you be willing to accept my previous offer of $18000? I really think that's a fair price for the product.",18000.0,Bob,8,
