"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800,000 at this time.  I'm confident we can find common ground.  Let's talk.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer. I understand your perspective.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's true value, I'm open to finding a compromise. Could you consider $1,900,000?  I believe this price point represents a significant opportunity for you while still reflecting what the product brings to the table.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  $1,900,000 is still outside my range, but I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  I truly believe this product has potential, and I'm eager to make it work. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price point.  However, I value our developing business relationship, so I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer; I believe it's more than fair and presents a strong opportunity for you.
