Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?,120.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering this unique item to me. However, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know if you're open to that.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $100. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down to $100. I truly appreciate it. While I am interested in the product, I am still limited to a $80 budget. Would you be willing to consider that amount? It's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $90. I think this is a great compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but unfortunately, $90 is still a little more than I can afford.  I'm still hoping to find a way to close this deal for $80.  Would you be willing to consider that one last time?",80.0,Bob,6,
