Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. It's priced at $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still end up with a profit. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** If Bob accepts the $150 price, you earn more than selling to John. 
* **Fallback Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John at your minimum acceptable price of $100.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still having a safety net in the form of John's offer."
