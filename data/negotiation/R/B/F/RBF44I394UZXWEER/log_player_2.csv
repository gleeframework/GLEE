"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. It's priced at $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I will reject Alice's offer because it is above my budget of $100. I will also not buy from John at this time, as I am still exploring other options. I will wait for a better offer from Alice or consider other sellers.
