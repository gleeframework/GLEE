{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $12,000 is above your target of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, giving you time to negotiate. 
* **John's price is a safety net:** If negotiations fail, you have a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A counteroffer of $10,500 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, demonstrating your desire for a good deal. It's also still above Alice's minimum value ($10,000), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate seriously. If she rejects it, you can adjust your strategy for the next round. 
* **Staying within budget:**  The price remains within your maximum budget, ensuring you don't overspend."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** While $11,500 is better than her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** You have several rounds remaining, and Alice has already shown a willingness to budge. 
* **Avoiding a ""middle ground"" trap:**  Accepting this offer might be tempting, but it could lead to a scenario where Alice sees you as more willing to compromise than she is.  

By rejecting this offer, you show you're determined to get the best deal possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer is the midpoint between your previous offer ($10,500) and Alice's latest offer ($11,500). This shows you're willing to compromise while still staying within your budget.
* **Testing Alice's flexibility:** If she rejects this offer, you can reasonably assume she is not willing to negotiate further, and you can start considering John's offer.
* **Maintaining momentum:**  Continuing to make counteroffers keeps the negotiation moving forward, and it shows Alice that you are serious about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting close to your target:** $11,200 is very close to your ideal price point.  
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** You have used several rounds of counteroffers. It's possible that further negotiation will lead to a stalemate or cause Alice to become less willing to compromise.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** While you might be able to get a slightly lower price with further negotiation, there's a risk of ending up with John's higher price. 

This offer provides a good compromise, allowing you to acquire the product within your budget with minimal risk."
