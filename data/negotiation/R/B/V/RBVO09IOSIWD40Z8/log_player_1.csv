"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than the value of the product to me, and I have time to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still gives you a great deal, considering the value this product will bring you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than the product's true value. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 still doesn't reflect the true value this product will bring to your business. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $925,000 is getting closer to his perceived value of the product, it's still significantly less than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I believe I can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable price or at least reach a point where selling to John becomes the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer. While I understand you're looking for a bargain, $925,000 is just too far off from what this product is worth. I'm willing to go down to $950,000 one last time. This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm afraid $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to pay. I'm starting to lose interest in the deal if we can't meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is stubbornly holding on to his low offer, and I'm running out of time. It's clear that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  Given the risk of further negotiation failure, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This ensures I secure the best possible price and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
