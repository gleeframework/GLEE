"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still gives you a great deal, considering the value this product will bring you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 still doesn't reflect the true value this product will bring to your business. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and make it happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer. While I understand you're looking for a bargain, $925,000 is just too far off from what this product is worth. I'm willing to go down to $950,000 one last time. This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm afraid $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to pay. I'm starting to lose interest in the deal if we can't meet at this price.",900000.0,Bob,8,
