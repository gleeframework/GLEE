{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:**  This initial offer gives me a strong starting point and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counter without me feeling pressured to sell for significantly less than my minimum. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll have to weigh his counteroffer against John's guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's counteroffer is lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is interested in the product and has indicated a willingness to compromise. 
* **John as Safety Net:** While I'm open to further negotiation with Bob, I'm not desperate.  John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 provides me with a strong fallback position if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I've moved closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  
* **Maintaining Value:**  However, I'm still above his initial offer and close to my minimum value. 
* **Negotiating Room:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation, acknowledging that Bob might still have some wiggle room. 
* **John's Guarantee:** I'm  keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,150,000, but I still think it's a bit too high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,075,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Lower Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.
* **Unlikely to Reach Agreement:**  While Bob is willing to negotiate, it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  His latest offer is getting closer to his maximum value, while I'm still significantly above my minimum.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** Given the circumstances, it's wiser to accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. It's the best option to secure my desired price and minimize the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
