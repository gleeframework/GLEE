"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a fair deal. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,150,000, but I still think it's a bit too high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,075,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
