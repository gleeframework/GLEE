{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This initial offer starts high, giving you room to negotiate down if Bob counter-offers. It also expresses willingness to negotiate, which makes the offer more appealing.  Keep in mind that you can always choose to sell to John for $8,000 if you feel Bob isn't willing to pay a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the negotiation. I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still a bit low. By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and try to get a bit closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9250 is still a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $9000? I'm really serious about buying this product and believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to your desired price.  Accepting it allows you to get a good price for your product, and avoids further negotiation.  While you could potentially get a bit more, the risk of Bob walking away or further negotiation is not worth it for a $100 difference."
