"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the negotiation. I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value at that price.",9250.0,Alice,3,
