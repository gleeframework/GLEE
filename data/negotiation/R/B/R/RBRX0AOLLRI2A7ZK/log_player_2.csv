"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the negotiation. I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $9,250 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his $8,500 counteroffer."
