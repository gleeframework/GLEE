It's too early to say if $9,500 is a good deal.  Let's see if we can get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. I'm hoping to get the price down significantly."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still well below Alice's price.  I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about buying but also that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

Alice is still quite a bit higher than where I want to be.  Let's see if we can get her down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a significant amount.  While I'd prefer to get it lower,  $8,750 is a good deal compared to John's price, and we are getting close to the end of the rounds. It's time to close this deal."
