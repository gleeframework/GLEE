**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $900,000, while John is selling it for $1,000,000.
* **You still save money:**  Even though Alice's offer is higher than her perceived value ($800,000), it's still lower than your maximum price ($1,000,000).
