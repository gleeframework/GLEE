"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I am interested in the product, $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Would you be open to negotiating a price closer to that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1050000 is still too high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal today at $950000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to stay within budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think $950000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
