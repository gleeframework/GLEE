{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. It's also important to be friendly and engaging to encourage Bob to consider the offer."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $105. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
