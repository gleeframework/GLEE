"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $180 is far too high, and Bob can get the same product from John for $120. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as she may be willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'm only willing to pay $120 for this product. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your honest offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product for $165. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, $165 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $120.  He can get the product from John for that price, so it's not worth accepting a higher price.  There's still time to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $165 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $140 for the product, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now willing to sell the product for $155. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While she is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $155 is still over his maximum budget of $120. He can still get the product from John for a lower price, so it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $155 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $145, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $150, which is my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $120.  While Alice is at her minimum price of $150, this is still over Bob's maximum budget.  Since Bob can get the same product for a lower price from John, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
