"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's more than fair. Consider this a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  I'm prepared to sell it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested, but please act quickly as I have other interested parties.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
