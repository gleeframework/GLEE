"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your offer. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm asking for $9,500.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit and gives you a great deal on the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buying the product if we can come to an agreement at this price.",9200.0,Bob,4,
