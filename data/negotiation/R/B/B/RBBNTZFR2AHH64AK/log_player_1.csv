Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $1,200,000 to John.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's higher than your minimum but lower than Bob's maximum. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing your potential profit.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start by highlighting the exclusivity and value of the product.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,350,000 is:
    * $150,000 above your minimum, giving you a significant profit.
    * $150,000 below Bob's perceived value, making it attractive to him.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. You might need to slightly lower your price, but always aim to stay above your $1,200,000 minimum."
