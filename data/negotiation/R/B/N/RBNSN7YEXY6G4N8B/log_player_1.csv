Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't afford $14,000. I'm willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. It's too low for the value of my product. I'm hoping I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $12,500. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better offer in the next few rounds, so I'll take it."
