"Round 1

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's interest.  A 20% reduction from her initial price is a substantial offer, and hopefully, it will encourage Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is showing some flexibility, but $850,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay. I'll counter again to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm offering $800,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  This shows good faith and hopefully gets us closer to a deal."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is being stubborn, but I'm still not willing to settle at $875,000. I'll counter again, hoping to reach a price we both can agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm going to split the difference between my last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully gets us closer to a deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is moving up in price again. While $900,000 is still a significant savings from John's price, I'm not willing to budge at this point. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find common ground before running out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm sticking with my last offer of $850,000.  We're getting close, and hopefully, Alice will see that this is a fair price.  I'm not willing to go higher at this point, so I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and Alice is still not budging.  While $925,000 is a good price, it's not as low as I hoped, and it's getting too risky to continue with this negotiation.  I'll buy the product from John for $1,500,000.  Even though it's more expensive, I'm guaranteed to get the product and avoid further potential losses."
