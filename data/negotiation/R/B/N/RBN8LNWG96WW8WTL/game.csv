"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a new price of $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair middle ground that meets your needs and still reflects the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $725,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $825,000 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,7,
