"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. Would you like to make an offer to purchase it?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to get closer to your minimum price, but $1050000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $975000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $975000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1075000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1075000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $987500?",987500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, $987500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1095000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a good deal.",1095000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not getting any younger, and I'm not willing to go much higher. I'll meet you halfway from $1095000, so how about $1047500?",1047500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not getting any younger, Bob, but I'm not getting any younger either. I've made several concessions already, and I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1100000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a good deal. I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1100000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made it this far, and I'm not willing to give up now. I'll make one final offer of $1050000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to walk away and consider other options.",1050000.0,Bob,10,
