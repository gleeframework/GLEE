"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it's worth a lot to you, so I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value to me is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the value it brings."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,750?  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $8,750 is close, but I need to be closer to $9,000. Would you consider $8,850? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8850} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:**  By stating this is my final offer, it adds weight and urgency for Bob to accept.
* **Minimal Concession:** The counter-offer shows a willingness to negotiate but holds firm on achieving a price closer to Alice's desired value.
* **Time Pressure:**  As rounds progress, the limited time frame encourages both parties to reach an agreement."
