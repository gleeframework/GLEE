Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to get closer to the price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
My goal is to maximize my profit. While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000. I will counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $11,000?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, hoping to close the deal at a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $10,250. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good deal for both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this time."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and compromise on the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to accept this deal than to risk losing the sale altogether.  At this price, I'm breaking even, and that's acceptable given the time spent negotiating."
