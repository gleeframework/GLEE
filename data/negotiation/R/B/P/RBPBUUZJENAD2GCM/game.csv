"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to get closer to the price I'm comfortable with.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $11,000?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $10,250. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good deal for both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this time.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and compromise on the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",10000.0,Bob,6,
