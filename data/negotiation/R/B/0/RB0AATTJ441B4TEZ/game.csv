,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700000. Can you meet me in the middle?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $700000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This still reflects the unique value of the product, but it's a significant compromise from my initial price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000. Can you meet me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750000 is still a bit too low for me. This product is truly special, and I'm confident it will be worth more to you than that in the long run. I'm willing to come down to $825000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your commitment to the product.  However, $775000 is still a bit short of what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $790000, which is a significant concession given its value.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",790000.0,Alice,7,
