"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you consider $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference at $157.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",157.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $157.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $150?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
