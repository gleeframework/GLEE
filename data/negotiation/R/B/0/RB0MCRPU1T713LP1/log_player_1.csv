I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell at $11,000, I'm confident I can do better. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12,500? That's still a fair price for this amazing product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250

``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. $12,250 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's $12,000 offer."
