"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth more than that to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  While Bob values the product at $12,000, Alice is offering it for $10,000. This saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* **No need to consider John's offer:** Since Alice's offer is better, there's no reason to consider buying from John."
