"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your desire to save money. However, $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $13,000. Let's split the difference and meet at that price.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'd like to propose a compromise at $12,800. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",12800.0,Bob,4,
