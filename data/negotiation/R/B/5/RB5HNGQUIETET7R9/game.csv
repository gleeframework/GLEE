"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is still a significant profit for you and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $875,000? This is a solid price that's closer to our middle ground and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",900000.0,Alice,5,
