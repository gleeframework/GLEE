"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe $1,800,000 undervalues the unique advantages this product offers.  To move this forward, I could consider $2,100,000. This reflects a willingness to compromise while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
