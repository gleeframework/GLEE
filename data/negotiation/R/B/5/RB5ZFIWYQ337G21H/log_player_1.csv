I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It's important to start high to maximize my potential profit, but I also want to be mindful that Bob might reject this offer outright.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a good price, I think I can get more.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,275,000 is still a good deal.  It's higher than what John is offering, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
