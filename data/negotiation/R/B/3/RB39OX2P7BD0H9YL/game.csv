"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product, but $18,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price, as it's well below what you're asking, and still allows you a healthy profit. Let's work together to make this happen.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to work together to make this deal happen. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and is within my budget. This is a good compromise that shows my willingness to work with you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I'll sell the product to you for $13,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it's a bit closer to my target price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",13500.0,Alice,5,
