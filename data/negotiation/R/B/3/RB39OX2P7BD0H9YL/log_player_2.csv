Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to work together to make this deal happen. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and is within my budget. This is a good compromise that shows my willingness to work with you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I'll sell the product to you for $13,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it's a bit closer to my target price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly over his limit. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
