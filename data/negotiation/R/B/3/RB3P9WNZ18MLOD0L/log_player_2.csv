# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
