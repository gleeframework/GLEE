"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider coming down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $750,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000.  Let's make this deal happen!",775000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, but no lower. This is the last concession I can make, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",795000.0,Alice,7,
