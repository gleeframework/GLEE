"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it offers excellent value at this price, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $8,500.  Would you consider $9,000? It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value for Bob:** Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000.
* **Alice's offer:**  Alice is now offering $9,000.
* **Negotiation progress:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Risk of rejection:**  If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might be even less willing to negotiate further.  There's a chance she might stick to her price, or even increase it.
* **Buy from John:** John's offer is still $10,000, making Alice's offer a better deal for Bob.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $9,000 is the most logical decision in this scenario. It saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John, and it's likely a better outcome than risking further negotiations with Alice."
