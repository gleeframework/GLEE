"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $750,000 at this time. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $850,000 is closer, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $820,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work.",820000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $820,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000, and I'll throw in some additional features that will enhance the product's value. This is my final offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
