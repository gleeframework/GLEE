Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to his perceived value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my initial offer and is above my minimum acceptable price of $80. Accepting his offer is the best option in this scenario, as it maximizes my profit while avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection."
