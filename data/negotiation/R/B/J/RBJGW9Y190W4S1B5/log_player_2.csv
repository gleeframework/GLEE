"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $100 from John, so anything above $100 is a bad deal for you.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still a bit too high. Offering $90 is a reasonable counteroffer that is closer to your desired price point while still leaving some room for negotiation.  It's also below the price John is offering, so it's still a better deal for you."
