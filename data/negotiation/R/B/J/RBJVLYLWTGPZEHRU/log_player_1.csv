I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum desired price of $15,000, but it's still a profitable deal for me. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob decides to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to avoid selling to John, I'm not willing to accept a price so far below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and try to find a price that's more reasonable for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway, offering a more reasonable price while still allowing me to make a profit.  I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm also prepared to consider another counteroffer from him if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, his counteroffers keep getting lower, and I'm not willing to go that low.  John is offering a price that meets my minimum requirements, so it's a better option for me right now."
