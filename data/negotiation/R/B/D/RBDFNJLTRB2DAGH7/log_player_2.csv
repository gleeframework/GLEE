Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a valuable asset that's worth significantly more to you than to me.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,050,000 is my absolute minimum.
