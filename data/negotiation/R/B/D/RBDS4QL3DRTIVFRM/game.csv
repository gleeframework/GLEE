"Hi Alice,  $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm very interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. Would you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $10000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $12000 to seal the deal. It's a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12000 is still a little outside my budget.  I'm ready to close the deal today, but I can only do $11000.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
