Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
