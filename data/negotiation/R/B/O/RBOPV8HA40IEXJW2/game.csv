"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I can do $10,500, and that's as low as I can go. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on a high-value product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
