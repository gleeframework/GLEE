Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. It also signals the value I place on the product and sets a high baseline for the negotiation.  I'm prepared to counter if needed, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob is unwilling to meet my expectations."
