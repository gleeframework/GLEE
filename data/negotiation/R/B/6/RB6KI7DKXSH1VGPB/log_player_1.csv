Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $13,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth $12,000 to you, and it gives me a little room to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $11,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $11,500 is too low for me, especially since the product is worth $12,000 to him. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for you since you value the product at $12,000. Let's meet halfway!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $12,500. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is the value you mentioned it has to you. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it aligns with the value he has for the product.  It's a good deal for both of us."
