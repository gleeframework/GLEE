Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. Would you consider adjusting the price to something closer to my maximum willingness to pay, which is $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for a compromise at $950,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's not moving fast enough.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John and move on."
