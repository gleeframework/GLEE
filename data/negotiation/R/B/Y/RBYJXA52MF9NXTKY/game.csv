"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a price of $9,500. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to make one last compromise. I'm prepared to go down to $10,500.  This is my final offer, as I have another buyer willing to pay my full asking price. Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling to the other buyer.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not sure I can meet you at $10,500. I'd be willing to go up to $10,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,6,
