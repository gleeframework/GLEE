Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $650,000 is significantly below its value. I could be flexible, but I need a price that makes this worthwhile for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise.
