"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1075000. This would allow you to get the product at a price that's within your budget and still give me a fair return. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
