I'm willing to come down to $1075000. This would allow you to get the product at a price that's within your budget and still give me a fair return. What do you think?

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is still within your budget and a good deal considering you can buy the product from John for $1,000,000. Accepting Alice's offer means you save $25,000 compared to buying from John."
