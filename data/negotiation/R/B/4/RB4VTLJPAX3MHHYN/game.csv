"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $12,500.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's try to find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I see you're serious about this product. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? That's a very fair offer considering its value.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really interested in this product, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $10,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,6,
