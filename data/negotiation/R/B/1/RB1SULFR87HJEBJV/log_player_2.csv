I'm interested in purchasing, but I can only offer $1,250,000 at this time. This price is still fair considering the value you're offering, and allows for a decent profit margin for you. Please let me know if you're open to this offer."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, to ensure we both achieve a satisfactory outcome, I propose a final price of $1,300,000 for the product. This price still reflects the value and quality of our product while providing a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope this revised offer aligns better with your financial considerations. I look forward to your feedback.

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is $1,300,000, which is still within your budget of $1,500,000.
* While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to compromise further, or you might end up paying more if you go to John.
* Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product at a price that's better than what John is offering while still being within your financial constraints."
