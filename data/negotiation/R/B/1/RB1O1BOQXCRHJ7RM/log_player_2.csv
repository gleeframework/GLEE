Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $550,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $560,000. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount and sell the product to you for $585,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $585,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $585,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $585,000 is getting close to my target price. While I can still try to negotiate further, the risk of not closing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price is too great.  I'm going to accept this offer and secure the product."
