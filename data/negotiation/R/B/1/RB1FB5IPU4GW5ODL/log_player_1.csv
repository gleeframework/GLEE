# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty and the effort you've put into our negotiations. I'm willing to acknowledge that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already considered buying from John for $800,000, and I'm not sure I can justify spending $980,000. My final offer is $920,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the purchase.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has shown he's unwilling to meet a price point that represents a reasonable profit for Alice. He's aware of John's offer and is using it as leverage to lowball. Accepting $920,000 is a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,200,000.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
