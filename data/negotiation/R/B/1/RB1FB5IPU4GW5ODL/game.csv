"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a respectable offer, the value this product represents doesn't quite align with that figure.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,025,000? This demonstrates my willingness to move towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about we compromise at $950,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept $950,000. The value of this product is simply too high for me to go that low. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our negotiations and believe you would be a great fit for this product.  My absolute final offer is $980,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see you acquire it.  Let me know your thoughts.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your honesty and the effort you've put into our negotiations. I'm willing to acknowledge that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already considered buying from John for $800,000, and I'm not sure I can justify spending $980,000. My final offer is $920,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the purchase.",920000.0,Bob,6,
