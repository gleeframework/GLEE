"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and I'm interested in purchasing it, however, my budget is limited to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $13,000?  This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the offer. How about we aim for $12,500? It's a bit higher than my initial offer but still within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate you coming up in your offer. $12,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we compromise at $12,800? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",12800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Let's try $12,700. It's a bit higher than my initial offer but still within my budget and closer to your needs.",12700.0,Bob,6,
