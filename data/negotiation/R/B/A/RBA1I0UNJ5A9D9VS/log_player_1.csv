Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Since Bob values the product significantly more than your minimum, there's room for negotiation.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Considering its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal given the potential benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him. 
* **""Fair Deal"" Language:**  Framing it as a ""fair deal"" encourages Bob to see it as mutually beneficial.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a profit of $150,000 over your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  You have room to negotiate down slightly, potentially settling around $1,300,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your minimum price. While not ideal, you still achieve your baseline goal."
