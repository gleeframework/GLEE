Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $9,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250 to make this deal work.  This is still a fantastic price for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $9,250 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I'm confident we can find common ground at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $9,000 is a good price for me, and it's worth it to avoid further negotiations.  I'm confident I can't get a much better price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John."
