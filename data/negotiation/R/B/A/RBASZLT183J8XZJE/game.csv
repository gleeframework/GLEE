"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down a bit?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140? That would be a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still a bit higher than $120.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm still aiming for $120. It's a firm offer, and I'm ready to close the deal right now if you're interested.",120.0,Bob,6,
