"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140? That would be a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still a bit higher than $120.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate downwards. We've reached our maximum budget, but there's still room to negotiate before resorting to John's offer.  Let's see if Alice will come down further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm still aiming for $120. It's a firm offer, and I'm ready to close the deal right now if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**  By repeating our firm offer and expressing a desire to close the deal, we're applying a bit of pressure. Alice may be more inclined to accept knowing that we have a backup option."
