"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  $14,500 is less than $15,000.
* **But you can likely do better:**  You know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives you leverage to try to get a lower price."
