"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $15,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product which is great to see. $15,750 is getting closer, but I still need it to be a bit higher. How about $16,125 and we have a deal?",16125.0,Alice,5,
