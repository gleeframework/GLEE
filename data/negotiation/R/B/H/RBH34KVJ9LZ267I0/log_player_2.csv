# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to make a special offer just for you. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000.  You have room to negotiate or see if Alice will lower her price further."
