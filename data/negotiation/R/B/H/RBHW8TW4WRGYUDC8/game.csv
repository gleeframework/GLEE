"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its potential, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment. Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
