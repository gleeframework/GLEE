"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product at a price of $11,000. I believe this product will be highly beneficial for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer of $12,000, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value to me."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction while still leaving some room for negotiation.  Offering $9,500 is a reasonable counteroffer, as it is below his maximum value of $12,000 and leaves room for Alice to make a concession without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is a reasonable compromise.  It's lower than her initial offer of $11,000 but still higher than Bob's counteroffer of $9,500.  Accepting this offer would save Bob $1,750 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially advantageous option at this point.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers or that he might end up paying more by going back and forth."
