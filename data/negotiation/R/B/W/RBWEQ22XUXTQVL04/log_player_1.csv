Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but the ""limited-time offer"" and mention of another buyer create a sense of urgency and scarcity. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price that's beneficial for both of us but still above my minimum."
