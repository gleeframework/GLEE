# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $12,000 is still higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000), meaning there's room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

**Reasoning:**

* You're still trying to save as much money as possible. 
*  Alice's offer of $11,500 is still higher than your ideal price, and you know she's willing to negotiate further. 
* Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try and get a lower price again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a bit of a discount, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is already a significant concession from my initial offer of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **You're saving money:** Alice's offer of $11,000 is still significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is getting tougher:** Alice has already made several concessions, and further negotiation might push her to walk away from the deal entirely.
* **Risk of losing out:**  If you continue to reject offers, there's a risk that Alice will get frustrated and stop negotiating, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price. 

While you might be able to push for a slightly lower price, accepting $11,000 is a good compromise that saves you $4,000 compared to buying from John."
