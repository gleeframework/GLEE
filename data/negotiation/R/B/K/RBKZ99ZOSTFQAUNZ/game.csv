Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.,12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $12000 to me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, but I think it's a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Can you meet me in the middle at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if you're interested!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $11000 to me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it, but I'm starting to think I might need to consider buying it from John for $10000. Can you meet me at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
