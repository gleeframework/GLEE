Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit. By mentioning the value and potential of the product, I'm subtly trying to gauge Bob's interest and get him to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $600000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $600,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is lower than what I initially offered, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $850,000?  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. While $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $750000 for the product. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial target.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $750,000 is closer to what I'm looking for.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
