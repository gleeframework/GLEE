"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is too low, and it's still below my minimum desired price of $150. While selling to John for $150 is an option, I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob a bit more.  There are still 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but $150 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  Let's see if we can make this work. "", ""product_price"": 150}
