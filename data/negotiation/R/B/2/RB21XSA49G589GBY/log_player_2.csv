"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $100 is still a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for us to meet somewhere in the middle.  Our goal is to get the price as close to $60 as possible, but we're willing to go up if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $85. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met us halfway between our offer and her original price.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and we risk losing the deal. $85 is a reasonable price and within our budget."
