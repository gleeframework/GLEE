"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $115?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
