"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at around $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $18,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could potentially stretch to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit.",10000.0,Bob,4,
