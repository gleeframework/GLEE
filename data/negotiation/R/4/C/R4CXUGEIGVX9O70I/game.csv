"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm looking to get a good return on my investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, and I do see the value in this product. However,  $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $800000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $850000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you and the price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",850000.0,Alice,3,
