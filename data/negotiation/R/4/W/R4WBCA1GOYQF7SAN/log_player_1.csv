Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn a significant amount.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By starting at $12,000, I create space for Bob to make counteroffers, allowing us to engage in a back-and-forth process.
* **Protecting my minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum of $15,000, so I'm not risking selling the product for less than it's worth to me.
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone in the message can help create a positive atmosphere for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would be a huge loss.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially reaching a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000. This gives me leverage in negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:**  I'm reducing my price slightly from my initial offer, showing flexibility. However,  I'm staying well above Bob's offer to maintain leverage.
* **Highlighting value:**  I remind Bob that $10,000 is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  Continuing with a friendly and encouraging tone helps keep the negotiation open and prevents the conversation from becoming adversarial.

**Next steps:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll consider further reducing my price, keeping in mind the value of the product to me and John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000, which is the price John is offering. Can you meet me at that price or lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is not budging:** Bob has made it clear that he's only willing to pay $8,000, a price far below my minimum.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000, a price significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing out on the higher offer from John.

**Conclusion:** It's in my best interest to sell the product to John, ensuring I receive the highest possible price and avoid further potentially unsuccessful negotiations with Bob."
