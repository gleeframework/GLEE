"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a good deal too. How about we meet at $125? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",125.0,Alice,5,
