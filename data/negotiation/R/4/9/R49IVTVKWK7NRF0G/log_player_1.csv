Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, giving him a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys from you.
* **The Goal:**  Maximize your profit by getting as close to $1,200,000 as possible without pushing Bob to reject the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I know it's something that could significantly benefit your operations, and I'm confident it's worth a considerable investment.  I propose a price of $1,150,000. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,150,000 sets a strong initial point in the negotiation, leaving room for potential adjustments if needed.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying the high price.
* **Time Limit:** The 24-hour limit adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision promptly. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob tends to negotiate aggressively, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,125,000) to give more room for negotiation.
* **Market Factors:**  Are there other potential buyers besides Bob and John? If demand is high, you could potentially push for an even higher price.

**Key Point:**  This is a single-round negotiation, so your initial offer needs to be strong and well-calculated."
