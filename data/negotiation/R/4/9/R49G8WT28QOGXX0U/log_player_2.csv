Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $125. You've been steadily increasing your offer, and she's indicated this is her bottom line.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $120, it makes more financial sense to do so and save the extra $5."
