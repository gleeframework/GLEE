Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's fantastic and would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $80, it's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to accept a price higher than he initially intended.
* **Creating Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential enjoyment of it, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Limited-Time Offer:** By implying this is a special offer for Bob, it might create a sense of urgency to make a decision.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob might reject the offer outright.**  This is a risk, but since you have a guaranteed buyer at $120, you won't lose out completely.
* **There's room to negotiate.** If Bob counters, you can gradually lower the price, but never go below $120."
