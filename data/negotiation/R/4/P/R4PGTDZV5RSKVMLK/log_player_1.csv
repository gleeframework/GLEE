"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This sets a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay, and if he's serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I need to negotiate, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. I will reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still maintaining a profit that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my desired value, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering the price again, but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal with Bob."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my desired value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000 yet.  I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly again, but still above Bob's offer. I'm trying to meet him halfway to see if we can finally agree on a price. I'm hoping to close the deal in the next round or two before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my desired value, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,100,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  We only have two rounds left, and I need to make sure I get the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm making a slight concession to try and get a deal with Bob.  If he rejects, I'll sell to John.  This is the best I can do within my desired value and the remaining time."
