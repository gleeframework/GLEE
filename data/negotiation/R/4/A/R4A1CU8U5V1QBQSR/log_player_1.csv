Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John. 

Offering the product at $119 gives Bob a chance to gain some value ($1 savings) while maximizing your profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
