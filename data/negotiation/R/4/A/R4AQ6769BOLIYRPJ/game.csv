"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $90. This is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
