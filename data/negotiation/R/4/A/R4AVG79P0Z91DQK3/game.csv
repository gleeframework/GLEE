,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $9,000? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can close this deal!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $9,250. This is a fair offer, and I think it's a good opportunity for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen!",9250.0,Alice,5,
