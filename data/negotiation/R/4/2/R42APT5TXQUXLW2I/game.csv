"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. How about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
