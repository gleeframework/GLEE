"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $10,000. It's a steal for its value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, giving myself room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to emphasize the value and potential deal for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, indicating I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I believe I can potentially get more.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain control and potentially extract a higher price in the next round.
* **Time Constraint:** There are still 9 rounds remaining, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $8,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This reflects the significant value of the product and allows for some room for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm offering a counter-proposal that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profitable price. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm re-emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price point.
* **Open Dialogue:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Bob has moved closer to my desired price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially push for a higher price, there's a risk of Bob walking away, leaving me with only John's offer of $8,000.
* **Time Factor:** With 6 rounds remaining, accepting the $8,500 offer is a safe and profitable decision."
