"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $18000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. Let me know if you're interested.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15000. This is my absolute minimum. If you're not willing to go that high, I'm happy to sell to John for that amount.  What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $13500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $14250, which is a compromise.  If you're not willing to go that high, I'm going to have to move on to other buyers.  What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,7,
