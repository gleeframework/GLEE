Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 20000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a strong offer above both my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** I frame the price as reflecting the ""true worth"" to make it seem less arbitrary and potentially appeal to Bob's desire for a valuable item.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware that I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000. This gives me leverage and allows me to be more firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price of $20,000. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is below my absolute minimum of $15,000. Accepting would mean a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a considerable gap between his offer and my initial ask. This suggests there's room to negotiate a better price. 
* **Backup Option:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives me a strong alternative if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm making a significant concession to show flexibility but remain firm that $12,000 is unacceptable.
* **Finality:** Stating ""This is my final offer"" adds pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still comfortably above my minimum ($15,000) and allows for potential further negotiation while keeping John as a viable alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth more to you, but I'm still not convinced that $18,000 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000 for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Slow Progress:** Negotiations are moving slowly, and Bob's counteroffers suggest he's unlikely to meet my minimum soon.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, eliminating further negotiation and potential losses.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
