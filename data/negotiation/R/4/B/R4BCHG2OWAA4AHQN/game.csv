"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price of $20,000. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is my final offer.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product is worth more to you, but I'm still not convinced that $18,000 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000 for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary.",14000.0,Bob,4,
