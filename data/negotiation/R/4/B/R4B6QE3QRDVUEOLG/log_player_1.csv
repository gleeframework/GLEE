"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's 20% higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a higher profit.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than my minimum. I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and get a price closer to what I'm looking for. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,100,000, which is still a good profit for me and is closer to Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will show him I'm serious about selling, but still want a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I want to exhaust all options with Bob before selling to John, as I believe I can get a better price with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm offering $1,050,000, which is closer to Bob's last offer and only $50,000 below my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, as I believe we are nearing a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum price. I'm happy to accept this offer and sell the product to him. Although I could sell to John for the same price, I'm satisfied with getting the product sold and moving on."
