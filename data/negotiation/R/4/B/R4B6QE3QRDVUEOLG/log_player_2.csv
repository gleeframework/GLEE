"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000. It's a bad deal for you right now.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $900,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully sets a good starting point for the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $950,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still holding firm to my belief that the product is worth less than $1 million to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still over my target. I'll reject this offer and try to get her down to $1 million or slightly above."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to try to close the deal by offering Alice exactly $1,000,000.  This is my maximum price, but it's also a fair price for both of us.  Hopefully, Alice will accept and we can finalize the transaction."
