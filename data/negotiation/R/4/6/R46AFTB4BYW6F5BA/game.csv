"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $16,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500 yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I think $14,000 is the lowest I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12,000. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $13,500 is the minimum I can accept. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
