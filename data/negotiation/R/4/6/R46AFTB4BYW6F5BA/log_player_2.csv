Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12,000. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $13,500 is the minimum I can accept. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?

It's unlikely Alice will go down to $12,000. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal with John."
