"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",8500.0,Alice,3,
