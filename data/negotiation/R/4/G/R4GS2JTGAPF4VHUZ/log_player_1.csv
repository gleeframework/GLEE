{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation, giving him some room to negotiate if he wants. It's also below your minimum acceptable price, allowing for some potential profit. This strategy aims to maximize your chances of reaching a deal while leaving room for counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, it's worth trying to secure a higher price. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value this product at $150, I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
