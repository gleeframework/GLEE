{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value, but not too far off.  This allows for negotiation and gives me room to potentially earn more than my minimum value. I'm also being friendly and engaging to encourage Bob to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I'd prefer to try and get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. How about $162.50? That would be fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 162.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe we could reach a fair price closer to my budget. Would $155 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $155 is close to my minimum value of $150 and also a significant improvement from his initial offer. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiations and secure a sale."
