"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor.  This might make Bob's counteroffers more favorable.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" and ""significant returns,"" the high price is framed as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language ""initially proposing"" and ""starting point for negotiations"" clearly signals  willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving room for a mutually agreeable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum. Rejecting this offer signals that you're serious about the product's worth and willing to negotiate further to reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is considerably below what I'd consider. This product offers significant long-term value that I believe you're undervaluing. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also reflects the true worth of this unique product."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Reject:** The message acknowledges Bob's counteroffer but firmly rejects it, stating it's ""considerably below"" your acceptable range.
* **Reiterate Value:**  The message reiterates the product's ""significant long-term value"" to subtly counter Bob's mention of ""current market conditions.""
* **Significant Concession, But Above Minimum:**  The counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a substantial decrease from the initial offer, showing flexibility. However, it remains significantly above your $1,000,000 minimum and allows room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product has significant long-term value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  While you have rounds remaining, Bob stating this is his ""final offer"" creates urgency. There's a risk he walks away if you counter again.
* **Solid Profit:** Accepting secures a $25,000 profit, which is a reasonable outcome considering the negotiation process. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale altogether by pushing for a marginally higher price."
