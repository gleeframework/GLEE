"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my target price, knowing it's likely too high for Bob. This will gauge his interest and give us a starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand $100 is your budget, I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves me with a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $130, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $110. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I won't settle for anything less than $130 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $110 is simply too low for me. I'm firm on $130.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on $130, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $120. Can we compromise on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to John for $150, Bob's offer of $120 is the highest he's been willing to go so far. It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm getting close to my limit with John and I don't want to risk losing a sale completely. Accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
