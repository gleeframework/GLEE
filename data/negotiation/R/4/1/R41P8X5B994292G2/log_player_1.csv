Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with the highest price I can. This is because:

* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed $120 from John, so I have no incentive to go lower initially.
* **Testing the waters:** This will immediately reveal if Bob is willing to pay my minimum price. 

If Bob rejects, I'll then evaluate his counteroffer and decide how to proceed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed $120 from John.
* **Negotiation room:** Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, but there's still room for negotiation. 

By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $115. 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Compromise:** This shows a willingness to compromise while still being above my minimum.
* **Testing ground:** This will give me a better gauge of how high Bob is willing to go. 

If he rejects again, I'll have to decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate or simply taking John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. 

Here's why:

* **Guaranteed profit:**  John's offer guarantees me my minimum profit.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** Bob's offer is getting closer to his valuation, which means I'm unlikely to get a much better deal.  Continuing to negotiate might just waste time and potentially lead to a lower price.

It's better to take the guaranteed profit and move on."
