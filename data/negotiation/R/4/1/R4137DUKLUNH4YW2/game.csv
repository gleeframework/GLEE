"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is tempting, I'm looking for a price closer to $11,000. This product is truly unique and I'm confident it's worth the investment. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000, which is the price I was originally quoted by John, but I'm willing to give you a slight premium for the product's uniqueness. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
