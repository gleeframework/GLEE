"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. That's closer, but still a bit rich for me.  How about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to be honest, I'm getting a bit anxious to close the deal. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  If you're willing to close this out today, I can do $900,000. That's the best I can offer.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $900,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I can offer the product to you for $920,000. This is my absolute final price, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal today.",920000.0,Alice,7,
