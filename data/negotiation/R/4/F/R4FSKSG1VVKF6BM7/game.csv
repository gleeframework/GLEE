"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1500000 is a fair starting point, I believe the product's potential warrants a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects a compromise on my part, but also ensures a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's work together to find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1700000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
