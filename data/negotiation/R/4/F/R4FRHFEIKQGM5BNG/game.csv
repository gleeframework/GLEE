"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. It's a compromise that I think we can both agree on.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit much for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still not able to go higher than $10,200. This is a fair price for a product that's worth $10,000 to me, and it allows you to make a profit. Let's close the deal.",10200.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,600.
