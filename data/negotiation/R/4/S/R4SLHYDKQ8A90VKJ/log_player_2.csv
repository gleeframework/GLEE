"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

Since the product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it at that price, there's no benefit in rejecting her offer. You might as well accept and save the time and effort of dealing with John."
