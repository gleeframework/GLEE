"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. Even though Alice has lowered her price,  $11,000 is still more than Bob's ideal price point.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a better deal for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $11,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $10800. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice's offer of $10,800 is closer to Bob's target price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate might allow Bob to get a better deal or force Alice to accept a price closer to Bob's target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $10,800 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $10,600.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $10700. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save money.  While Alice's offer of $10,700 is very close to Bob's target price, Bob can still try to negotiate a slightly lower price.  There is a chance that Alice may be willing to accept Bob's next counteroffer to get the deal done."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $10,700 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10,600.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10700. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $10650. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached a point where the potential savings from further negotiation are minimal. Alice's final offer of $10,650 is only slightly better than John's price of $10,000.  Given that there is only one round left, it's unlikely that Bob can get a significantly better price.  Therefore, it's more efficient for Bob to buy from John and avoid the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice."
