# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. However, I'm open to discussing the price further. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, my valuation for this product is significantly higher than what you've proposed.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and its potential benefits for you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. It's far more valuable than what you're currently offering. I'm willing to make a final offer at $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential this product holds for you.

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000. You'll save $200,000 by going with John's offer."
