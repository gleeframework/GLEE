"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's features. However, $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $150 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $165 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being more flexible with your budget constraints. I hope this proposal works for you. Looking forward to your feedback.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $165 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm happy to pay $157.50 for the product. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",157.5,Bob,4,
