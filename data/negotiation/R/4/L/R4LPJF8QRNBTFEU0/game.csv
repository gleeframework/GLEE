"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the VIP support, but $160 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. Would you be open to $145?",145.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $155? This still offers you the best value with our VIP support, while accommodating your financial considerations.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try $150. That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure I can still enjoy the benefits of your VIP support.",150.0,Bob,4,
