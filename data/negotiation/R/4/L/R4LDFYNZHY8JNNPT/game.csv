"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $10,500? This reflects the value I see in the product and would allow us to both walk away happy.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $11,750, but I believe the product's value is worth more than that. Can you meet me at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective. While I see the value in the product, $11,750 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $12,250. It's a bit above your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $12,250 is still a little too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle again at $11,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal, and we can move forward with the sale.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500. I'm thinking of $12,000, which is still a bit above my minimum price. I'm confident that the product's value will be worth it to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
