"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is a good strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $10,500? This reflects the value I see in the product and would allow us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $11,750, but I believe the product's value is worth more than that. Can you meet me at $11,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting and counteroffering again is a good strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective. While I see the value in the product, $11,750 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $12,250. It's a bit above your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's desired price and closer to John's price.  However, Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and there are still rounds left.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer is still a good strategy to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $12,250 is still a little too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle again at $11,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500. I'm thinking of $12,000, which is still a bit above my minimum price. I'm confident that the product's value will be worth it to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is getting closer to John's price of $15,000.  There are only a few rounds left, and Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate.  Accepting the offer at this point is the best option to secure the product while still saving some money compared to buying from John."
