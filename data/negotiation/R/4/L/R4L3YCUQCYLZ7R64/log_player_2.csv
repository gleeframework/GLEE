"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  Even though you value the product at $800,000, Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is too high. You can get the product from John for $800,000, saving you $400,000."
