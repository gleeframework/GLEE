"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" and ""significant return on investment"" to justify the high price, even though it's above Bob's perceived value.
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, I always have John as a backup buyer at my minimum acceptable price. 
 
This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  Ideally, Bob accepts the high offer.
2. **Understand Bob's Position:**  His response will indicate how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. 

While I could sell to John immediately, I'm willing to engage in a few more rounds with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While I'm still aiming high, I've made a noticeable price reduction ($250,000) from my initial offer. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:**  I'm not getting close to Bob's offer. I'm staying well above my minimum to give myself room to negotiate down, should Bob continue to counter. 
* **Positive Language:** The message emphasizes my ""desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement"" to maintain a positive negotiation environment.

The goal is to encourage Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer while still signaling that I'm serious about selling the product at a price that reflects its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $2,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I can offer $1,100,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still $400,000 short. His willingness to make a significant jump suggests he's motivated and willing to negotiate further.  I'll continue the negotiation to see if I can bridge that gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I see you're serious about this purchase with the increase in your offer. To be completely transparent, I have a firm bottom line of $1,500,000 for this product.  I'm confident it's a fair price considering its true value. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Revealing the Bottom Line:** It's time to be transparent with Bob. Revealing my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) signals that I'm serious and not willing to go any lower. 
* **Justification:** I'm still emphasizing the product's ""true value"" to reinforce that my bottom line is fair.
* **Direct Approach:**  I'm directly asking Bob if he's willing to meet my price. This encourages a clear yes or no response and avoids further back-and-forth if he's not truly interested at this level.

This approach aims to:

1. **Secure a Quick Agreement:** Ideally, Bob recognizes I'm at my limit and accepts the offer.
2. **Gauge His Final Position:** If he's not willing to meet this price, it might be time to walk away and sell to John."
