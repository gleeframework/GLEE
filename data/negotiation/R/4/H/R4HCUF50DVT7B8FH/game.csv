"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to pay $95 for it.  This would be a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit below my minimum price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $100? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",100.0,Alice,5,
