"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** While you could buy from John for $1,000,000, Alice is offering the same product for $950,000. 
* **You're still getting a good deal.**  The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and you're paying $950,000. This means you're getting a product worth more to you than you're paying for it."
