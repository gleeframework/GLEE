Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the exclusivity of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I still feel that $750,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that respects both our positions. My counteroffer remains at $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Bob seems firmly rooted at $750,000, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. It's time to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed $800,000 offer."
