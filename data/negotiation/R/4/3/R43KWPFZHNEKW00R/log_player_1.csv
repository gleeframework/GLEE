Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's valuation leaves space for potential counter-offers while staying above your minimum.
* **Time Value and Certainty:** Selling to Bob quickly and directly avoids the uncertainty of other buyers and gets you the money faster."
