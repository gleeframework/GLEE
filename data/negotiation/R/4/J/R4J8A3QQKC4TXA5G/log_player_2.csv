"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than your maximum valuation and John's offer. You should negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need a much lower price. Would you consider $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Politely Rejects:** Acknowledges the offer but makes it clear the current price is unacceptable.
* **Significant Drop:** The large decrease ($800,000) signals that Alice's starting point is far off.
* **Establishes a Position:**  Starting at $700,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying well under your $1,000,000 limit.
* **Not Too Low:**  Going too low might offend Alice. This offer aims to get a productive conversation started."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,500,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice moved towards a more reasonable price, it's still above both your limit and John's offer. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. To be honest, my budget for this is closer to $850,000.  If you're able to work within that range, I think we can make a deal."", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

Here's the strategy behind this counteroffer:

* **Acknowledges Progress:**  You start by acknowledging Alice's compromise, fostering a positive negotiation environment.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The phrase ""more than I'm comfortable spending"" sets a firm boundary without shutting down the conversation.
* **Reveals Budget (Partially):**  Giving a range around your budget can be a useful tactic. By saying ""closer to $850,000"" you imply flexibility but keep some room for maneuvering. 
* **Call to Action:** You end by reiterating your interest in a deal if Alice is willing to work within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. I think it's a fair price, considering the value this product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now very close to your $1,000,000 limit, and significantly below her initial offer.  While you could try to haggle further, the potential savings are now relatively small compared to the risk of Alice walking away. Accepting this offer gets you the product at a price reasonably below what you were willing to pay."
