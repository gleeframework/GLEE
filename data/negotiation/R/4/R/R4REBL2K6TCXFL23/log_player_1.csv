Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price slightly below the middle ground between our values, hoping to pique Bob's interest while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also keeping the message friendly and open-ended to encourage a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll counter with a price closer to $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet halfway at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to accept this offer rather than risk losing the deal entirely.  It's also the same price I could sell to John, so there's no need to take any more risks."
