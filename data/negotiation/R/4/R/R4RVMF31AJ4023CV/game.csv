"I'm very interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Can we meet in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $850000, which would be $800000. Can we meet at this price?",800000.0,Bob,4,
