{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and his last offer is $10,600. This is closer to the minimum you are willing to accept than John's offer of $12,000. You might be able to get a higher price in the next round, but it's not guaranteed.  The risk of losing a sale to John outweighs the possibility of a slightly better offer from Bob in the next round."
