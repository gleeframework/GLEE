"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement quickly.
