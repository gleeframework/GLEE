"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?"", ""product_price"": 7250}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but $7,250 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $7,750? This would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but her offers are coming down slowly. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly better than John's offer of $8,000.  It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
