"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but $7,250 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $7,750? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",7750.0,Alice,5,
