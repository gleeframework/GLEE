"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but also ensures I'm aiming for the best possible outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that right away. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm coming down a bit, but still holding out for a higher price than Bob's initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not desperate to sell at his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd love to push for more, accepting his offer ensures I get a good deal and avoid risking going back and forth for too many rounds. It's also a better price than selling to John."
