"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $950,000, considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $775,000? I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  However,  $775,000 still undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for us both – would you consider $837,500?",837500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced about the price. I'd like to propose a price of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,6,
