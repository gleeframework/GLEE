"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1100000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I'm confident this price reflects the product's value to both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900000. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and the negotiations so far.",925000.0,Alice,5,
