"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking this product would be worth closer to  $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe your offer undervalues the potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true value and the benefits you'll gain.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still quite a ways off from what I have in mind. How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer is getting closer to where we need to be. Let's split the difference - I can go as low as $1,550,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us, considering the product's true worth.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current price is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider other options.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from. Let's make this easy â€“ I'm prepared to accept $1,400,000 for the product. This is a significant concession on my part, and it reflects my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.  I believe this is a very fair offer considering the value you're gaining.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer.  I can do $1,300,000, but I need to know your answer now. Otherwise, I'm going to go with another seller.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
