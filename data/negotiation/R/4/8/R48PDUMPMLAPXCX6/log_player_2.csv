"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, for a special price of $900,000. This is a significant discount considering its true value. It's a chance for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Let me know if you're interested.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is below her stated value, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You know you can get the product from John for $800,000.  Therefore, it's in your best interest to reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John."
