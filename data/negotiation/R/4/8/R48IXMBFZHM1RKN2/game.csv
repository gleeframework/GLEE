"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit high for you, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm hoping to spend.  How about we meet in the middle again at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
