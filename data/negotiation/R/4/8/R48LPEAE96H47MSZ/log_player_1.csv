"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great value considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) but still lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob room to counteroffer without feeling pressured. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to establish a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  I want to maximize my profit. 
* **Bob's offer:** While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my desired price.
* **Negotiation:** I believe there's room for further negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a price closer to my initial offer of $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $11,000 is a good price, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This gives us both a fair deal, and we can move forward with the sale. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by reducing my price slightly. 
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing fairness for both parties.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and conversational tone to keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:**  While $11,500 is not my ideal price, it's still $1,500 more than I would get from selling to John.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** We're already on the fourth round, and further negotiation may lead to a stalemate or even a lower price from Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting this offer minimizes risk and ensures a reasonable profit."
