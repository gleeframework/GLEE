"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is still below Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price leaves enough space for Bob to make a counteroffer while still potentially securing a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still $2,000 below my floor of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation space:** I have 8 rounds left, and I can still potentially secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Risk assessment:** Selling to John for $10,000 is safe, but I believe I can do better by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the offer. However, $12,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This reflects the value of the product for you while also allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him of its worth.
* **Positive and open tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and open to further negotiation, demonstrating my desire to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:** This counteroffer gives Bob more space to consider while still ensuring I don't drop below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $12,500 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, his offer is still below my floor of $10,000.
* **Time is on my side:** We have 6 rounds left, and I have a strong negotiating position.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can still secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal from Bob. 

I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement and willingness to meet in the middle. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  To ensure we both get a good deal, I'd like to propose $13,500. I believe this is a fair price that recognizes the product's value for you while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Incentive:** I'm increasing my offer to $13,500, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum. This move might incentivize Bob to accept as it's closer to his last offer.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** I'm re-emphasizing the mutual benefit of the deal, highlighting the value for Bob while ensuring my own profit.
* **Closing the Deal:** The message suggests a sense of urgency and a desire to finalize the deal, potentially prompting Bob to consider accepting.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer leaves room for Bob to make a slight counter, potentially reaching an agreement in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered your proposal carefully, and I would like to counter with a price of $13,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value you're offering. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired price range and significantly higher than my minimum of $10,000.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** We have only 4 rounds remaining, and I'm not sure if I can secure a higher price in the limited time.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Bob backing out, forcing me to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a favorable outcome while reducing the risk of further negotiation."
