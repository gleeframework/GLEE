Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John guarantees $1,200,000, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below its value to Bob ($1,150,000) creates a strong incentive for him to buy. This price still nets Alice a significant profit above her minimum.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:** By framing the offer as exclusive, it adds perceived value and encourages Bob to act quickly."
