Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to see Bob's initial reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm offering $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to sell for significantly less than what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $950,000 is a good price,  and it's likely that continued negotiation won't get me much higher.  I'd rather secure the sale and avoid the risk of further rejections or ending up selling to John for less."
