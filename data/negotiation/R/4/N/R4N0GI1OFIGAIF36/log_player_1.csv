Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $105 is still below my minimum value, and I have room to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $105 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to close the deal, $105 is still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price.  I have a few more rounds to try, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to drop my price to $108. This is a great deal for you, and it's the closest I can come to your offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $102, and that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although I'm starting to get nervous about running out of rounds, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $102 is still below my minimum, and I have a few rounds left to try and get closer to my desired price. It's risky, but I'm hoping I can get a better offer before having to sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're serious about this price, but $102 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's make this happen. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm surprised you're still not willing to budge. I'm willing to pay $102, and I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to walk away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. I've reached a point where I'm running out of rounds, and I'm worried that I won't be able to get a price close to my minimum. Even though I wanted to get a better deal, selling to John ensures that I make at least my minimum amount."
