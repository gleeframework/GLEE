"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. My asking price is $9,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make on the sale.  Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $8,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.",8250.0,Bob,4,
