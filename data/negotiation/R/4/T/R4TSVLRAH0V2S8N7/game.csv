"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $15,000. This is still a good deal considering its worth to you is $12,000, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise that would allow us to both benefit from the deal. Let's find a way to make this work.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is still a good deal for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
