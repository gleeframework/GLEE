"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $12,000. It's too risky to accept this offer without trying to negotiate. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $15,000. This is still a good deal considering its worth to you is $12,000, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still $3,000 above my maximum. I'll reject and counteroffer again. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise that would allow us to both benefit from the deal. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is still a good deal for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still $2,000 above my ideal price, but it's getting closer.  Given that I have limited rounds and there's no guarantee she'll go lower, accepting this offer seems like the best option.  It's a reasonable compromise that allows me to acquire the product without spending too much."
