"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product has incredible potential and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has potential, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,600,000 and $2,000,000, so how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,800,000 is really cutting it close to my bottom line. How about $1,950,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
