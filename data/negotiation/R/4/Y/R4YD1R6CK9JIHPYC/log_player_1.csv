Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has potential, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,600,000 and $2,000,000, so how about $1,800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,800,000 is a tempting offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob is clearly interested and willing to move closer to our desired price. I believe we can push for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,800,000 is really cutting it close to my bottom line. How about $1,950,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value this product brings."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,800,000 and $1,950,000, so how about $1,875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is consistently moving towards our price point, even if in smaller increments. $1,875,000 is a strong profit, and continuing to push risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting now secures a significant return."
