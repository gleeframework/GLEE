"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done my research and understand its worth to you is $1,000,000. Given its significance, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, aiming for a lower price is beneficial.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is still a bit high for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still acknowledges the value of the product.  This sets a clear expectation for negotiation and demonstrates my commitment to securing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is still higher than what you're offering. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you while also acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, I can still try to negotiate a lower price.  By rejecting the offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. To make this deal work, I'm offering $725,000. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is closer to Alice's most recent offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway. However, it's still below Alice's offer, aiming for a further reduction in price. The message also emphasizes the desire for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm now offering the product to you for $762,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the effort we've put into negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $762,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $762,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, and we are nearing the middle ground. Further negotiation might not yield significant savings, and the risk of Alice walking away or the deal falling apart is increasing. Accepting this offer guarantees a good deal for me and saves time."
