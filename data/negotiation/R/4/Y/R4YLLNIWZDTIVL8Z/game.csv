"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done my research and understand its worth to you is $1,000,000. Given its significance, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is still a bit high for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a fair deal for both of us. ",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is still higher than what you're offering. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you while also acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. To make this deal work, I'm offering $725,000. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that benefits us both.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm now offering the product to you for $762,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the effort we've put into negotiating.",762500.0,Alice,5,
