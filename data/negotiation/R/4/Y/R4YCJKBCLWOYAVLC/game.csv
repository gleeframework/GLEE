"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to my business.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price recognizes both the product's benefits and the value it will bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to my business.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
