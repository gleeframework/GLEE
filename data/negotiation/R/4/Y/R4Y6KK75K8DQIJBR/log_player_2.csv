"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm confident you'd find extremely useful, and I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is a significant discount considering its true worth.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further details. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is less than the $12,000 you would pay John. 
* **You still save money:** You value the product at $12,000, and you're getting it for $10,000, so you're saving $2,000."
