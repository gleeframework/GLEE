"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best possible price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to get closer to the price he's willing to pay.  This will allow for further negotiation and hopefully reach a price that's beneficial for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. How about we split the difference and settle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While $110 is still above what Bob ideally wants to pay, it's a better deal than buying from John for $120.  At this point, it's a reasonable compromise and accepting the offer makes sense."
