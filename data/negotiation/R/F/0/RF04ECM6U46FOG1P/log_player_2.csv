"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $100 is less than Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still some room for negotiation. Bob can try to get the price down further by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - $92.50. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $97.50. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $97.5 is getting closer to Bob's target price. While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk that Alice might harden her stance and the price could increase. It's also getting close to the 10-round limit, where buying from John would be the default. Accepting the offer is the safest strategy to secure a good deal within the time limit."
