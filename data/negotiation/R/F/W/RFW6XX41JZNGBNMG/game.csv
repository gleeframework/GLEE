"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and features, I believe a price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value and features of the product, but based on my budget, I am unable to meet the price of $22,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, based on my budget constraints, $16,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I would like to make one final counteroffer of $14,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",14000.0,Bob,4,
