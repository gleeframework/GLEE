{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice's offer is $110. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $105 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit over budget at $105. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'm offering it to you for $102.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $102.50 is still more than you're willing to pay. You've already had several rounds of negotiation and it's unlikely Alice will budge much further. It's best to cut your losses and buy from John at $80, ensuring you get the product within your budget."
