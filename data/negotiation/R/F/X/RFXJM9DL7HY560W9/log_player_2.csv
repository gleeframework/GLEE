"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that's worth at least $15,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you.  I'm offering it to you for $17,000. This is a fair price considering its worth, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $15,000. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $15,000.

Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to stay within your budget."
