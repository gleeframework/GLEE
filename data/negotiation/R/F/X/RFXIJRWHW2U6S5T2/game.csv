"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify the price of $18,000. Considering my budget, I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $15,000 is a bit steep given my budget. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
