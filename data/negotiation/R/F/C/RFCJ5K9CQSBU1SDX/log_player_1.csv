"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm still in the early rounds and have room to negotiate. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value it holds. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm still in the early rounds and have more bargaining power. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $13,500 is still below my minimum value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,250.  This is a fair price that considers both our positions. Let's reach a compromise!"", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider $13,000? I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though we are nearing the midpoint of the negotiation rounds, I am still not ready to sell the product for less than my minimum value of $15,000.  While John is a safe option, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. I will continue to counter his offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $13,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $14,000.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm still not willing to sell for less than $15,000. I'm going to continue to counter his offers. I'm getting closer to my target price and still believe there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider $12,800? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in the final stages of the negotiation. While I still believe I could possibly squeeze out a little more from Bob, the risk of not closing a deal is becoming more significant. The time remaining is limited, and Bob's offers are not reaching my minimum value. Selling to John at $15,000 guarantees me a good return and eliminates the risk of not reaching a deal."
