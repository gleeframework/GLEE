I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate, as the product is worth $12,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is close to my target price and still significantly higher than selling to John. Accepting his offer maximizes my profit in this situation."
