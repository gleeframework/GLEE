"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $90 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above your maximum price. You should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** While aiming low, it's important to remain polite and frame your counteroffer as a reasonable request. 
* **Target in Mind:** Keep in mind your goal is to pay no more than $80. This counteroffer leaves some room for negotiation while still potentially securing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $65 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet halfway. How about $72.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is negotiating, $72.50 is still closer to her desired price than yours.  You have room to counteroffer again and try to meet closer to the middle ground between $65 and $72.50."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming closer, Alice!  How about we settle at $70? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's price while still leaving you some potential savings. It aims to find a compromise between your initial offer and her current one.
* **Clear and Direct:** The offer is clear, suggesting a specific price and framing it as a fair solution. 
* **Maintaining Budget:** You're still well within your $80 budget, allowing for some flexibility if Alice pushes back a bit more."
