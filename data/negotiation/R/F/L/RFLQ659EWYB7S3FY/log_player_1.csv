Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You have a safety net with John ($15,000), so you don't have to accept anything less.
* **Starting high:**  It's always easier to come down in price than go up. Starting at $18,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Gauging interest:** This initial offer helps you understand how much Bob truly values the product. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, you can always counter-offer closer to his perceived value ($12,000) or accept John's offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, factors like your relationship with Bob and the product's urgency might influence your final offer."
