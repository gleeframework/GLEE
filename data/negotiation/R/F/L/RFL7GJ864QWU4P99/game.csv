"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the product's value while still allowing for a fair profit for me.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,600,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you be open to $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
