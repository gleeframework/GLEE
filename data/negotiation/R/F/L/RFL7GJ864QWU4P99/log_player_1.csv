Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000.  That's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the product's value while still allowing for a fair profit for me.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,600,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you be open to $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my acceptable price, it's still not high enough.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below the product's value.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,350,000 is still too low. To reach a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.
