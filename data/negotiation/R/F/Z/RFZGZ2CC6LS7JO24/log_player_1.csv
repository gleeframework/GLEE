Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,500,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible.
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 risks Bob rejecting the offer and forcing Alice to settle for $1,200,000 from John. 
* **Finding a Balance:** $1,400,000 leaves a significant profit margin for Bob, making it more likely he'll accept while still securing a substantial profit for Alice.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice has no way of knowing Bob's exact valuation beyond it being more than $1,200,000. In a real negotiation, factors like relationship dynamics, negotiation skills, and market urgency would also come into play."
