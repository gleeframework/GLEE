Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($150) creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $140 offer leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further, potentially allowing me to still sell above my minimum."
