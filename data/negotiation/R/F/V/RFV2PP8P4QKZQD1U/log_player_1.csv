"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll see what counter-offer he makes and adjust accordingly. I also keep in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's room for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge.  I'll need to make a counteroffer that's not too far off, but still leaves me with a decent profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering the price slightly from my initial offer, but still aiming for a significant profit.  This counteroffer shows flexibility while indicating that I'm not willing to accept Bob's initial offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up with a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has raised his offer to $1,100,000. This is a good price, considering my minimum is $1,000,000. I'm taking a calculated risk by accepting his offer, as I might be able to get a slightly higher price in the next round. However, there's always the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer or the negotiation dragging on. I'm prioritizing securing the deal at a profitable price and minimizing the risk of losing the sale to John or Bob dropping out."
