I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it's below my minimum threshold of $12,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired $14,000 to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial price. How about $13,500?  It's a fair compromise and closer to the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal and close enough to my minimum threshold.  I want to avoid the risk of further negotiations leading to a lower offer or losing the deal altogether."
