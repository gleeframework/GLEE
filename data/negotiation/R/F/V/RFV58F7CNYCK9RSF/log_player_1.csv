Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a very competitive price of $1,250,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its worth to you. I believe this offer is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering it's well below your valuation but still a significant profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $800,000 is far too low, and I can get more by negotiating with Bob or by selling to John.  I need to try and get closer to my desired price before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $950,000. This offer still provides you with a considerable profit, and allows me to achieve a more reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $1,000,000, but I'm still finding it hard to justify going that high. How about we settle on $875,000? This offer keeps us moving closer to a compromise and represents a substantial profit margin for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I need to keep pushing for a higher amount. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to $950,000 in the next round.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $925,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This offer still allows you to purchase the product at a price significantly below its value to you. Let's finalize this deal and make this mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I can see you're firm on your price, and I'm willing to increase my offer slightly. How about $900,000? This demonstrates my commitment to closing the deal while still securing a reasonable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe I can push for a slightly higher price.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to $925,000 in the next round.  However, if the next round doesn't result in a better offer, I'm going to seriously consider selling to John."
