Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" I aim to frame the product in a positive light, even if the initial price seems high.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My tone is polite and suggests I'm open to hearing Bob's perspective, which is important for a successful negotiation.

By starting high, I can potentially secure a deal closer to my desired outcome while having the safety net of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer but $1,900,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product but my budget is capped at $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to work with me on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is his perceived value, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John. I believe there's room for negotiation to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you sharing your perspective. While I understand your budget constraints, the value this product brings is substantial. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,700,000?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:** I've reduced my price by $200,000, which demonstrates flexibility. However, I remain significantly above both my minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's value to justify the higher price point. 
* **""Meet in the Middle""**: This phrasing suggests fairness and encourages Bob to make a similar move towards a compromise. 

This counteroffer keeps me in a strong negotiating position.  I'm willing to move closer to Bob's range, but only if he significantly increases his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,700,000 is still above my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we've both agreed on. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,400,000 is less than my ideal, but it's a significant improvement from his initial offer and above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate or Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a reasonable profit."
