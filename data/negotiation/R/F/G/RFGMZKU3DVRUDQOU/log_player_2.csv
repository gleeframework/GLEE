"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd pay $11,500 to Alice, which is less than the $12,000 you'd pay John.
* **You save money.** You get the product for a price lower than your maximum budget."
