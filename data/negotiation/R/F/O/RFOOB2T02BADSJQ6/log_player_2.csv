"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get it for even less. It's worth exploring further negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a better price than John's offer, Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible.  He can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice, given her willingness to lower the price from $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility in her pricing. $8,800 is significantly lower than John's offer of $12,000 and a good compromise considering Alice's initial price.  It's a fair deal for both parties, allowing Bob to save a good amount of money. There's a risk of continuing negotiations, but the potential savings may not be worth the gamble."
