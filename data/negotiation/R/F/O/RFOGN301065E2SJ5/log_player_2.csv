"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the previous round, it's still above Bob's target price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and Bob is close to his target price. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds increases.  Accepting the offer at $11,250 is a good compromise and secures the product for a reasonable price."
