"I'm excited to offer you the product for $15,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but $5,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice, but $10,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $7,000, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,500. It's a fair price that should meet both our needs.",9500.0,Alice,5,
