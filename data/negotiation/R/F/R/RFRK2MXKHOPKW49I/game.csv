"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $11,500. This is still a great deal considering its value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $9,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering both our positions.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand the pressure from John's offer, but I'm not willing to sell at $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $10,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product.",10750.0,Alice,7,
