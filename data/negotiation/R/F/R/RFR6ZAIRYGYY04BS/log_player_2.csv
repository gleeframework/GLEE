# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. While $16,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as she has shown a willingness to compromise."
