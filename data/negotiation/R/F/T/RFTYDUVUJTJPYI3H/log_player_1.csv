Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to try and get closer to my minimum price before considering selling to John."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's very close to my desired price and we're already four rounds in.  It's risky to keep negotiating and potentially end up with a lower offer, or worse, lose the deal entirely."
