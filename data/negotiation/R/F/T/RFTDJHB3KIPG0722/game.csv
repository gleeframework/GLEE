"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go for $110? ",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $110 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement. I'm happy to continue discussing it, but I'm really not comfortable going below $110.  If you're willing to go up to that, we can make this work. Otherwise, I may have to look at other options.",110.0,Alice,5,
