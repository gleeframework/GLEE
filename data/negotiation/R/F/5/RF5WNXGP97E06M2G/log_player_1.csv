Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation and maintains a perceived high value.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification of Value:** Highlighting a ""unique value proposition"" and potential for ""significant returns"" subtly justifies the high price without explicitly revealing your bottom line. 

**Goal:** This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob. If he rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John at your desired minimum."
