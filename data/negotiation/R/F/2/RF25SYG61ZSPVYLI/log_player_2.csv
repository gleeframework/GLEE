"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice since the product is worth $120 to you and $80 to her. There's room for a deal that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Alice has come down to $105, which is within your budget and a good deal compared to buying from John for $120.  It's worth accepting her offer."
