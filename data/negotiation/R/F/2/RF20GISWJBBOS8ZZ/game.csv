"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $17,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a deal we're both happy with.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand that $14,000 isn't quite your target. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about $15,500? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it still offers great value for you. ",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $15,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $15,250? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",15250.0,Bob,4,
