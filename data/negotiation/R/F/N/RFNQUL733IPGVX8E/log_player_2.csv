"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $15000. I know it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely useful.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking for a deal under $12,000, and Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand you have a budget, but $11000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product offers.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $13,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your target.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to go down to $12,500? This is a serious offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  $12500 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to make one last compromise. How about we split the difference and settle at $12750?  This is a final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still slightly above your budget, and you've already reached a point where further negotiation might take too long.  Buying from John for $12,000 guarantees you the product within your limit, and saves you the time and effort of more negotiation."
