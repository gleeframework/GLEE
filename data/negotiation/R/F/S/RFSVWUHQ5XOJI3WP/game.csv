"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to me is at least $1500000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer at $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $900000, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer at $950000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $980000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,

I'm counteroffering at $950000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm not willing to go any lower, as this is already a compromise for me.

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to counteroffer at $925000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price for this product.",925000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $972500. I'm willing to make a final offer, so I'd like to counteroffer at $920000. If this isn't acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away and consider buying the product from John for $1200000.",920000.0,Bob,10,
