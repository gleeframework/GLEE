Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still a bit above your budget of $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $825,000.  It's unlikely she'll budge further, and we have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000.  There's no point in risking further negotiation rounds."
