"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $9,500 falls quite short of what I can accept.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $11,750?
