```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* There's room for negotiation as the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, indicating a potential for a lower price.
* Buying from John at $1,000,000 is always an option, but it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal from Alice."

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000.
* There's still room for negotiation. Alice is willing to negotiate, and I can try to push for a lower price.
* Buying from John is always an option, but I want to see if I can secure a better deal with Alice first."

* I've already made my best counteroffer, and she's rejected it twice.
* Buying from John guarantees the product for my maximum budget, avoiding any further risk or negotiation."
