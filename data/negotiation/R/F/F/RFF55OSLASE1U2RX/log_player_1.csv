"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you first for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I want to start with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($150) to give myself room to negotiate down.  
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's valuation is significantly lower than mine.  This high starting price helps me gauge how interested he is and how flexible he might be. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have the security of John's offer ($150), so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Valuation:** Bob's offer of $120 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While his offer is low, it's a jump from his perceived value ($80), indicating he's willing to negotiate. Rejecting keeps the conversation going.
* **John as Backup:** I'm not in a rush.  Knowing John will buy the product for $150 gives me leverage to push for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can help move negotiations along. 
* **Above Minimum:**  The $160 price point is still comfortably above my $150 minimum and leaves some room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Testing the Waters:** I'm aiming to see how Bob reacts to a price closer to my range while still leaving myself options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to meet in the middle, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to try to find a compromise. How about we meet at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is small, and there's a risk that Bob might walk away.
* **Time Value:**  Securing the sale now at $140 is preferable to potentially dragging out negotiations and risking no deal with Bob."
