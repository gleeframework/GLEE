{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate if he counteroffers.  I'm also being optimistic and emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. I'm still above my minimum threshold, but it's a more reasonable price that might convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $97.5 is close to my minimum threshold, I'm choosing to sell to John for $100. I've been through several rounds of negotiation, and it's becoming clear that Bob might not be willing to pay what I'm asking. Selling to John is the fastest and surest way to secure a sale at my minimum price, which guarantees I won't lose money."
