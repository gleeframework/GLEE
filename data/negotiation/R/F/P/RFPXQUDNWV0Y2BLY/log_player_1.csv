"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price to see if Bob is interested. If he's not, I can lower the price in subsequent rounds. I'm also leaving the door open for negotiation, which could lead to a quicker deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $150 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $150 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $175. This still gives you a great deal on a fantastic product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise, and it's above my minimum price of $150. I'm happy to accept it and close the deal."
