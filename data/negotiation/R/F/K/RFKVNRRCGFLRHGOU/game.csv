"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am currently working within a tighter budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950000? I believe this would still provide a good return on investment for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a specific budget. While I appreciate your offer,  $950000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end and still allows for a substantial profit for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
