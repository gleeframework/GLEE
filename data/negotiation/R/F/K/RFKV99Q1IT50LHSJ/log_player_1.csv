Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you value greatly.  Given its significance, I propose a price of $925,000. This represents a fair deal recognizing its worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's potential for a price higher than John's offer.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering a price closer to Bob's valuation ($925,000) increases the chances of him accepting, maximizing potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while still ensuring a significant profit above the guaranteed offer from John."
