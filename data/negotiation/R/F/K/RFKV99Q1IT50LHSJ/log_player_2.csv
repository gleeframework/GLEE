"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you value greatly.  Given its significance, I propose a price of $925,000. This represents a fair deal recognizing its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can still save $75,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John.  

Since the goal is to save money, even a smaller saving is worth it."
