You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above your ideal target.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a better price.  You can see how low Alice is willing to go before resorting to buying from John."
