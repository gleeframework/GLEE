"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $15,000 to us. Given its high quality and unique features, we believe it would be worth $12,000 to you. To ensure a mutually beneficial transaction, I am proposing a price of $11,000 for the product. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her ($15,000), it's still above your maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, my budget for this purchase is $12,000.  I'm willing to pay that amount, which is still above your valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
