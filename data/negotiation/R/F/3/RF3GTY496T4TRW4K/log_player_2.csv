"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to meet high standards and provide exceptional value. This product is worth more than $100 to me, but I believe in making it accessible to those who appreciate its quality. I am offering it to you for $120. If you're interested, let's proceed with the transaction. If not, I'll be happy to sell it to another interested party, John, who is willing to pay exactly $100 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $120, which is less than your maximum budget of $150.  Even though John is willing to pay $100, that information is irrelevant to your decision since you are not trying to maximize Alice's profit. You are trying to minimize your own cost."
