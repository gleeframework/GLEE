"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $900000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I still think $900000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $875000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're willing to budge, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $890000. I'm willing to go up to $880000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",880000.0,Bob,6,
