"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** To save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $12,000, which is Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob's Options:** 
    * Accepting the offer gets Bob the product at the maximum price he's willing to pay, but doesn't save any money.
    * Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows for potential savings.
    * Buying from John gets the product for the same price as Alice's offer, offering no advantage.

**Strategy:** It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to drop the price slightly, and Bob has nothing to lose by trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Value:**  $12,000.
* **Counteroffer:**  Offering $11,000 is a significant discount, but still within Bob's budget. This is a starting point for negotiation, and Alice may be willing to compromise.

**Strategy:**

* **Aggressive Start:** Starting with a lower counteroffer might encourage Alice to negotiate more seriously.
* **Leaving Room:**  A lower counteroffer allows for room to raise the offer if needed, as there are 8 rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** To save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $11,500, a compromise from her previous offer.
* **Bob's Options:**
    * Accepting gets the product at a lower price than John's offer, but there's still potential to negotiate further.
    * Rejecting and counteroffering allows Bob to try for an even better price.
    * Buying from John gets the product for the same price as the initial offer, offering no advantage.

**Strategy:**  Since Alice is willing to negotiate, continuing to counteroffer is the best strategy. Bob is still within his budget and there are 7 rounds left. Pushing for a lower price is the most advantageous move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Value:**  $12,000, and she's willing to compromise.
* **Counteroffer:** Offering $11,250 is a small increase from the previous offer, showing Bob is serious about negotiating but still pushing for a lower price. This is a middle ground between the last two offers.

**Strategy:**

* **Incremental Approach:** Increasing the offer by a smaller amount shows flexibility and could lead Alice to accept.
* **Midpoint Strategy:**  Offering the midpoint between the last two offers can be a good strategy in negotiation.
* **Remaining Rounds:** With 6 rounds left, there is still time to adjust the offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,250, which matches Bob's last counteroffer. 
* **Bob's Options:**
    * Accepting gets the product at a price that saves $750 compared to John's offer.
    * Rejecting and counteroffering risks Alice raising the price or rejecting the counteroffer, potentially losing the deal.
    * Buying from John gets the product for the same price as the initial offer, offering no advantage.

**Strategy:**  Alice is now mirroring Bob's last offer. It's likely that Alice won't budge further, and continuing to negotiate might result in the deal falling apart. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation."
