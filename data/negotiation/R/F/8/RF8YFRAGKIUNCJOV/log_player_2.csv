This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You're nearing the halfway point:** You've successfully negotiated Alice down significantly from her initial offer. 
* **Alice is signaling a limit:** Her language suggests she's close to her lowest acceptable price.
* **Saving is good, but time matters:**  Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly lower price, but there's a risk Alice won't budge further, and you'll be running out of rounds. $765,000 is a very good deal compared to your $1,200,000 alternative."
