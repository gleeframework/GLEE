"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $12000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than $10,000,  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. Rejecting and counteroffering allows me to explore getting a higher price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm open to negotiation, $12,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, reflecting the value of the product and our continued discussion. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Based on my budget and the market value, I would like to propose a price of $12500. I hope we can reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to my desired price range.  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's  getting riskier to keep rejecting offers. Accepting now ensures a sale at a price significantly higher than selling to John."
