Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $150 as possible, but she also wants to avoid Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to accept anything less than $150.

By starting at $140, Alice increases her chances of selling to Bob at a price higher than his perceived value ($120) while still staying below her guaranteed sale price to John."
