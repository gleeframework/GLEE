"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,500. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum value of $15,000 without risking losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can get a better deal, especially since I have 8 rounds left.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to come up to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a $500 decrease from my initial offer, showing some flexibility but still leaving room for Bob to come up a little more.  Hopefully, this will be a more appealing price for Bob, and we can get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to accept it. I have more rounds to negotiate and I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $13,750. This is a compromise that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's last offer. I'm hoping that this shows a willingness to meet him halfway and that he'll be more likely to accept this price.  If not, we'll keep negotiating until we find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I still think I can get a slightly better deal. We only have 4 rounds left, so I need to be careful about how much I'm willing to concede. I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a small concession, but it shows that I'm willing to meet Bob halfway. We are running out of time, so I need to make a move that will get us closer to a deal. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are down to the wire and Bob is not willing to budge much further. While $13,250 is close to my minimum, I'm not comfortable taking the risk of him rejecting my next counteroffer.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and ending up with nothing.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
