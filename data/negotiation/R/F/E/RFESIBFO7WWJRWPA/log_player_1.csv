Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's still a bit above the market value, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price point with another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $92.50? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would ideally like to get closer to $100, I'm happy with $92.5.  It's significantly better than selling to John and puts me closer to my target. I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
