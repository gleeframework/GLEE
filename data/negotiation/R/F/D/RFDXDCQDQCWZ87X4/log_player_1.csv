Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in making a deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This is my top offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. $1,050,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,050,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to meet my own financial goals.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $1,025,000. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to try to get a slightly higher price from Bob.  While $1,000,000 is my fallback, I believe I can get closer to $1,100,000 with a counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm going to meet you halfway on your offer. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal now!"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

At this point, it's clear that Bob and I are too far apart in our valuations, and I don't want to risk losing too much time in further negotiations.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I get a solid price and don't lose out on a deal completely."
