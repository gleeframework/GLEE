"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in making a deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This is my top offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,050,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to meet my own financial goals.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $1,025,000. This is my best and final offer.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm going to meet you halfway on your offer. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal now!",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This is my best and final offer.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
