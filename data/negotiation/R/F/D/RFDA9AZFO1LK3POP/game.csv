"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle? I propose $1,400,000. This reflects the value I believe this product will bring to your business.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair and competitive price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
