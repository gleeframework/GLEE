"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I think it's worth $120 to you, considering how much you'll benefit from it. It's a steal at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still significantly higher than your $150 limit. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting her initial offer might lead to a better price."
