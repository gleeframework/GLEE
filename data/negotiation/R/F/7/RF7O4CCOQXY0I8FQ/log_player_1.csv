"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. It's a great deal, so let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $200 is more than I'm willing to spend. How about $100? I'm really interested in your product, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go that low.  I will counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $100 is just too low for me.  How about $175?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate.  $175 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference at $150.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no need to risk further negotiation, as selling to John at the same price would be equivalent.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
