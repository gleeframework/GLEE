,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $200 is more than I'm willing to spend. How about $100? I'm really interested in your product, but that's my limit.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $100 is just too low for me.  How about $175?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate.  $175 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference at $150.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
