"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $120 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $60? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting both the product's worth and my purchasing power.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $90 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
