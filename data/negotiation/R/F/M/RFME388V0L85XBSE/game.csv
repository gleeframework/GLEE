"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  However, $1,050,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're making compromises, and I appreciate that. How about we settle at $1,150,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,150,000 is still too far below what I need.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal happen.  Let me know if you're willing to go for it.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
