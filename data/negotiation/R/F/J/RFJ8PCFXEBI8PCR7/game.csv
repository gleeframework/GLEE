"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle again at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
