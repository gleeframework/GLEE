Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000 and it's not worth risking further negotiation.  It's time to secure the product for the guaranteed best price from John."
