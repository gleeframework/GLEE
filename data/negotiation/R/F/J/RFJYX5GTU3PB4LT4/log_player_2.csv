"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $60 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and there are more rounds available to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $60 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $50? "", ""product_price"": 50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** A $10 drop is a significant reduction but not so low that it seems unreasonable.  It shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a better deal.
* **Sets the stage:**  This counteroffer allows for further negotiation, and the message emphasizes Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 50 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 55? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Alice has already dropped her price from $60 to $55. This shows a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Good Deal:**  $55 is a significant saving from Bob's initial budget of $80 and a good compromise.
* **No Need to Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or the deal could fall apart.  It's safer to take the good deal now."
