(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far above his budget.  He should counteroffer and try to get closer to his desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. He should reject and make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $10,000 or even lower."
