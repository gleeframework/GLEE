"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I can still make a reasonable profit. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
