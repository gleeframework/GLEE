"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I have to consider the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's work towards a deal that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $1,250,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can seal the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a little above my target.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is my final offer.  Let's see if we can strike a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your target, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,200,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I believe this is the minimum I can accept. I'm willing to meet you at the midpoint of our last two offers, which is $1,200,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this point.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
