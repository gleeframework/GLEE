"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the market value, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $900000. However, I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique features.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $950000.

This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's unique features.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go down to $980000, but I think that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",980000.0,Bob,6,
