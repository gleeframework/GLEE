"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd love to get it for a bit lower than that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I understand your position, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This reflects the value it would bring you while still being a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $10,800. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm thinking $10,400. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm really hoping we can make a deal.",10400.0,Bob,6,
