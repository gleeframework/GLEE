I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Maximize Profit:** By offering a higher price, I increase the potential for a larger profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Limited Risk:** Even if Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000, which is still a favorable outcome.
* **Negotiation Room:**  This offer gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price. 

I believe this strategy balances maximizing potential earnings with minimizing risk."
