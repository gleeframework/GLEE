"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I think it would be a great asset to you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it."", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This low offer will help me gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a backup option at $8,000, so I'm not desperate to accept any offer from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", 
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up, But Strategically:** I increased my offer significantly to show Alice I'm serious, but I'm still aiming to stay well below her $10,000 value.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** $7,500 is a reasonable jump from my previous offer and puts us closer to a potential agreement point. 
* **Time Constraint:** I'm aware that we have limited rounds, so I need to start moving closer to a price that might work for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $7,500. This product is truly worth more. Would you be willing to meet closer to my previous offer at $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice is coming down, but $9,500 is still above my $8,000 maximum and what I can get it for from John.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  We're getting closer, but there's still room for Alice to lower her price, especially knowing I have an alternative option.
* **Strategic Pressure:** By rejecting this offer, I signal to Alice that I'm willing to walk away if the price doesn't meet my needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,500 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $8,250? That's a significant increase on my end, and I'm really trying to make this work."", 
""product_price"": 8250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget, But Strategic:** I'm offering slightly above my $8,000 budget, signaling to Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal but need her to meet me part way. 
* **Justifying the Offer:** By mentioning it's a ""significant increase,"" I emphasize that I'm being flexible and trying to find a solution.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation, and I want to secure the deal before I have to go to John."
