Bob should reject the offer.  While it's a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $13,000. How about $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a good price for Bob.  It's within his budget and a good deal.  There's no guarantee that a further counteroffer will be successful, so accepting is the best option."
