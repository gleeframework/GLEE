{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, making the offer seem more attractive.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to counter-offer and start a dialogue.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and begin the negotiation process. By starting high, I maintain leverage while still giving Bob a reason to consider the offer.  I'm prepared to counter-offer if needed, and always have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I am still looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).** Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me. 
* **I have a strong backup option:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.  I'll use this opportunity to counter-offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to reach a compromise with Bob while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $1,350,000?  This price reflects the value of the product for you while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's value for Bob to make my price seem more reasonable.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage further negotiation and keep the dialogue going.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* Signal my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profitable price.
* Encourage Bob to consider a higher price.
* Keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually agreeable outcome.

I'm prepared to adjust my counteroffer further based on Bob's response, but I'll remain firm on my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. The option to sell to John for that price provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I'm not comfortable with $1,350,000, I'd like to make one last attempt at a compromise. I propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable price for the product while leaving some room for your profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).** Accepting it would mean a loss of $200,000.
* **I have a secure alternative:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price.

**Strategy:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'll reject his offer and make a final counteroffer. I'm prepared to make a small concession but will not go below my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects my final offer, I'll sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to make one final concession to reach a deal. Let's settle on $1,450,000. This is a price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value for you.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you accept."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and making Bob feel like this is the last chance to reach a deal.
* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I reiterate the value of the product for Bob, framing the price as fair.
* **Clear Decision Point:**  I'm ending with a clear question, forcing Bob to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

This final counteroffer aims to:

*  Put pressure on Bob to accept the deal.
*  Secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
*  Force a final decision, as further negotiation could lead to a sale to John.

I'm now prepared to sell to John for my minimum price if Bob rejects this offer. This strategy maximizes my chances of getting the best possible price while leaving the door open for a deal with Bob."
