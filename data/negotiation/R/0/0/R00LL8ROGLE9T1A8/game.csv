"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I am still looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $1,350,000?  This price reflects the value of the product for you while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I'm not comfortable with $1,350,000, I'd like to make one last attempt at a compromise. I propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable price for the product while leaving some room for your profit margin.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value for you.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you accept.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
