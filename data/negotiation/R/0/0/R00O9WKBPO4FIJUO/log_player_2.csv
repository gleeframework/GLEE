Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This would be a great deal for you and would still allow me to make a reasonable profit.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a price that's more reasonable for me. How about $950,000?"", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?
