"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a fair price considering the market value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I have 8 rounds left and can potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This would be a great deal for you and would still allow me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a price that's more reasonable for me. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $1,000,000. I have 6 rounds left to potentially get a better price from Bob or I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to pay $925,000, which is closer to my original target. I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $925,000 is still below my minimum value and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to guarantee the sale to John for $1,000,000 than risk further negotiation with Bob that might not lead to a better price."
