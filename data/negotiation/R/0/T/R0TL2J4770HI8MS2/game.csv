"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, as it's a significant discount from the market value. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $10,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the discount I'm offering. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference - how about $11,000?  This would be a great deal for both of us and allow us to close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable going below $12,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price again.  While $11,750 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,250 as a final price?  I believe this is a fair deal for both of us and would allow us to finalize the sale.",11250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not comfortable going below $12,200. I'll make one more concession: I'll meet you at $11,800. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",11800.0,Alice,7,
