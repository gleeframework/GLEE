"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's a great deal for both of us.  I know you're interested, and I'm confident this will be a win-win. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, so $12,000 is acceptable.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $3,000 compared to buying from John."
