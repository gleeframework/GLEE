"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to pay $120."
