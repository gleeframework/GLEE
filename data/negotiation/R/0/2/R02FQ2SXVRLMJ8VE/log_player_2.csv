"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to me, so I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While buying from John for $8,000 is always an option, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first. Alice's initial offer is $1,000 above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the chance to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
