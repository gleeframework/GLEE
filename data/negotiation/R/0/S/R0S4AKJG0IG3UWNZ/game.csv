"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which I think is a fair price.  What do you say?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $130.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.  What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm really only comfortable paying $100.  I'm happy to buy it at that price, but I'm not going to go any higher.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll just go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
