I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and still significantly higher than selling to John.  I'm confident I can make a good profit with this deal."
