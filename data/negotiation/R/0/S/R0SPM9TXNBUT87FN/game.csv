"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $850,000 undervalues its potential.  I could consider $925,000 â€“ I believe that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you believe in the value of this product, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
