"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $950,000 is a decent starting point, but Bob can likely get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and hopefully get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $850,000 undervalues its potential.  I could consider $925,000 â€“ I believe that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal. Bob is looking to save as much money as possible and should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you believe in the value of this product, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
