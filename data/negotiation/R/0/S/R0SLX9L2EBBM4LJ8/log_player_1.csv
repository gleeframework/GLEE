Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer a price significantly lower than $150 to entice him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I start high, the ""limited time"" and ""special price"" phrasing suggests there might be some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between attracting Bob and securing a price close to my minimum."
