{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit. I'm confident I can get at least $120 for the product, but I'm hoping to get a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell at a loss. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm confident you'll be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a price that's a bit closer to my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you at $118. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is still below my initial target, it's only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm choosing to accept his offer, as I'm comfortable selling for this price and continuing the negotiation could risk losing the sale altogether."
