Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob is interested in this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it.  $7,000 is below my minimum value, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough to encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's above my minimum value and closer to my desired price.  Further negotiation might get me a bit more, but the risk of losing the deal to John at $8,000 is too high.  I'll take the $8,500."
