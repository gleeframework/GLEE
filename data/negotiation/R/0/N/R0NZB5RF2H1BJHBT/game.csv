"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a great price for a product of this value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000, which is the price I was initially willing to pay for the product from John. I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
