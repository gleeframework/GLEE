,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I really appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my value. Let's see if we can make this work.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",90.0,Bob,4,
