Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you a chance to make some profit while still being flexible.

If Bob rejects, you can then adjust your counter-offer based on his response. Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I really appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  You have a better option:  John is willing to pay your minimum. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Maintain your bargaining power:**  Show Bob that you're not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Explore a counter-offer:** You can use this opportunity to negotiate a price closer to your target.

**Important Note:** If Bob makes further counteroffers that are still below your minimum price, you should always choose to sell to John to avoid taking a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my value. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This offer is higher than Bob's last offer but still lower than your minimum.  
* **Compromise:** It shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting your profit margin.
* **Reasoning:**  You're providing a clear explanation for your offer, making it more likely Bob will consider it seriously.

This counter-offer is a balanced approach.  It allows you to continue negotiations without immediately resorting to selling to John. It also keeps the pressure on Bob to come up with a better offer if he wants to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum.  

Here's why selling to John is the best decision:

* **Guaranteed profit:**  You'll earn $120, meeting your minimum profit requirement.
* **No further negotiations:**  You avoid the risk of Bob further lowering his offer, potentially resulting in a loss for you.
* **Time efficiency:**  You can finalize the sale quickly and move on to other opportunities.

While it's tempting to try to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob,  the risk of ending up with a lower price than John's offer is too high. Selling to John is the most secure and profitable option at this point."
