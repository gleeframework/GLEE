# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer. $100 is more than your limit, and you can get the product from John for $80."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my value. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial price, it's still more than your maximum of $80. It's worth trying to negotiate further, or going with John."
