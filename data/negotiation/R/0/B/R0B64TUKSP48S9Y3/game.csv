"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $15,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $10,000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $13,500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a little more than I can comfortably afford right now.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000? That's a significant step closer to your price and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
