"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $78 for the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $78 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $84. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",84.0,Alice,5,
