Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a better price than $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit lower. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $108. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings!

Alice has lowered her price to $108, which is within Bob's budget of $120 and is a good compromise. Accepting the offer saves Bob $12 compared to buying from John, achieving his goal of saving money."
