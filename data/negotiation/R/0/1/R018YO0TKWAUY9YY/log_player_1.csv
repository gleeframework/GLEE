Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000.  Would that work for you?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

While I value your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?

While Bob's offer is closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll budge much beyond this point. Taking the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John makes more sense than potentially drawing out negotiations with Bob for a smaller increase."
