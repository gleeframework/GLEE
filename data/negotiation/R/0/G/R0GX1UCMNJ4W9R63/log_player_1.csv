Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a high price for the product.  If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his valuation and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  While I'm willing to consider a lower price, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, it's not worth risking further negotiation at this point.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and guarantees my minimum desired profit."
