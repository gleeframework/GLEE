Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product.  She has a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This means he wouldn't rationally pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  There's a potential profit margin for Alice if she can sell to Bob for more than her bottom line but less than his maximum valuation.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Targeting the Sweet Spot:** The offered price of $1,350,000 falls between Bob's valuation and Alice's minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:** Alice's message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to subtly appeal to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong starting point, Alice could potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob pushes back, but she shouldn't go below $1,500,000.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice is confident in John's willingness to buy at $1,500,000. If there's any risk John might back out, Alice might need to adjust her approach to be more aggressive in securing a deal with Bob."
