"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $13,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to negotiate. ",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I need a little more to make this work. How about $13,250? It's a small compromise from my previous offer, and it's still a great price for you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. ",13250.0,Alice,5,
