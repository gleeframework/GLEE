Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first.  I think it would be a great asset to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your minimum ($12,000) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) gives you the best chance of maximizing profit.
* **First Refusal:** Highlighting that you're offering it to Bob first creates a sense of exclusivity and might encourage him to consider it more seriously. 

**Important:**  This assumes you have no significant costs for delaying the sale to John. If time is a factor, you might lower the price slightly to increase the chance of a quick sale to Bob."
