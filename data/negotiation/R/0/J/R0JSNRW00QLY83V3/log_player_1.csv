""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  Let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $1,500,000 is a tempting offer, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I'm still hesitant to pay $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and getting closer to a price point that could be acceptable.  While his ""final offer"" language might be a tactic, it's worth seeing if we can push a bit higher before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting close. I respect your position and willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value while working for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,900,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to push him a bit further. If he's unwilling to budge past $1,700,000, I'll likely accept in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's make this final push â€“ $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for this valuable product.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to draw a line in the sand. Bob is very close to my walk-away point. This offer signals firmness while still leaving the door open for a deal. If he rejects this, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've already offered $1,700,000 in round 6, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at this price, so I'll stick to my previous offer of $1,700,000. I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $1,700,000. While it's not ideal, it's still a significant profit above my absolute minimum. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob walking away and having to settle for John's offer of $1,500,000."
