"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a better deal than John's offer, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still above Bob's target price of $800,000.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially get a lower price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob could potentially reach his target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer you $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $920000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest counteroffer of $920,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While Bob has been successful in lowering the price through negotiation, it seems Alice is unlikely to go lower. Given this, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation that might not yield a better result."
