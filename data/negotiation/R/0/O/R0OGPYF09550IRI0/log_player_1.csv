Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested in discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and Bob's expertise creates a perceived higher worth.
* **Open to discussion:**  The message encourages a dialogue, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price above Alice's minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's risk tolerance:**  It's unknown how likely Bob is to reject a high offer. A more aggressive starting price might cause him to walk away.
* **Time sensitivity:**  If Alice is under time pressure to sell, a lower, more immediately appealing offer might be wiser. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
