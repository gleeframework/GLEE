Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts, as I'm eager to see this product reach its full potential."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I'm in a strong position to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** By emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""incredible value,"" I aim to influence Bob's perception of the product's worth. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I start high at $1,500,000, the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. This allows me to potentially secure a price well above my minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can be persuasive in negotiations."
