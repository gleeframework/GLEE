You're still closer to your target price of $120 if you buy from John, so keep negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:

Alice is now asking $108, which is closer to your maximum budget of $120. However, you've already reached a point where negotiating further with Alice is unlikely to get you a better price. It's better to buy the product from John for $120, as this is within your budget and guarantees you get the product."
