Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, at least $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe its value to you will be substantial. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than $1,000,000, I think I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. I have nine rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still aiming for something closer to my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? This would give you a significant price advantage while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? That way, I can get a good deal and you can still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,250,000 is tempting, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. We're only on round 4, and I have six more rounds to try and get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but we're getting closer.  $1,300,000 is a fair compromise and still allows you to secure a valuable product at a good price. I'm confident you'll find this investment pays off in the long run."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $1250000 again? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this investment, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

It's down to the wire. While $1,250,000 is a good price,  I'm running out of time and negotiating rounds. To guarantee a sale and avoid the risk of ending up with nothing,  I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
