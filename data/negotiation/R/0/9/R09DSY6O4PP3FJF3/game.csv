"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, at least $1000000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe its value to you will be substantial. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1200000 is a good starting point, but I'm still aiming for something closer to my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and go with $1350000? This would give you a significant price advantage while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
