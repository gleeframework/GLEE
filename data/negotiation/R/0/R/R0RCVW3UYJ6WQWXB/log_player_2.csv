"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your company. I'm confident it's worth at least $800000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This price reflects the product's potential and the value it can bring to your business. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price, and you don't know the product's value to her. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the potential of this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This price still reflects the value I see in the product while allowing us both a reasonable margin. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit lower than what I believe the product is truly worth. Considering its potential value and the market demand, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it still offers you a significant return on your investment. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,000,000, which is still within my budget. It's likely that Alice is still willing to negotiate, but the risk of her raising the price again is real. Accepting her offer secures a good deal and avoids the potential for further negotiation."
