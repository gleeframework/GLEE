"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$950,000 is a good price, but there's room to negotiate.  It's likely Alice is willing to go lower, and I can potentially save more money by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer,  reducing the price by $150,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if she's not flexible.  While this might seem like a large reduction, it's still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my counteroffer.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not yet ready to accept her offer.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $850,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but still want a good deal. It's a reasonable middle ground between my previous offer and her current offer, and I believe it increases the chances of her accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  It's worth risking another round of negotiation to try and squeeze out a bit more savings.  I'm willing to walk away if necessary, but I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $875,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway. It's a reasonable step up from my previous offer and might be appealing to her.  I'm trying to find a price where she's willing to sell and I'm still getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd love to get it lower, $880,000 is a good price considering we're approaching the halfway point of our negotiation rounds.  If I keep rejecting, I risk Alice getting frustrated and walking away or her increasing the price again. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good deal and avoid having to buy from John at a much higher price."
