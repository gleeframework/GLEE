"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should continue negotiating to try to get a lower price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I need to stay within that budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,500. This is a fair price, and it's the closest I can come to your offer while still ensuring I get a reasonable price.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is closer to his budget, he can still potentially negotiate a lower price.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice to come down to $9,000 or even a little lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $9,250.  This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, and I appreciate your continued interest. I'm willing to go down to $9,400. This is the very last compromise I can make, as it's still a considerable distance from your initial offer. Let's try to seal this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting very close to Bob's offer, but it seems like she is unwilling to go any lower.  Bob is still $400 above his maximum budget.  At this point, it's better to buy from John for $8,000, as there's a strong chance that further negotiation with Alice will not result in a better price.  It's more advantageous to secure the product at his target price and move on."
