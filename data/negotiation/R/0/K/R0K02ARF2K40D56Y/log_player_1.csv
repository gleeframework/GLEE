"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to maximize my profits, so I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80). 
* **Reasonable offer:**  $120 is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $150 to him.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm being polite and encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?  I'm really interested in the product and think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** While $100 is a good deal, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps me in the driver's seat and allows me to control the negotiation.
* **No immediate need:** I'm not under pressure to sell right now, so I can afford to be patient and see if I can get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $110?  That's still a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away too much. 
* **Mid-point:**  $110 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, subtly suggesting that he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $110 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $105? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on the goal:** $105 is very close to my desired profit margin and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance that he'll become less interested or that further negotiations will drag on, potentially leading to a lower price or a sale to John.
* **Time constraint:** We are approaching the middle of the negotiation rounds, and I want to ensure a sale before time runs out.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good price while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
