"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's starting offer is much too high. It's important to negotiate down towards your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit out of my price range. Would you consider something closer to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with an offer considerably lower than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining. 
* **Target in Mind:** While I'm aiming for a price under $80, starting at $60 allows Alice to potentially counter within a range I find acceptable.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is polite but clearly communicates my price expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my acceptable price, but I'm not in a rush. John's offer of $80 is still better, so I have leverage.  I'll try negotiating one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($85) and my previous one ($65). It shows willingness to compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I've added language suggesting I'm ready to close the deal if she accepts, which might make her more receptive. 
* **Staying Below John's Price:** I'm still aiming for a better deal than John's $80 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to go to $75 yet. How about we try $92? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not negotiating in good faith. Her latest offer of $92 is a step backward and further from my price range than before. It seems unlikely she'll come down to a price I'm willing to pay.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $80."
