"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

It's always best to start by negotiating.  Alice's offer is above your budget, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best first step."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me, and it allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a reasonable compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Alice's offer is still a bit high. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too much for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while still giving you a profit."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

I'm offering the product to you for $10,750. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750.
