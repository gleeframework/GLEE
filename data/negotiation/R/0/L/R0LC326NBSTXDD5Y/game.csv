"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1,200,000. This price still allows me to recognize the product's worth while staying within my financial limits.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand the value you see in the product, I must adhere to my budget. I am willing to increase my counteroffer to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to consider the product's worth while remaining within my financial limits.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,600,000 is still a bit low for me to accept.  My final offer is $1,725,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and reflects my willingness to find a compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",1725000.0,Alice,5,
