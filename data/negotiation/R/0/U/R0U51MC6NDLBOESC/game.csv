"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium.

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm happy to go up to $10,750, which is a fair compromise.  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll be happy with the product.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,750 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and sell it to you for $10,900. It's a good price for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",10900.0,Alice,5,
