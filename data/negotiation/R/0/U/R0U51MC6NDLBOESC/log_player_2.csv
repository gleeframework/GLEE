"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob can do better than $11,500. He's willing to pay up to $12,000, so there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $11,000 is better than $11,500, he can still try to get closer to his target of $10,500.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation going."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,750 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and sell it to you for $10,900. It's a good price for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's goal was to get the product for less than $12,000. Alice's offer of $10,900 is within his budget and a good deal considering John's price of $12,000.  It's likely Alice won't go lower, so Bob should accept the offer and secure the product."
