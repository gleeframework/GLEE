"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice's offer of $90 is better than John's offer of $100, but you can still do better.  Since you can get the product from John for $100, you should reject Alice's offer and see if she will lower the price."
