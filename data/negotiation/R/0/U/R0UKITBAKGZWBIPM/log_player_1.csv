Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to let it go for $14,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. 
* **John as a Back-up:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Offering the product at $14,500 leaves room for negotiation while aiming significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's reaction, further negotiation might be necessary."
