Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value.  I'm asking $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to Bob, hoping to make him more willing to pay a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message is friendly and open to negotiation, making Bob feel like he can counteroffer without feeling like he's being unreasonable. 
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can use the threat of selling to John for $80 as leverage during the counteroffer stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $90. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close:** Bob's offer of $90 is only $10 less than my initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely.  
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit of $10, which is more than I would get from selling to John.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could drag things out, and I'd rather secure a sale and move on."
