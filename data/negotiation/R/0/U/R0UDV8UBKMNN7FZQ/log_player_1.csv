"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob, given his perceived value of $80.
* **Positive tone:** A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for negotiation:** By starting high, I leave room for negotiation and potential compromise. 
* **Focus on value:** I highlight the product's potential value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.

This first offer sets the stage for negotiation, allowing me to see Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum of $150. 
* **Room for compromise:**  While Bob's offer is low, it does indicate his interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation and show that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming for a compromise that is both acceptable to Bob and profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his. 
* **Maintaining profit:** $160 is still above my minimum of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive and encouraging:** I use a positive tone to maintain a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Reiterating value:** I remind Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to consider my offer.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties and hopefully leads to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $160. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $140. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $140 is still below my $150 threshold.  
* **John is a secure option:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees my minimum profit and eliminates further negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to see if he's willing to come up further.

**Next Steps:**  I will consider a counteroffer, but I'll also seriously weigh the option of selling to John as a safe alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to make one final adjustment.  $145 is my absolute lowest.  This is still a great deal for a product of this quality, and it's the closest I can come to your offer.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering a price just above my minimum, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profitable margin.
* **Framing it positively:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" and the quality of the product to motivate Bob.
* **Clarity and urgency:** I make it clear that this is my final offer, putting some pressure on Bob to make a decision. 

**Next Steps:** I'm willing to accept $145, but I'll be watching closely for Bob's reaction. If he rejects, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $130 is significantly below my minimum of $150.
* **John is a safe alternative:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Limited time and value:** With only 4 rounds left, the chance of Bob increasing his offer significantly is low, especially since he's already rejected my final compromise. 

**It's time to secure my profit and move on. John offers a guaranteed and acceptable price.**"
