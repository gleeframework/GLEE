I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not at my minimum. I believe I can continue to negotiate with Bob and get a better price.  We have a lot of rounds left, and I'm not ready to give up just yet."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I understand he's dug in at $900,000, but I'm still not at my minimum. While I'm starting to feel pressure, I'm going to see if I can get him to budge.  We have a few rounds left, and I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my desired price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,200,000.  While I'm disappointed I couldn't get a better price from Bob, it's clear he's dug in at $900,000.  We only have two rounds left, and I'm not confident I can get him to budge any further.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the best option for me at this point."
