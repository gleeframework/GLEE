"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $650,000. I'm confident that you'll find this price reasonable considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the starting point, that price is a bit too low for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. I believe this price is still a great deal for both of us.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $700,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit high for me. How about $600,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is still a bit higher than your target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $675,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,5,
