Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $95 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($80) to give myself room to negotiate. I'm also keeping it lower than the product's worth to Bob ($100), hoping to find a middle ground that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum ($80), it's still below what I'd prefer. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate the offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $70 was probably a bit low.  How about we meet in the middle at $77? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, it's still not high enough. I'd rather not risk further negotiation and lose more time.  Selling to John for $80 guarantees me a decent profit, and it's a better choice than potentially ending up with a lower offer from Bob."
