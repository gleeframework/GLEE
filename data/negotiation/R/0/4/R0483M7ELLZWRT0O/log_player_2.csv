"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible. $90 is a good price, but you can likely get it lower.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $75? "", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**  Offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price shows you're serious about negotiating.  $75 is a reasonable starting point, as it's still a good deal for you, but also leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $82? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down from her original price, and $82 is still within your budget and a good deal.  You're unlikely to get a much lower price from Alice, and it's not worth risking another round of negotiation to potentially save a few dollars when you could be buying the product now."
