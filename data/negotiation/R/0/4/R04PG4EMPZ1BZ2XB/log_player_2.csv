# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
