"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within your budget, it's still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for further negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down to a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $105, which is within your budget and a good price considering your goal is to save money. Accepting the offer allows you to buy the product while still staying under your $120 limit. Further negotiation could potentially save a few more dollars, but the risk of losing the deal altogether and having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it at this point."
