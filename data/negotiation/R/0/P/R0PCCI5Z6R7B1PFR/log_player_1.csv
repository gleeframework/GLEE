Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could lead to a quicker sale and still net a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $14,000 is a strong offer. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.
* **Alternative in Mind:** By setting the price at $14,000, I acknowledge there's a chance Bob might decline. However, I'm comfortable with this risk because I have John as a backup buyer."
