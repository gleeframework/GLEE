"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price given the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $975,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on it.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900,000. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering you the product for $925,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product and the value I place on it.",925000.0,Alice,5,
