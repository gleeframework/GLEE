"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $7,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500? That's the highest I can go.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $8,500 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find common ground.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find common ground, but I'm afraid $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one final offer: $8,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",8000.0,Bob,6,
