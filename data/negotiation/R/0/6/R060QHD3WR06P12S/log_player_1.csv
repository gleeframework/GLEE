I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. It's too low for the value of the product to me. I'm willing to negotiate further but need to see if Bob is willing to raise his offer."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what John is offering, I'm still not willing to settle for that price. I believe I can get a better deal with Bob, and I want to see if he's truly serious about buying the product.  I'm going to continue negotiating."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While Bob's offer is getting closer, we're running out of time. It's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees me a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
