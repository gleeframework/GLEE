Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above your minimum ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the value of the product to Bob. This approach balances maximizing profit with keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $9,500 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below the midpoint of your ideal price and Bob's perceived value. This suggests there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for $9,500.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,750.  This price still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired selling point."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to propose a price of $9,600 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,600 is only $100 less than your counteroffer and is very close to your ideal selling point. It's a good compromise, and it's more than what you would get from John."
