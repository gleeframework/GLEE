"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your initial offer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant and well above $800,000. To move towards a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $900,000, which represents a substantial investment on my part. Let's bridge the gap and make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
