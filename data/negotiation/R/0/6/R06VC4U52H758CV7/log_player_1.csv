Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $900,000, which represents a substantial investment on my part. Let's bridge the gap and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, the increments are too small to close the gap in a reasonable number of rounds. We are still significantly below our minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John guarantees our desired profit immediately."
