{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also indicates a willingness to compromise, potentially leading to a quicker deal.  

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth pursuing further negotiation with him or if it's better to simply sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too far off the mark.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand this is a valuable product, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good compromise. It's close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and it's likely that I won't get a better offer from him.  While I'd prefer to sell to John for $12,000, accepting Bob's offer is a reasonable and profitable outcome."
