"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $1000000 for this purchase. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to consider the value of the product as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
