You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice's offer is above your maximum price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $780,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $820,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, it's still above my maximum price.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
