"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but my ownership comes with significant inherent value that justifies a higher price.  To keep this moving, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the product's true worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still far beyond my budget. To be frank, I'm considering other options closer to $700,000. If you're able to make a more realistic offer, I'm still interested. Otherwise, I might have to explore those alternatives.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty. It seems we're still quite far apart in our valuations. I've done a lot of analysis on what this product can do, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns beyond what you're currently considering.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,700,000.  However, this is my final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
