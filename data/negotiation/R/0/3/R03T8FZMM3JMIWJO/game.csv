"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you consider this offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
