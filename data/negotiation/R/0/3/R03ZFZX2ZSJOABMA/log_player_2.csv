Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to what I need, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go down to $925,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a profit on this product. While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? This would allow us both to walk away happy. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  I've already negotiated for 6 rounds and haven't been able to get the price down to a level I'm comfortable with.  To avoid further delays and ensure I get the product within my budget, I'm going to purchase it from John for $800,000."
