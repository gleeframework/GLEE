Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's start there and see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
