Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $110 is higher than Bob's $80 valuation, giving you some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  $110 is still above your minimum of $120, meaning you'll make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can potentially negotiate a higher price if Bob is interested.

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth my time or if I should just sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price.  John is a guaranteed $120, so I need to make sure any deal with Bob is at least as good."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still above your offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  $105 is a step up from $95, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **It's below my initial offer:**  I'm lowering my price from $110, showing flexibility.
* **It's still above my minimum:**  $105 is still above my minimum of $120, meaning I'll still make a profit.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
