Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I know this product is valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000. Offering it for less than $10,000 is a waste, and offering it for exactly $10,000 doesn't leave Alice with any extra profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, Bob could counter-offer. Starting at $11,500 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000. This knowledge gives Alice a strong position."
