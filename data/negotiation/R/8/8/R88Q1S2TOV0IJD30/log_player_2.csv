# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know you value highly, and I'm confident it would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a good profit while still giving you a significant advantage. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.
