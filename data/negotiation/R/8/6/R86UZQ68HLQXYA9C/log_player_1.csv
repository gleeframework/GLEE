Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it would be of great value to you."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $100. By offering it at $90, we aim to capture the majority of the potential profit while still ensuring a deal that's attractive to him.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $90 is our target, starting slightly higher leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer. This keeps the door open for a slightly higher sale price.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $80 provides a safety net.  If Bob rejects the offer, we still have a guaranteed sale at our minimum acceptable price."
