"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  It's a fair price that respects both our needs. Let's make this happen!",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $11,500, so I'm thinking $12,000 is a fair price. I'm getting close to considering buying from John at this point, though.",12000.0,Bob,6,
