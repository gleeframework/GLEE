Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $900,000 is still pushing my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?  That's a substantial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob, potentially ending up with a lower offer, or having the negotiation fail altogether.  Selling to John ensures we get our minimum acceptable price."
