"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

This counter-offer accomplishes the following:

* **Polite & Professional:** Maintains a positive tone with Alice.
* **Significant Counter:** Starts with a much lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility.  
* **Within Budget:**  Keeps the offer comfortably below your $800,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $900,000 is still above your budget and John's offer. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $900,000 is still pushing my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?  That's a substantial offer."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Acknowledging Value:** You're showing Alice you recognize the product's worth, which can help in negotiations.
* **Budget Constraint:** Reiterate that your budget is a limiting factor. 
* **Strong Counter:**  $700,000 is a significant jump from your previous offer, showing you're willing to move closer to her price. It also keeps you below John's offer with room to negotiate."
