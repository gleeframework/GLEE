"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $900,000 is still pushing my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?  That's a substantial offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
