Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product sits significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer represents a significant discount on your initial valuation and a fair deal for both of us.
