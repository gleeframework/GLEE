I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'm still aiming for a higher price than $8,800. I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."

Round 3

``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to what I want, and we're already at round 4. It's better to secure a deal than to risk losing him and having to settle for John's offer."
