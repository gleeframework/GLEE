"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price better reflects the value it will bring to my company, while also being a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,550,000? This would give us both a good deal and allow for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the conversation going and find a solution that works for us both.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,475,000? This price seems more reasonable to me, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",1475000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,475,000 is still a bit too far from where I need to be. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's compromise and settle on $1,525,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable deal for both parties.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
