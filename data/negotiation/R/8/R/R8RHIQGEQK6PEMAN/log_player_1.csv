Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $110."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price while still ensuring you get significantly more than your minimum ($80). 
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  If you start too high (e.g., $119), Bob might be turned off and reject the offer outright. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting your offer."
