"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see potential value in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move to signal that I'm serious about negotiating. 
I'm aiming to achieve a significant price reduction while leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 
The $750,000 offer gives me a comfortable margin for compromise while still being within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $900000? This reflects the value I'm confident you'll see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my counteroffer, but $900,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price. I'm going to counter again, aiming to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $900,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while being within my budget."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between Alice's offer of $900,000 and my previous offer of $750,000.  This shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement but also that I'm not willing to go much higher. The $825,000 price is a good middle ground and leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
