{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $950,000, leaving room for negotiation but still significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the potential profit for Bob to incentivize him. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, encouraging a dialogue.
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **John is a better option:**  Selling to John guarantees a higher price and avoids further negotiation.
* **Counteroffer is possible:** I can counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, but I'm not willing to risk accepting such a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still gives you a great deal, and allows us to make this happen.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower price:**  I'm lowering my price from the initial $950,000 to $850,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value for Bob:**  I'm emphasizing the fact that even at $850,000, Bob is still getting a good deal.
* **Room for more negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant.  However, it's still significantly above his initial offer, showing I'm not desperate.
* **Maintaining John as backup:** I still have John as a backup buyer, which allows me to walk away if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $720,000? That's a significant increase on my last offer and a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's an improvement from his previous offer, $720,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **John offers a much better deal:**  Selling to John guarantees a significantly higher price, ensuring I get the value I want for my product.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful:**  Bob has clearly set his budget, and further negotiation might lead to a lower price than his current offer, which is not acceptable.

**Conclusion:**  Given the potential to sell to John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to end the negotiation with Bob and secure the higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $720,000 is still below my minimum.  To be fair, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $785,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a slight decrease:**  I'm lowering my price from $850,000 to $785,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer, demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting the value for Bob:**  I'm emphasizing that $785,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering the product's value.
* **Final negotiation:**  This counteroffer allows for one final negotiation round before I decide to sell to John.  It's a last attempt to get a price closer to my desired range."
