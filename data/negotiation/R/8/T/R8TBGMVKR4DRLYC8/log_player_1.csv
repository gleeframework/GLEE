"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is truly interested.  It's a risky move, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is a good price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still below $10,000.  I want to see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a little more.  I'll counter with a price just above his last offer. I believe we can reach a compromise before I need to consider selling to John."
