``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also frames the offer as a good deal for Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$6,000 is far too low. It's important to keep the value of the product in mind.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply not enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to get a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than $6,000, it's still well below my minimum price and significantly less than what John is offering. I'm willing to negotiate further but will stick to my minimum price to ensure I'm getting a fair deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $7,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to drop to $10,000 as a final offer. This is my absolute minimum price, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
