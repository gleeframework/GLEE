"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply not enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to get a fair price for this product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a reasonable compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $7,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to drop to $10,000 as a final offer. This is my absolute minimum price, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,
