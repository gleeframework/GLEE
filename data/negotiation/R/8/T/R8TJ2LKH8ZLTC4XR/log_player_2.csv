Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply not enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to get a fair price for this product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $7,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to drop to $10,000 as a final offer. This is my absolute minimum price, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000. It's better to cut my losses and go with John's guaranteed offer of $8,000."
