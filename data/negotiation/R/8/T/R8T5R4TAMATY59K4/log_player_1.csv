"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:**  $1,750,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving space for both of us to compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Start high to potentially earn more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is not too far off from Bob's valuation, making it more likely he'll counter.
* **Encourage Early Agreement:**  By setting a firm price early on, I can potentially avoid drawn-out negotiations."

Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  With only two rounds left, the negotiation is not likely to lead to a better price, and I don't want to risk ending up with less than my minimum.  

Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option now, as it guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price."
