"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm very interested in this product and believe it has significant potential.  How about we start at $1,200,000? This represents a fair starting point for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement within our negotiation window.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than what I had in mind, I'm open to finding common ground.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really motivated to make this deal work, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's try $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than my ideal price, I'm willing to be flexible. To finalize this deal, I'm proposing a final price of $1,275,000. This represents a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. ",1275000.0,Alice,5,
