"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we start at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is far too low.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. That's a fair price considering it's worth $1,500,000 to you.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still below what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to budge slightly to $1,350,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
