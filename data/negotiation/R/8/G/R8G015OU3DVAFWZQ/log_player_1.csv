"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we start at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is far too low.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. That's a fair price considering it's worth $1,500,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to try and push for a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still below what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to budge slightly to $1,350,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, $1,325,000 is a reasonable price considering the value for Bob and the time we've spent negotiating. I'm accepting Bob's offer to finalize the deal."
