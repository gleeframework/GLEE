"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll really benefit from it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is your budget, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
