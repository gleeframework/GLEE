"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset to your business. My initial offer is $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a better price, as I have 8 rounds remaining.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,500, which would be $10,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $10,750 is still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with him for a better price, as I have 6 rounds left before I have to decide whether to sell to John. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can push him to come up with a more acceptable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle again, this time at $11,125?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $10,875? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, $10,875 is still too low. I'm confident that I can get a better price if I continue to negotiate with him. I have 4 rounds left, and I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can push him to come up with a more acceptable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see that we're both trying to find common ground. While $10,875 is getting closer, it's still not quite there.  How about $11,000? I'm willing to go a little lower, but I can't go any further than that.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to your business.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $10,900? I think that's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision. While Bob is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, I only have two rounds left.  I've been pushing for a higher price, but it's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to go any higher. I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, he'll walk away and I'll be left with nothing.  To avoid that risk, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  It's not the ideal outcome, but it's the most secure option at this point."
