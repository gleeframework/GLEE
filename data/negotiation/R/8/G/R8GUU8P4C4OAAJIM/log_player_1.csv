Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, knowing that it's worth $100 to Bob, but aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's better than nothing, I can still try to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $110. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum, and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation.  I'm going to accept this offer to avoid risking getting a worse deal in the next rounds."
