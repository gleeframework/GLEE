"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to me and a good value for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but my budget is a bit tighter. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the realm of being potentially acceptable to Alice.  This shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also establishes his financial limitations. By offering a price that's closer to his maximum budget, Bob is increasing the chances of reaching an agreement while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11250? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While it's closer to his ideal price, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I can go.  Would you consider $10,750?  I'm really interested in this product, and this is the absolute highest I can offer."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from his previous counteroffer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. He's still aiming to keep the price below his maximum budget but getting closer to Alice's offer. The message emphasizes that this is his final offer, increasing the pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11000? This is the best I can do, but I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, Bob has already made multiple counteroffers and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, but not enough to reach Bob's desired price.  At this point, Bob is running out of time and might not be able to negotiate a better price within the remaining rounds.  

Therefore, the best option is to buy the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees Bob gets the product at his desired price and avoids further negotiation that might not be successful."
