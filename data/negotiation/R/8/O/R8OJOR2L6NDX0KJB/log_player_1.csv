"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy he's showing interest, $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum. I want to see if we can get closer to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be. Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8750. This is a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,750 is a good offer, I still want to see if we can bridge the gap a little more. I believe the product is worth more than that, and I want to explore options to see if we can come to an agreeable price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,250. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250}
