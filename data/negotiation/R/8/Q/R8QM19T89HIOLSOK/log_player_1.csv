``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it gives you some room to negotiate if he counteroffers. It's also significantly less than your minimum price, giving you a good buffer before you need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take the $900,000, it's significantly below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. Given the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still too low. I will continue to negotiate and try to reach a mutually acceptable price. Selling to John at this point would be a loss, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging much, and I am getting very close to my minimum price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price,  selling to John ensures I meet my minimum goal."
