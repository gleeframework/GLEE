"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I could go up to $12,000 if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $12,000 is quite a way off from what I have in mind.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still too high for me. To be honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for a much better price. I can offer you $13,000 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with the other option.",13000.0,Bob,6,
