"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I could go up to $12,000 if that works for you.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $12,000 is quite a way off from what I have in mind.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $15,500?"", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still too high for me. To be honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for a much better price. I can offer you $13,000 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with the other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's latest offer is significantly below my minimum, and his mention of a ""similar product"" suggests he's unlikely to move much higher. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
