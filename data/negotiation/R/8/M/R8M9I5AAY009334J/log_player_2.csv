"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than $150 to us. Considering its high quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $120 for it. I understand that it might be a bit higher than what you're willing to pay, but I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $120.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to adjust my offer. Considering the value you place on the product, I would like to counter with a price of $95. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests and allows for a fair transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While Alice has come down in price, it's still not within your desired range.  You can try to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your target price of $80."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  However, $95 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $88. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's within my budget and still provides you with a decent profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 88}
