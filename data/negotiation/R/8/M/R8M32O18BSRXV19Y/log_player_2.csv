Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I'm willing to take another small step down and offer the product to you for $10300. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,300

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He is getting close to his target price, and it's likely that Alice won't go any lower.  While he could try to negotiate a lower price, he could risk losing the deal entirely.  Buying from John for $12,000 would be a worse outcome."
