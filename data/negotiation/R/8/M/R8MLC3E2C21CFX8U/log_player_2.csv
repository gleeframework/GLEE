"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that aligns perfectly with your needs.  This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will deliver substantial value.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you.  Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
