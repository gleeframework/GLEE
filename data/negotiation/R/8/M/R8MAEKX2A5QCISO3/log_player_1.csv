Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and it's worth a lot more than my asking price. Are you interested in purchasing it for $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $80.
* **John's Offer:** John provides a safety net at $80.

Offering the product at $100 creates a win-win situation:

* **Bob saves:** He gets the product for $20 less than his valuation. 
* **You profit:** You earn $20 more than your minimum and $20 more than John's offer.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob an attractive price."
