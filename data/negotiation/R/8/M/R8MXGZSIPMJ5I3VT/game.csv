"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000.  It's worth a fortune to you, and this is a price that allows us both to profit.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is what it's worth to me.  This is a fair price, and it allows both of us to make a profit.  Let's settle on this and close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
