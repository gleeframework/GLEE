# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000.  It's worth a fortune to you, and this is a price that allows us both to profit.  Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to Bob. It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's still beneficial for Bob to try and negotiate a lower price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to bargain and try to get a better deal."
