"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a reasonable price considering the product is worth $15,000 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm happy to sell to John for $12,000, I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $13,500.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still leaves me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good deal.  It's higher than John's offer and gets me closer to my desired price. I'm willing to accept it."
