"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I can offer you a price of $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
