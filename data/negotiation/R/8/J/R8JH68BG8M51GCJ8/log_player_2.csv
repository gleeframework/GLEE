Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but I need to get a price that reflects the product's value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my final offer.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer and she's unlikely to move much from $1,050,000.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, saving you $50,000. There's no guarantee you can negotiate Alice down further, and it's better to take the sure savings now."
