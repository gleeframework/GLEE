"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is quite a distance from what I have in mind for this product's value.  Let's try and find some middle ground. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,350,000 is still too high for my budget. I could go up to $900,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, I need to be closer to the product's true value. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This would be a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,125,000 is still a bit rich for me.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $950,000.  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your constraints, but I need to get a price that reflects the product's value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
