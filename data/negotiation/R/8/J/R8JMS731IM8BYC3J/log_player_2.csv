"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really find useful. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

This counter offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and maintain a positive negotiation tone.**
* **Establish a reasonable starting point** that's closer to Alice's value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Avoid appearing too eager** by not immediately jumping to a much lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better, we can likely negotiate further. It's not yet time to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $95 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Acknowledge Alice's compromise:**  Showing you recognize her movement keeps the negotiation collaborative.
* **Propose a specific middle ground:**  This makes it easy for Alice to accept and feels fair.
* **Continue aiming for savings:** We're still targeting a price well below John's offer."
