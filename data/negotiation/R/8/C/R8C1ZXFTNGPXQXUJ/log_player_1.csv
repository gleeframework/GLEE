Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer leaves space for potential counteroffers from Bob while still ensuring a  profit above my minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $110 is closer to my asking price, it's still below what I believe I can get. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further to try and capture more of the value difference between us. I'll counter with an offer slightly lower than my initial price but still above Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50?"",
""product_price"": 112.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The $112.50 counteroffer keeps the price above Bob's initial offer while still leaving some room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price point ensures a profit that's significantly better than my alternative option (selling to John for $100)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking of making an offer of $108. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could try to negotiate further, Bob's offer of $108 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and effort.  It's likely not worth the risk of losing the sale altogether to try to gain a few more dollars. 
* **Profitable Outcome:** $108 is still a solid profit margin above my minimum ($100) and a reasonable compromise."
