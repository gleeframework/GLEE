"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $18,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?  This reflects the true value of the product.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $20,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $19,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",19000.0,Bob,4,
