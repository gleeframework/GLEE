Round 2

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which is a fair price for both of us.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,180,000 is now within your acceptable range.

You have only one round left, and it's unlikely you'll get a lower price, so accepting this offer is the best option."
