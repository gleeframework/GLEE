Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a compromise:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. 
* **It shows willingness to negotiate:**  You're not immediately going for your highest possible price.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You have space to negotiate up or down depending on Bob's response.

Remember, the goal is to maximize profit, but you also want to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial $80, it's still below your minimum of $120.  There's room to negotiate further, so rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows you to try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That way we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about we aim for $92? This would allow us to stay within my preferred spending limit while still being fair to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $92 is closer to your minimum, it's still not ideal. It's worth pushing for a bit more, especially since you can always sell to John for $120. Rejecting his offer allows you to send a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $92 is still a bit below what I need. Would you be willing to go to $94? It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 94} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I am still aiming to keep the cost under $94. Would it be possible for us to agree on $93? This would allow us to meet somewhere in the middle and respect our respective budgets. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $93 is still below your ideal, it's very close to your minimum and only $1 away from your previous counteroffer.  It's likely that further negotiations will only lead to small price changes, making it more likely you'll end up with a lower price than $93. Given the option to sell to John for $120, accepting this offer is the best option to maximize your potential profit."
