"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I know it's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a price that's well below its true value. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,
