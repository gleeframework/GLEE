{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $130. It's a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm looking to spend closer to $115.  Would you be willing to go that low?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $125? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $125, which is still a good deal for me. It's a bit higher than my initial target, but it's still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John."
