"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $155? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $150? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to take the product off your hands.",150.0,Bob,4,
