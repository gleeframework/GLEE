"I understand that $650,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine, and call it $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit, and $775,000 is a bit too low for me. I can do $850,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",850000.0,Alice,5,
