Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.  What do you think?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $10,000 for the product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit hesitant on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer you a price of $9,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I understand this is your lowest price, but it's still a bit higher than I hoped.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,500? That would make the decision easier for me.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I've already offered you a price of $9,000, which is my lowest price. Meeting you at $8,500 would be a loss for me, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to be realistic. I can offer you a price of $9,500, which is closer to my minimum price. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
