"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000. Given its potential, I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):** Opening with a price significantly higher than both Bob's value and my minimum allows room for negotiation. It also immediately communicates the perceived high value of the product.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""unique opportunity"" and ""significant investment,"" I'm framing the price within a context of value rather than just a number.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Using phrases like ""starting point for discussions"" signals willingness to negotiate and avoids immediately hitting a wall.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's seriousness:**  His response will reveal how motivated he is and how much he might be willing to pay.
2. **Maintain control:** Starting high gives me leverage in the negotiation process. 
3. **Leave room for concessions:**  I can gradually lower the price during subsequent rounds, which can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. While I appreciate its value, I believe we can find a more reasonable price. I am willing to offer $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's standing offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have room to negotiate, especially since Bob expressed a strong interest in finding a ""reasonable price."" I'll use the next round to try and meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Your offer demonstrates serious interest, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway between our previous positions at $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic aims to find a compromise that feels fair to both parties. It suggests a willingness to move from my initial position while still reinforcing the product's value.
* **Clear Justification:** By explicitly stating ""halfway between our previous positions,"" I offer a clear rationale for the price and avoid appearing arbitrary.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While a significant concession from my initial offer,  $1,750,000 is still comfortably above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort in finding a middle ground. I would like to counter your offer with $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I still have some leverage. We're only on round 4 of 10, and his willingness to negotiate suggests he might be willing to go higher.  I'll make another counteroffer, but I'll be more cautious with my concessions this time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,600,000 is a significant investment for you, I understand that.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm reducing my price by a smaller amount this time ($50,000 vs. the previous $75,000). This signals that I'm reaching the lower end of my acceptable range.
* **Acknowledging Bob's Position:** By stating I understand $1,600,000 is significant, I'm building rapport and showing I'm considering his perspective. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the higher price without being overly aggressive.

This counteroffer aims to:

* Encourage Bob to move closer to my $1,700,000 target.
* Maintain a firm position without stalling the negotiation. 
* Avoid leaving too much money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach an agreement. In light of your last offer, I am willing to consider $1,650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above the Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is a significant amount above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000, and it's a substantial profit.
* **Strong Position:** While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or become less willing to negotiate. We've established a good rapport, and it's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and allows me to utilize the funds for other opportunities.  

Overall, accepting $1,650,000 represents a successful outcome in this negotiation."
