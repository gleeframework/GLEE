"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below Bob's perceived value. This should encourage him to negotiate. I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $120. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value. I believe I can get a better price with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $105.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, we're already in round 4 and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $105 is a good price and much better than selling to John."
