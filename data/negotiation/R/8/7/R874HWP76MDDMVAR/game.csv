"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 85? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $80? It's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
