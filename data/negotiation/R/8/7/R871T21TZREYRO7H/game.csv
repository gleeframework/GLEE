This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, I'm not quite comfortable with that price point. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000, and I'm still willing to make a profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming closer to my price range.  To be honest, $800,000 is the absolute highest I can go. I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to work with me on that.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $800,000 is your absolute limit, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
