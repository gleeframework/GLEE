"Hello Bob, I'm excited to sell you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $100. Is this something you'd be interested in?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $100 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $95. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $92.50. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $97.50. This is as low as I can go, and I'm starting to think it's worth considering other options. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",97.5,Alice,5,
