Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible, but you also want to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down slightly. 
* **Beat Bob's Valuation:**  The offer is still significantly higher than Bob's $120 valuation, but it might be tempting enough for him to consider if he values the product for other reasons (convenience, time-saving, etc.).

**Important Note:** There's a risk that Bob will reject this offer. However, you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so you don't want to go below your minimum acceptable price."
