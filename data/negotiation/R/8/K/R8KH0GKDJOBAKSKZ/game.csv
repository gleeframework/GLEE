"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,500. This is my best price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $16,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go to $15,500, which is the absolute most I can offer. Let me know if that works for you.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go below $16,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,250. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",16250.0,Alice,5,
