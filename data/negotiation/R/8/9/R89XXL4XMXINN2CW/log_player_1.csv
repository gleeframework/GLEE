Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Testing the Waters:** The $19,000 offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000).  This allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, the high starting point gives you room to negotiate downwards, potentially still landing a sale above your minimum price. 
* **Alternative Secured:** You're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob because you have John as a backup.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and how much you want to ensure a sale to him, you might choose a different opening price."
