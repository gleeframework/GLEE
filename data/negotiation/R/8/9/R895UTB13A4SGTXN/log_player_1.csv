"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with $2,000,000, you anchor the negotiation around a higher value, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's worth.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While you have a guaranteed offer from John, it's always possible to get a better deal. Starting high allows you to potentially secure a price closer to your ideal selling point before considering John's offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $2,000,000 is simply out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). This indicates there's room for negotiation.
* **Below Your Minimum:**  $1,300,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and your initial asking price.
* **Early in Negotiation:** It's only the second round. Rejecting now signals that you're serious about getting a higher price and are willing to walk away from a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique benefits, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you.  To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This is a competitive price considering the long-term potential of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease, But Still Above Minimum:** Coming down to $1,800,000 shows flexibility on your part while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price and closer to your initial offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's long-term value and potential to generate returns, justifying the higher price. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** This offer provides room for further negotiation, allowing Bob to potentially counter with a price closer to both of your valuations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant amount for me.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to achieve a successful deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meets Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.
* **Strong Position:** You've successfully negotiated Bob up from his initial offer of $1,300,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting now secures the deal at a favorable price."
