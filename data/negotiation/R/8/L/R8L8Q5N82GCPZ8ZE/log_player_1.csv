Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with the highest possible price. It's unlikely Bob will accept this immediately, but it establishes my initial position and leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000, which is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price above my minimum threshold."
