"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer downwards in the next round.  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, I'm holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm willing to risk a few rounds of negotiation to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I've lowered my offer from the first round, showing flexibility, but I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below what I know the product is worth to me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing a deal entirely.  The remaining rounds might not yield a significantly higher offer, and I'd rather secure a profitable sale now."
