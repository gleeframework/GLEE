"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.  How about $9,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering what it's worth to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
