Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm really looking to spend no more than $8,500.  If you're willing to come down to that price, we can make a deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I would prefer to get more for the product, Bob is not willing to come up to a price that's acceptable to me. Selling to John is the best option in this situation."
