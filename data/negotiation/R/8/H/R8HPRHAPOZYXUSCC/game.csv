"Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $90 right now. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $90 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $100 for it, which is fair for both of us. What do you say?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell it to you for $110, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",110.0,Alice,5,
