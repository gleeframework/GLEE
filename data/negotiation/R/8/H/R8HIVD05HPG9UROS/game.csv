"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, however, $18,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. How about we settle at $20,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I think this price is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. Can we discuss this further?",17500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $19,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $16,500. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we discuss this further?",16500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need you to meet me halfway. Would you be willing to agree on $18,000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my eagerness to close the deal.",18000.0,Alice,7,
