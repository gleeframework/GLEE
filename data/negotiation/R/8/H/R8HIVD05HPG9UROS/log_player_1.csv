Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently rejecting offers above $16,000 and countering in a way that suggests he's unlikely to go much higher. While we could continue negotiating, there's a real risk of ending up with a lower offer or even having Bob walk away. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which at this point is a better option than risking a lower outcome with Bob.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed deal."
