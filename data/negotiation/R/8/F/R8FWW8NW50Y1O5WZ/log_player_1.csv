Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $11,500.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling at $11,000 or higher is still a better outcome than selling to John for $10,000. 

This offer balances ambition with a realistic chance of success."
