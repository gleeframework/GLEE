"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still a significant amount above your target of $800,000.
* **You have room to negotiate.** You have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, so there's no need to rush into accepting Alice's initial offer. 

By rejecting the offer, you can start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:**  Starting with a low offer (significantly lower than Alice's price) will signal your intent to negotiate aggressively and potentially get a better deal. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** While $700,000 is a significant discount, it's still above Alice's desired price of $800,000. This allows for potential negotiation and a mutually agreeable outcome. 

Let's see how Alice responds to this initial counteroffer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your target.** $850,000 is still above your desired price, but it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $900,000.
* **Time is a factor.** With only 7 rounds remaining, it's getting riskier to continue negotiating.  
* **The risk of a higher counteroffer is present.**  Alice might reject your next counteroffer and propose an even higher price, potentially putting you in a worse position. 

While you could continue to negotiate, accepting this offer is a reasonable compromise that allows you to secure the product while still getting a substantial discount."
