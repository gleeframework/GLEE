"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing it further! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's opening message is just fluff, and her offer of $120 is too high. You can do better by rejecting and seeing if she counters with a lower price or going with John as a backup."
