# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential value of your product,  $500000 is significantly below what I can justify at this time.

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer of $1000000. Let's compromise and meet in the middle at $875000. This would still be a substantial profit for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?
