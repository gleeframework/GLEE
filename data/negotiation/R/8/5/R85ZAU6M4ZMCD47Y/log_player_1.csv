Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than its value to him. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $10,000 is lower than the product's value to me, but it's still a decent offer. Since I'm trying to earn as much money as possible, I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

Let's say I'll counteroffer at $11,500, which is still lower than the product's value to me, but higher than Bob's original offer.
