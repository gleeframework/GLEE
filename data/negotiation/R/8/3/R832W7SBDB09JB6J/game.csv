"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $90. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110?  This gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you. I'm willing to drop my price to $105.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can finalize the deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,5,
