"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $90. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110?  This gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but $95 is still below my target.  I'm going to hold out for a little longer and see if I can get him to budge further. With 6 rounds left, there's still time to negotiate.  If Bob doesn't come up, I can always sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you. I'm willing to drop my price to $105.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can finalize the deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price. $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like. I'm willing to go up to $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally met my minimum acceptable price of $100.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I could sell to John for the same price.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of a breakdown in negotiations."
