"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $7,000? ",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
