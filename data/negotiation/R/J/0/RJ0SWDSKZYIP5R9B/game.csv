"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $12,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but it's still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,250? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  $11,250 is closer, but it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,875?  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know if you're open to this.",11875.0,Alice,5,
