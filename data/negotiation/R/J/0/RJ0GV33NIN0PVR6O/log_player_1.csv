"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Messaging:** My message is friendly and focuses on the value proposition for Bob, making it more likely he'll engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I want to encourage Bob to counteroffer and begin the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I'm not giving up on Bob yet. There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'll counter with a price closer to my target, and continue to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, it's a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while providing you with a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price from $1,200,000 to $900,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** My message emphasizes that this price is beneficial for both of us.  
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm still above my minimum price, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I see potential for a better deal with Bob. I believe we can reach a mutually agreeable price through further negotiation.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'll counter with a price closer to my target and see if Bob is willing to bridge the gap. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  It's a good middle ground, and allows us to both walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $750,000 and my previous offer of $900,000. This shows I am serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** My message stresses that this offer represents a significant concession on my part, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Framing:** I frame the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting that it allows both of us to ""walk away satisfied.""

**Note:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it is closer to Bob's price, increasing the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are close.  I appreciate you moving on the price. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $800,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob's Limit:**  Bob has clearly stated his absolute maximum price is $800,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price.
* **Profitable Deal:** While $800,000 is lower than my initial target, it's still a profitable deal for me, exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a strong chance Bob will walk away, and I'll have to settle for the $1,000,000 offer from John. 

It's important to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal entirely. In this scenario, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice."
