"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $600,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me ($800,000). It's worth negotiating further to try and get a better price.  I have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to try and close a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $600,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to pay.  Considering the product's value and my budget, I'm offering $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $700,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I have several rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate to try and get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $700,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $725,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to accept $725,000. I'm willing to meet you at $725,000, but I need to make a bit more. I'll offer $725,250. This is a slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,250 is very close to my desired price of $725,000. While it's slightly higher, it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and the risk of the deal falling apart.  The remaining rounds could be used to negotiate a further decrease, but there's no guarantee of success, and time is running out. Accepting the offer allows me to acquire the product while remaining within my budget."
