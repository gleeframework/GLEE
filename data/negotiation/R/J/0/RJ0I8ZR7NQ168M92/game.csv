"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $600,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $600,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to pay.  Considering the product's value and my budget, I'm offering $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $700,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $725,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's try to close this deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to accept $725,000. I'm willing to meet you at $725,000, but I need to make a bit more. I'll offer $725,250. This is a slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",725250.0,Alice,5,
