Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a price higher than my minimum value of $1,200,000, leaving room for potential profit. However, it's not an outrageous price that would likely scare Bob away. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to earn as much as possible. By offering a higher price, I have the potential to earn more than my minimum.
* **John as a Backup:**  I have a guaranteed fallback option with John, so I'm not taking a huge risk.
* **Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, I can use John's offer as leverage to potentially negotiate a better price with Bob later. 

By striking a balance between potential profit and avoiding a sure rejection, this offer maximizes my chances of a successful sale while staying within the acceptable range."
