"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1200000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1350000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $1250000 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I can do $1300000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
