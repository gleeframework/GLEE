"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This offer is way too high.  Alice is starting very high ($20,000) compared to my limit ($12,000) and John's offer. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limited budget. Would you consider something closer to $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Anchoring:** By proposing $8,000, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. 
* **Leaving Room:**  I don't want to go too low and offend Alice, so I'm leaving some space for her to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer. While $8,000 is too low, I understand your budget constraints. Could you do something closer to $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but $17,000 is still significantly higher than both my budget and John's offer. It seems like there's room to meet somewhere in the middle. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a little on the price.  To be honest,  $17,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Could we possibly settle around $10,000? I feel that would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between her previous offer ($17,000) and my previous counteroffer ($8,000). 
* **Justification:** By using phrases like ""fair compromise,"" I'm trying to maintain a positive negotiation tone while pushing for a price closer to my target. 
* **Strategic Counter:** This counteroffer is still significantly below Alice's last offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate upwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $10,000 is still quite a bit below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I believe that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price I might consider, but $13,500 is still above my ideal limit and what John is offering. I'll try one more time to negotiate down, but I need to be prepared to walk away if she doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we make it a deal at $11,000?  That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my last offer to add a sense of urgency and seriousness to the negotiation.
* **Slight Increase:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by increasing my offer slightly.
* **Below John's Price:** This offer is still below John's price, giving me a good bargaining position.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'll likely buy from John for $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your persistence. It seems we're close to a deal. While $11,000 is a little under what I hoped for, I'm willing to accept if this will close the deal today.  Let me know your final decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has agreed to my final offer of $11,000. This is a great deal! It's below my $12,000 limit and saves me $1,000 compared to John's offer. There's no need to negotiate further."
