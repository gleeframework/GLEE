"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limited budget. Would you consider something closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer. While $8,000 is too low, I understand your budget constraints. Could you do something closer to $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a little on the price.  To be honest,  $17,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Could we possibly settle around $10,000? I feel that would be a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $10,000 is still quite a bit below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I believe that reflects the true value of this product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we make it a deal at $11,000?  That's my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your persistence. It seems we're close to a deal. While $11,000 is a little under what I hoped for, I'm willing to accept if this will close the deal today.  Let me know your final decision.",11000.0,Alice,7,
