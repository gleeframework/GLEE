{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a lower price? I am willing to consider offers up to $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price and his valuation of the product. We have room to negotiate and should aim for a price closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to work within a budget. While the product's value is truly reflected in my initial offer, I'm willing to adjust slightly.  Would you consider $1,100,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We are moving closer to Bob's offer but holding firm closer to our desired price. This shows flexibility while still emphasizing the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, I am proposing an offer of $1,075,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while still staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a reasonable compromise. It exceeds our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and provides a significant profit. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
