"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $12,000 from John, so anything less than that is a better deal. While $10,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation and Bob should try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $10,000. This price is still within Bob's budget and may be attractive enough for Alice to consider, especially since she values the product at $8,000. This counteroffer presents a good middle ground for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial budget of $12,000 and only slightly higher than his previous counteroffer.  There's a chance that Alice might not budge further, and buying from John would cost him more. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
