"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's first offer is pretty close to my maximum price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation and keeps us well below my $120 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm thrilled with.  I'll counter-offer again and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $97.50?"",
""product_price"": 97.50
}
```

This keeps the negotiation moving and shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $97.50. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $102. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, and $102 is a reasonable price â€“ a decent saving compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and close the deal."
