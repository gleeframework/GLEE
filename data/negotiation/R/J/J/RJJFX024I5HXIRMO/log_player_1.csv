Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $120, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal:** Offering it at $140 means if Bob accepts, he might feel he got a good deal since it's less than your initial asking price.
* **Balancing profit and the risk of losing the sale:**  There's a chance Bob might reject $140. However, you're guaranteed $150 from John if Bob refuses.  Offering it at $140 maximizes your potential profit while still having a safety net."
