I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not convinced I can't get a better deal.  I'll see if I can push Bob a little higher with another counteroffer."

I've decided to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I would like to get closer to my original desired price, Bob's counteroffers are getting too low, and I'm worried it will be too much work to negotiate further.  I think John's offer is a good compromise, and I'm confident I can find another buyer if I need to in the future."
