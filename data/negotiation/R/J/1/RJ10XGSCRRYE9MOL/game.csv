"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from the price I was hoping for. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is the closest I can get to my target, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get your target price, but I'm still at my limit. I can offer you $15250, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to accept it, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",15250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I can offer it to you for $16250, which is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. I'm getting close to the point where I'll have to consider selling to someone else.",16250.0,Alice,7,
