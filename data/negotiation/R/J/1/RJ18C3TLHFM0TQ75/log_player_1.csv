"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get, making it more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message implies flexibility, signaling that I'm open to counteroffers. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest while maximizing my potential profit.  If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer in the subsequent rounds.  However, I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I can potentially get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Time is on My Side:** With 8 rounds remaining, I have the luxury of continuing the negotiation and potentially reaching a better deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not selling to John yet.  I believe I can secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate. My next counteroffer will likely be closer to $9,500 to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to meet halfway.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm focusing on a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintain Upper Hand:**  While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to close the gap further.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in splitting the difference and accept. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me propose a counteroffer of $9,100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** We're getting closer, but I believe I can still push for a higher price. 
* **Time is on My Side:** I have 6 rounds left.  The more rounds we negotiate, the higher the chance I can secure a price closer to my target.

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but not selling to John yet. My next counteroffer will be close to $9,250 to try and get a deal closer to my desired range.  I'm still confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $9,150.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal, I think we're both getting what we want."", ""product_price"": 9150} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his last counteroffer. This shows good faith and encourages him to close the deal.
* **Focusing on Value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my price point.
* **Urgency (But Not Pressure):** I subtly suggest that closing the deal is in both of our best interests.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is my last attempt to get a price closer to my desired range before considering selling to John. If Bob rejects, I will seriously evaluate selling to John. However, I'm hoping that the compromise and urgency in my message will convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,125. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is only $125 away from my previous counteroffer and is very close to my desired price range.
* **Time is Running Out:** We are now in round 6, and with only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob increases.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, accepting this offer could build a positive relationship with Bob, leading to future collaborations or purchases.

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer a higher price, it's getting increasingly likely that I won't reach my target. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing out completely.  The potential for future deals with Bob makes this a good strategic decision."
