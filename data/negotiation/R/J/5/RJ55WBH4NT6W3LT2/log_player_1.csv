Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice's offer, along with the reasoning:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will not sell for less than $1,200,000 because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. He won't pay more than this. 
* **The Zone of Agreement:** Any price between $800,001 and $1,199,999 could potentially work for both Alice and Bob.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for the highest price Bob is likely to accept.  Here's an offer that balances profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the deal:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. Let me know if you'd like to discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning**

* **High Anchor:**  The offer starts at a strong point within the zone of agreement, leaving room for potential negotiation (though Alice should be prepared to hold firm).
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's value, subtly justifying the high price without explicitly mentioning Bob's lower valuation.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message invites further conversation, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer without feeling pressured.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice has any insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, agreeable), she can adjust her approach accordingly. 
* **Market Information:**  While not provided in the prompt, real-world factors like market demand and competing offers could influence the optimal price."
