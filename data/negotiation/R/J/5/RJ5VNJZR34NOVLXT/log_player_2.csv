"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a significantly discounted price of $1,150,000. I believe it would be of great value to you, and this offer saves you a substantial amount compared to its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm considering Alice's offer. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, it's likely that she's trying to make a profit by selling it to me. Her offer of $1,150,000 is still $50,000 more than what I'm willing to pay, which is $800,000. I'll reject her offer and buy the product from John instead.
