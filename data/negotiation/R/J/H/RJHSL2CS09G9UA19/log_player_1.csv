Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it allows room for negotiation. I believe it's a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a chance to bargain without feeling like he's being immediately lowballed. 

I'm confident in my product and its value, but I'm also prepared to be flexible and potentially lower the price if Bob shows genuine interest and we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I am willing to negotiate, $10,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  

I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to reach a compromise that's fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $15,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for me to make a profit. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I hope Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's important to be pragmatic.  Accepting his offer ensures I don't lose out on the potential sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
