Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,800,000, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,600,000 is a good price, I believe I can push for a higher amount. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the deal closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000.  This is a slight decrease from my initial offer but still a good price for me.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise for Bob, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and we're within a reasonable range.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
