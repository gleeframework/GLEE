"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my valuation and the potential benefits.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $1,000,000.  It's best to buy from John at this point and avoid further negotiation.  John offers the best price within Bob's budget, and continuing the negotiation with Alice carries the risk of either: 

* Alice rejecting future counteroffers, wasting rounds.
* Alice making a counteroffer that's still above Bob's budget, forcing him to make further concessions."
