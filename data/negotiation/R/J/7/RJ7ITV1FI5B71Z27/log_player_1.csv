Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, my goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but wants a better deal. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still potentially attractive compared to missing out on the product entirely.

By starting high, I increase the chances of either:

1. **Bob accepting:** This would result in the highest possible profit.
2. **Negotiation:**  This opens the door for a back-and-forth where I can potentially settle at a price higher than $15,000. 

Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, I haven't lost anything because I have John as a reliable backup."
