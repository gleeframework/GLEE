{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a little below what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still gives me a good profit. I'm hoping to get a quick deal, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum price of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $75 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to sell it at that price."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $82 is just above my minimum price of $80, and it's likely I won't get a better deal from him. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him."
