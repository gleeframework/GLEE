"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more to me. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $120 for your product. Let me know if this works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'll consider it, but I would like to stick to my initial proposal of $120. Let's hope we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $120 is still not a price I can accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $130 for this round.  If we don't come to an agreement, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I'm still interested in purchasing your product, but I cannot exceed $125. This is my final offer. I hope we can agree on this price.",125.0,Bob,6,
