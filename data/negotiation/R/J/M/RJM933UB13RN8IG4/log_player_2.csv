(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $9,000 is a fair offer, it doesn't quite meet my minimum price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This still leaves plenty of room for you to benefit from the product's value, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you say?
