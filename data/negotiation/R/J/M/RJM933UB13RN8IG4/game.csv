"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your value and still gives me a healthy profit. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'm not sure if I can stretch it to $12,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $9,000 is a fair offer, it doesn't quite meet my minimum price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This still leaves plenty of room for you to benefit from the product's value, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above your minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
