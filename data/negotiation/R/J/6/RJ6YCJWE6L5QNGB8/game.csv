"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've done my research on similar products.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this unique product.  How about $950,000?  This price still allows you to gain significant value, while ensuring I can continue to operate my business.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. I believe this price is reasonable considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
