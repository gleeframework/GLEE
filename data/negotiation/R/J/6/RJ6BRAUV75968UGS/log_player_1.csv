Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob is persuaded by the ""exclusive opportunity"" framing. 
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its worth to him.
    * You make a $150,000 profit, which is better than John's offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, further increasing your potential profit."
