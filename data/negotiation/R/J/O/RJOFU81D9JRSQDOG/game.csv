,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still well below what I could get from another buyer. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
