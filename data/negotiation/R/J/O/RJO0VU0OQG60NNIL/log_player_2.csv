"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. Even though you could get a better price if you rejected Alice's offer and waited for John, the risk of losing the product to someone else is too high. It's better to secure the product now at a slightly higher price than to risk losing it altogether."
