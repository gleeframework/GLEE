Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin for Alice.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value is even higher than Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Backup Plan:**  The safety net of John's guaranteed purchase at $1,000,000 allows Alice to confidently aim high with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice can then negotiate down, but always aiming to stay above the $1,000,000 mark to maximize her profit."
