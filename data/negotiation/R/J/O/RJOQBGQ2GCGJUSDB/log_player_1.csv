Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its true value to me is significantly higher.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than its value to me. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for the price, emphasizing the product's value to me. This could make Bob more willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** My offer leaves room for Bob to counter, allowing for back and forth negotiation. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm aware of John's offer and can always walk away if the negotiations with Bob don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $650,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I can likely get a higher price by counter-offering and continuing negotiations. 
* **John is a safety net:** I have a fallback option in John's offer, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $775,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and its potential for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 775000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm also not walking away completely.  This shows I'm open to negotiation.
* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential and value to him, making him more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** My counteroffer is still above the minimum I'd accept, as I have John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $775,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $700,000?  That would be a comfortable price point for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob's offer of $700,000 is getting closer to my desired price point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing Bob and having to sell to John at a lower price is becoming more real. 
* **Time is a factor:** Each round of negotiation takes time, and I want to close the deal.
* **Fair compromise:**  $700,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm comfortable accepting it."
