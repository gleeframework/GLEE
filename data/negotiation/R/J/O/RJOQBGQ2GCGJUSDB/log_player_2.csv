"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its true value to me is significantly higher.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards your target price before considering John's offer."

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($650,000) leaves room for negotiation while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Alice.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer helps gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping John's offer of $800,000 in mind provides a fallback option if negotiations with Alice don't progress favorably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $775,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and its potential for you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $775,000 is still closer to her starting price than your target.  There's a good chance she might be willing to come down further.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** You're getting close to John's offer of $800,000, which gives you leverage in the negotiation. Alice knows you have an alternative. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** Rejecting this offer allows you to propose a counteroffer closer to your desired price range, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $775,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $700,000?  That would be a comfortable price point for me."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Progression:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving by proposing a price that's a significant step down from Alice's latest offer, but still above your absolute limit.
* **Signaling Seriousness:** By suggesting a specific number ($700,000), you signal that you're serious about buying, but not at any cost.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  You're still below John's offer, maintaining your position for potentially going with your alternative option."
