"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you.  I understand it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's still very attractive.  Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
