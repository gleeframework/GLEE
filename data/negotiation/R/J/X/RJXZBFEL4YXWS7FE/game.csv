"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a strong opening offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $700,000 to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a reasonable price.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming closer.  I appreciate the effort you've made to find a price that works for both of us.  To be totally transparent, I have a hard limit at $750,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for being transparent about your hard limit. I understand that $750,000 is a significant concession from your initial offer, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, considering the product's true value to you, I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $775,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",775000.0,Alice,5,
