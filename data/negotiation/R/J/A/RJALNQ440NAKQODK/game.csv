"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for well below its value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
