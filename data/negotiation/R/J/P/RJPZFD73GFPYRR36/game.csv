"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm looking for something that fits within a tighter budget. Would you be willing to consider $10000? I'm really interested in this product, and I think it's worth it to me, but I need to stay within my means.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget of $8000. Would you be willing to consider $12000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13500. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $13500 is still out of my budget. I've made a serious offer of $12000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that I should just go with John's offer of $8000, as it's a much more reasonable price. Would you be willing to reconsider and meet me at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,8,
