Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a significant savings and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the same as what John is willing to pay. Since I can't get a better price from Bob and I'm already at my minimum acceptable price, I'll accept Bob's offer."
