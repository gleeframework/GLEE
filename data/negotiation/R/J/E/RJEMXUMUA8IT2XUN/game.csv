"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm going to need to start a bit lower. How about $1200000?  I think that's a fair starting point for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to start a bit lower, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $1350000, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit high, though.  Would you be willing to consider $1250000?  That's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I can meet you in the middle at $1300000. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1275000?  That's a small jump from my last offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise and gets us very close to a deal.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1280000, but that's as close as I can get. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to wrap up the deal here.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
