"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but your price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to offer $1100000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $1100000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product for $1300000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1300000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford at this moment. I'm willing to offer $1250000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. This is my absolute top limit, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I'd like to make a small adjustment to sweeten the deal. I'll throw in some additional support and services that will enhance the product's value. In return, I'm willing to meet you at $1280000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
