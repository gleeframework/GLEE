I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, giving Bob room to negotiate.  I'm also setting a positive tone to encourage a smooth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a price that's drastically below my worth. I'll counteroffer and try to find a more agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer:

I'm still not willing to go below $9,000, but Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired value. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to find a middle ground."
