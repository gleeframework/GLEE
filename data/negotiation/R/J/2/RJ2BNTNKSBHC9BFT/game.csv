"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This would still be a great price for you and allows me to get closer to my desired value.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to find a fair deal.  Let's split the difference. How about $9,000? It's a good price for both of us, and we can move on.",9000.0,Alice,5,
