Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think it's a great deal for something you'll find valuable."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth even more. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering $120, I'm setting a high ""anchor"" price. While Bob may not pay that much, it makes an offer closer to $80 seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer at $80 (John), so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant."
