"Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However,  $15000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $17500. This reflects a significant price reduction from my initial offer and shows my commitment to finding a deal with you. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $17500, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $16000? This is a fair price for us both, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,
