Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer of $80.  While it's better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's still a great price for a product worth $100 to you, and it gives me a fair margin. Let's work together to find a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but I'm still finding it hard to justify $105. How about we split the difference and settle at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $92.50. While it's a bit lower than I'd hoped for, it's still above my minimum acceptable price and it's likely we'll continue to haggle if I reject it.  It's better to secure the sale now and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
