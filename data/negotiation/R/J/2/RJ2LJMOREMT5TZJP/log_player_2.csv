"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice is willing to lower the price, and you could save a significant amount. Buying from John at $1,000,000 is a safe option, but it's worth trying to get a better deal first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. This shows my willingness to negotiate while leaving room for further bargaining. It's a bold move, but it could force Alice to reconsider her position and potentially lead to a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as there's a chance she'll come down further.  There's also a chance that I can get a better deal with a counteroffer. However, I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $950,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product but still trying to get a better deal. It's a compromise that could potentially bridge the gap between our positions.  I'm still mindful of John's offer, but I believe I can negotiate a more favorable price with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $50,000 lower than John's price. The risk of continuing to negotiate is not worth the potential reward.  It's unlikely that I can get Alice to lower her price significantly enough to justify the continued effort. It's better to go with the guaranteed price from John."
