"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit higher than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still leaving a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $120, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130, which is still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give away too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum. Offering $125 shows I'm serious about selling, but still hoping to earn a bit more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough. I've had 6 rounds of negotiation and haven't reached my ideal price. To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'll sell to John.  It's not the best outcome, but it guarantees I don't lose money."
