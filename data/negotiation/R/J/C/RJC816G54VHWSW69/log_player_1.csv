"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build a good rapport with Bob.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price allows for several rounds of negotiation without me having to immediately go down to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for negotiation:** I can still potentially reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested. While $90 doesn't work for me, I'm open to considering a price closer to the middle ground.  How about $105?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Staying firm:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive and engaging:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, $95 is still below my acceptable price range.
* **Room for improvement:** I believe I can still get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in control and allows me to potentially secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price we're both happy with. How about $100?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm now proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows my willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Emphasizing value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept my offer to finalize the sale."
