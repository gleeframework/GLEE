"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $75 for the product. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $85. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",85.0,Alice,3,
