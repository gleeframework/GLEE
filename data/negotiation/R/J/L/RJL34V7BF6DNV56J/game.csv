"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,500,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I can only go up to $1,150,000 at this point. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. This is the lowest price I can go, and I'm confident that it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much on the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
