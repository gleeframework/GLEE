"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for $8,000. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go higher than $9,000. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000, it makes more financial sense to sell it to John and avoid further negotiation."
