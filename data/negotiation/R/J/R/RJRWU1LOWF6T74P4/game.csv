"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, considering its potential to me.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle.

I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, while also being fair to me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value. However, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  To continue this negotiation, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it shows my commitment to reaching a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
