Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. Aiming for $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Scarcity and Urgency:** Highlighting the product's exclusivity and mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Confident Tone:**  A confident tone implies the product's value is justified, making Bob more likely to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a degree of risk. Bob might be turned off by the high price and walk away. However, given your fallback option (John), it's a calculated risk worth taking to potentially earn an extra half a million dollars."
