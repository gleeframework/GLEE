Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree there's a lot of value in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 6

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to my acceptable price range, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,200,000 mark I need. I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  It makes more sense to take the sure thing and avoid further negotiation rounds with an uncertain outcome."
