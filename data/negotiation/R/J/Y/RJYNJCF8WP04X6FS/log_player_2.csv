(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is way too high.  It's more than double what the product is worth to me, and I'm not going to even consider it. I'll start by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $160 is still too high for me, but I'm not sure how much room Alice has to budge. I'll counteroffer one last time before seriously considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
