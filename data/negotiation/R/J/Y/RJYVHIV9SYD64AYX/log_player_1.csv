"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a high baseline and gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  I believe the product is worth more than this, and I'm willing to test Bob's interest at a premium price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher, and I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to be flexible, but it still leaves a decent profit margin for me. I believe this price might be appealing to Bob, as it's not too far from his initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to take $1,750,000, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation, hoping Bob will come closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,850,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, showing Bob I'm serious about closing the deal. It's also a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's latest one, which could make it more appealing for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough choice, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,725,000. We are down to the last few rounds and the risk of rejection is high. I'm also worried that John might not be a reliable buyer, and I need to secure a sale quickly."
