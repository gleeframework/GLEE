"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the market value. However, the value of this product to me is quite high, and $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
