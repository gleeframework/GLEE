"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring further negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial price point.  However, I'm looking to secure a better value for this product.  Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000? I believe this price reflects a fair market value for the unique qualities you've described."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better value, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial price.  While I could try for a lower price, there's a risk of her walking away or me reaching the 10-round limit and being forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's a good deal, and I should take it."
