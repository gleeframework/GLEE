Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $11,000?**  This offer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still ensuring I make a decent profit.
* **Why not go higher?**  If I ask for more, Bob is more likely to reject, and I'll have to sell to John at $12,000.
* **Why not go lower?**  If I lower the price, I'm leaving money on the table, and I'm not maximizing my profit potential. 

By offering $11,000, I'm balancing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher sale price than selling to John."
