"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, based on my budget and assessment of the product's worth to me, I am unable to agree to the price of $1800000. Could we perhaps negotiate a price closer to $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000.

"I appreciate your determination, Bob, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, I've already made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go as low as $1650000. I'm willing to meet you at $1675000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",1675000.0,Alice,7,
