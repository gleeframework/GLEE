"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1175000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than his ideal price.  He can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to his target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. How about $1190000? This is a compromise that takes into account your willingness to negotiate and the value of the product to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice is getting increasingly stubborn and the price is getting closer to his maximum budget. It's not guaranteed that he'll be able to get a lower price with further negotiations, and there's a risk that the negotiations could drag on indefinitely. Buying from John guarantees a price of $1,000,000, which is his target price and saves him time and effort."
