"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150?",150.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $150 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $162.50? That's a fair price for both of us, don't you think?",162.5,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming to keep my spending within $150. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $156.25?",156.25,Bob,4,
