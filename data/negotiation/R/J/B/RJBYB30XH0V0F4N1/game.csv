"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the market.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still quite low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This offer reflects the product's true value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's try $15,500. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our needs.",15500.0,Bob,4,
