"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal for you, as it's still below its value to you, and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but only if the price is $10,150. This is a small increase from my previous offer, and a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's work together to find a solution.",10150.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really need to stay within my budget, and I'm not comfortable going above that price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
