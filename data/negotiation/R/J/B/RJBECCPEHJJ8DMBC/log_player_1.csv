{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob and making it a positive interaction. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by inviting Bob to respond. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing John's offer of $15,000 allows me to be firm in my negotiations with Bob, knowing I have a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There is still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as a Backup:** I can still sell to John for a higher price, so I'm not in a rush to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?  That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by offering a price closer to Bob's offer.
* **Fair Price:** I'm framing the new price as a ""fair price"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm lowering the price, I'm still not going below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  If that works for you, let's make this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for counteroffer:** I can likely push for a higher price by making another counteroffer.
* **John is still an option:** I have a backup option in John, who will pay $15,000. This gives me leverage in continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However,  $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a significant compromise. It's the best I can do at this point. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a final price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Firm Stance:** I'm stating that it's the ""best I can do"",  signaling that I'm nearing my limit.
* **Open to Closing:** I'm giving Bob a clear decision point. He either accepts or we move on.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not giving in completely to Bob's offer, as I still have John as a backup buyer."
