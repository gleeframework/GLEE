"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,000? ",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?  That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  If that works for you, let's make this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However,  $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a significant compromise. It's the best I can do at this point. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",10000.0,Alice,5,
