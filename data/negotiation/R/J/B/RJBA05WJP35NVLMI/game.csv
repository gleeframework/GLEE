"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $16000.  That's a significant discount from my original offer, and it still leaves a little room for negotiation. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16000.  I'm still a bit over my budget. How about $15500? That's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my limits.",15500.0,Bob,4,
