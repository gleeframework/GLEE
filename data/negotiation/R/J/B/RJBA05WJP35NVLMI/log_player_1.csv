"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, it's still close. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.  I'll try to bridge the gap in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  That's a significant discount from my original offer, and it still leaves a little room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16000.  I'm still a bit over my budget. How about $15500? That's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's a good deal for both of us, and accepting it avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even a deal falling through.  While I could try to squeeze out a little more, the chance of losing the deal altogether makes it a better decision to accept this offer."
