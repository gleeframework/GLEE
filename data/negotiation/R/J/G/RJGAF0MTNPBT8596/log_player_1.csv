Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This is a strong opening offer, leaving some room for negotiation. It's significantly higher than John's offer, making it appealing to Bob while still allowing me to potentially secure a higher price.  I'm confident this offer will entice Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and my initial offer. I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's.  It shows flexibility while still allowing me to achieve a higher price than John's offer. I'm confident this offer will entice Bob to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer hasn't changed, and I've already made a significant concession. At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price higher than John's offer.  It's time to secure the guaranteed sale and move on."
