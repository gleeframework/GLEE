"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'd like to reject the offer. The product is worth $8,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $10,000, which is $2,000 more than I'm willing to pay. I'll look elsewhere for a better deal.
