"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $950,000 is too high, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm confident in the value of this product at $950,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we agree on $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth exploring if he can reach a deal closer to his target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to go up to $875,000. This price would give you a good profit while staying within my budget. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I value your interest and want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $887,500? This represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer of $887,500. While he'd prefer a lower price, it's a good deal considering his maximum budget of $1,000,000. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk of Alice rejecting and the deal falling through. It's a good compromise, and he's still saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
