Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,500 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a price closer to $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would allow both of us to get a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to secure this product.

Alice is now offering $11,000, which is still above your budget.  You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so you should go with that option."
