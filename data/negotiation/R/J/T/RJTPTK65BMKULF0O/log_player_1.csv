I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I make a decent profit.  I'll keep in mind John's offer of $12,000 as a safety net if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's not worth selling for. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as it's the same price John is offering. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price considering his initial offer, and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum price. While I could continue negotiating, it's getting time-consuming and I'm confident John will buy the product for $12,000. It's a better deal than accepting Bob's offer, so I'll sell to John."
