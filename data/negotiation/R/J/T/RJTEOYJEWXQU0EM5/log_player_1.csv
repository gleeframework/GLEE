"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?"", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly anchored at $15,000 and unwilling to budge. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob. Time is money, and I'm better off taking the sure thing with John."
