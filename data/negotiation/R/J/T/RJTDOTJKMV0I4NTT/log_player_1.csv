Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise, and it's above my minimum price of $100.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
