"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a fair starting point.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product would be valuable for me, I think $900,000 is a little high. Could you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still think the product is worth more than $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $700,000. I'm willing to come down to $725,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. I think this is a fair compromise.",725000.0,Alice,5,
