"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I do see the value in this product, $14,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $9,500 is too low for me. This product is truly top-of-the-line and worth every penny.  Would you consider $12,000? ",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're asking for a fair price.  $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
