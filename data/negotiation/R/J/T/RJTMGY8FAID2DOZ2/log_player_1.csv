Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I do see the value in this product, $14,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're asking for a fair price.  $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:

Bob is clearly very interested and getting closer to my minimum. Accepting $10,500 guarantees a profit above my fallback option (John)."
