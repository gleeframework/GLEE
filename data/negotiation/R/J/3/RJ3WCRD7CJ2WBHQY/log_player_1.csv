"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum value. I'll try to get closer to my price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm confident you'll find this product is worth that price."", ""product_price"": 110}
