Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is significantly below my minimum price.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique value. I hope you'll accept and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is being stubborn, and it's unlikely we'll be able to close a deal that meets my minimum price. To avoid risking more time and potentially a lower offer, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's a guaranteed deal and ensures I get my desired value."
