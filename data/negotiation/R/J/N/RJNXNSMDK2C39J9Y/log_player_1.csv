Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a little high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a more competitive price. Would you consider $900,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations. To move forward, I'd be willing to offer $1,050,000.  This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial agreement.

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
