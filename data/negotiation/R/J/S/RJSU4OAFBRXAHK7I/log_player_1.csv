I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I think I can still do better.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $9,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and gets us closer to a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'm going to see if I can get a bit more out of him before I consider selling to John."
