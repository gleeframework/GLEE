Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I believe this product is worth a good price, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway and offering a price closer to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
