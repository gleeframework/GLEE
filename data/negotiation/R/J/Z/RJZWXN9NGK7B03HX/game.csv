"Alice,  $1500000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
