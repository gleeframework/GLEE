"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the price down a bit.  I'm willing to pay $700,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I want to ensure I'm getting the best possible value.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it will bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",750000.0,Alice,3,
