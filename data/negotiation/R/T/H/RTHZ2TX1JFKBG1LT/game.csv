"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9000. I'm willing to compromise, though.

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9200 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $9500 again?
