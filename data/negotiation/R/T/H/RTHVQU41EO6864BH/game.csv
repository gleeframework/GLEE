"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is still far from my expectations.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
