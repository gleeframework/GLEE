"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob."
