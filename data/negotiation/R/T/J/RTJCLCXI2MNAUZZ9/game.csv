,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about $125?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $132.50. It's a great price, and I think you'll really get a good deal.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $132.50 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $128.75.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the sale.",128.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be fair, Bob, but I still think I can do better than $128.75. I'll meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $130.375. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",130.375,Alice,5,
