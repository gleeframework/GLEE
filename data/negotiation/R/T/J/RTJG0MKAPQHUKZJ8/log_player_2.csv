"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  It offers significant value, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, it's still within the range of John's offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before potentially settling for John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential value, I'm not ready to commit to $950,000 at this point. To make this deal work for me, I'd need to bring the price down to $850,000.  This would be a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while allowing for a comfortable profit margin for me."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with a proposal. While $850,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product sits significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while still allowing you a substantial profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still higher than my desired price point. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I will reject this offer and try to lower the price further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value.  However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $900,000. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while still giving me a reasonable return on my investment. "", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to find a middle ground here, but I'm afraid $875,000 is still below what I consider acceptable for this product. I'm willing to make one final concession at $887,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price for the value you'll be receiving. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $887,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $870,000.
