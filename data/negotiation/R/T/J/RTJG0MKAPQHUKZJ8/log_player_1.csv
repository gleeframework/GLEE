Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential value, I'm not ready to commit to $950,000 at this point. To make this deal work for me, I'd need to bring the price down to $850,000.  This would be a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while allowing for a comfortable profit margin for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $850,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product sits significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while still allowing you a substantial profit margin."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value.  However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $900,000. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while still giving me a reasonable return on my investment.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to find a middle ground here, but I'm afraid $875,000 is still below what I consider acceptable for this product. I'm willing to make one final concession at $887,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price for the value you'll be receiving."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $887,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $870,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to walk away satisfied.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000

While a higher price might be ideal, Bob is unlikely to move much further. Accepting $870,000 ensures a significant profit above your minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
