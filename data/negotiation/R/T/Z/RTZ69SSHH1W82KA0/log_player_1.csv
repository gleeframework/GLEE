Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,800 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,200, which is still a great deal for you considering its value.  Let's find a middle ground, I'm sure we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $11,200. How about $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $11,000 is a good deal considering the potential of losing out to John, and Bob seems willing to compromise."
