"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm confident you'll get a lot of use out of it. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  Could you meet me halfway at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant difference for me.  How about we settle at $14,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $14,500 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, and if you're not able to accept it, I'll have to look elsewhere.",13000.0,Bob,6,
