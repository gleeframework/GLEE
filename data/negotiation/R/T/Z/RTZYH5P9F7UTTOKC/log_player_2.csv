"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $110 is a bit too close to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room for negotiation there is. I believe it's a reasonable starting point considering my $120 maximum budget and Alice's $100 valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'll try to push for a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $97? That's a fair price that works for both of us, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 97
}
``` 

I'm moving closer to her price, but still aiming for a good deal. I believe this offer is attractive enough for Alice to accept while leaving me with some savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $102? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm getting a bit concerned about the time spent negotiating. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that she might not be willing to go much lower.  While I could try to negotiate further, $102 is a reasonable price and a decent saving compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and avoid potentially losing the deal."
