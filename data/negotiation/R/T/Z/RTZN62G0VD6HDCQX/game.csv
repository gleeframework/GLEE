"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
