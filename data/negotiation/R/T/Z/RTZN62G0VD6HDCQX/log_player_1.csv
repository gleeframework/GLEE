{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, balancing my need to make a decent profit (at least $140) while recognizing that Bob is likely to negotiate. If he rejects, I can still make a profit by selling to John, so there's no risk of losing money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, I can still get a higher price from either John or by counteroffering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
