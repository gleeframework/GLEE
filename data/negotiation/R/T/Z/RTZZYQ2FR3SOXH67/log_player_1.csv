Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, starting at $119 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John at $120.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring we don't miss out on a sale entirely."
