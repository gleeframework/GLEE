,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm willing to pay that price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low. How about we compromise at $98? That's a fair price, and I'm willing to go no lower.",98.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you at $97, but that's as low as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",97.0,Bob,6,
