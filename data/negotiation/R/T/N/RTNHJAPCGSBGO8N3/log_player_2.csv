"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value may be different for you. To start, I'm offering it to you for $120. This price takes into account both the value of the product and the opportunity to close the deal within our 10-round negotiation period. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. Considering the value of the product and the time we have left, I would like to propose an adjusted price of $110.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but $110 is still above my budget.  I'm confident I can get a better deal elsewhere, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105.  Let's try to close this deal and make it worth both our time."", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $101, which is my absolute final offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($101), which is only $1 more than your initial target price ($100).**
* **You only have one round left, and there's no guarantee that you'll be able to get a better price.** 
* **Accepting the offer allows you to secure the product while minimizing your costs.**

While you could theoretically reject the offer and try to get an even lower price, the risk of not getting a deal at all is too high. It's best to accept Alice's offer and close the deal."
