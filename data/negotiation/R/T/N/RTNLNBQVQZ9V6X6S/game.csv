"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is fair considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle for $120? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will benefit both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
