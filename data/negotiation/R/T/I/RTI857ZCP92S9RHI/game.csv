"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $1100000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1175000? This offer is still very good for you, considering the value you place on this product.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible deal, and I respect that. However, $1075000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $1125000 to make this work.  This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
