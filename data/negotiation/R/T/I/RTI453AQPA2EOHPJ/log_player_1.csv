Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps to build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the product's value to me emphasizes its worth and justifies the price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and then adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer or rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, but I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, considering your budget constraints. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's price but still staying above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I highlight the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and suggesting a win-win scenario.
* **Maintaining Openness:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and avoid closing the door to negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's reaction to my counteroffer. If he rejects again, I'll need to reassess my options, considering John's offer and the potential for further negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $920000. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  While I could make another counteroffer, there's no guarantee Bob will accept it, and continuing the negotiation risks a stalemate or further price reduction.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,200,000 without further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll contact John and finalize the sale.  While I would have liked to reach a deal with Bob, maximizing my profit is the priority, and John's offer provides the best financial outcome."
