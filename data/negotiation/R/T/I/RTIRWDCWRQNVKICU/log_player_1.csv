"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This gives me a decent margin while leaving room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a bit more, but I'm confident I can make a profit even if he counters with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, aiming for a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm counter-offering with $170.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility.  It's still above my minimum, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I hoped for, it's close to my desired price and ensures a good profit. Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob will walk away, or I might run out of rounds.  Selling to John for $150 is my minimum, so this offer is better."
