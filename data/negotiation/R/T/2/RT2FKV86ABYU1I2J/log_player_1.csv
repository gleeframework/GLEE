Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
