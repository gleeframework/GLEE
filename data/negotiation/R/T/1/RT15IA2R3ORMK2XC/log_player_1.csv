Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. How about $110? Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest. $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $125. This is my final offer - let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $125 is getting closer to my minimum price of $100, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to accept his offer now than risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower price."
