"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's starting price is too high. While it's true the product is worth $8,000 to me, my goal is to save as much money as possible. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower than $9,000 to start negotiating a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $7,500 is still closer to my maximum budget than my ideal price. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer that's closer to $6,000. There's a chance Alice might accept a price lower than $7,000 to avoid going through another round of negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $6,800. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200, which is a bit closer to my original offer. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to you. Let me know if this works for you.

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, but I'm still only $400 away from my fallback option. I'll push one more time.  If she doesn't budge significantly in the next round, I'll go with John."

Alice is unwilling to come down to a price that makes it worth continuing the negotiation.  At this point, it's more beneficial for me to take the guaranteed $8,000 deal from John rather than risk Alice rejecting me again and potentially losing out on both offers."
