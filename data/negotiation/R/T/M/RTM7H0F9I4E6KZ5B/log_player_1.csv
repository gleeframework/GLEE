Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  If Bob rejects, we can negotiate. But if he doesn't bite, I can always go with John for the guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

$700,000 is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm coming down a bit, but still keeping a good profit margin. Hopefully Bob sees the value and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob seems unwilling to budge much.  John is offering a safe and secure deal that's closer to my minimum.  I'll take the guaranteed $800,000 and move on."
