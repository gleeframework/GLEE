"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better price by rejecting the offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $1,250,000, which is a significant drop from Alice's offer and is closer to my maximum budget. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a better deal. I believe there's still room for Alice to come down a bit further, and I'm confident I can get the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $1,275,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's counter-offer. It's still within my budget but shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway. This counter-offer demonstrates that I am serious about buying the product while still pushing for a price that is closer to my desired target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $1,325,000, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Negotiations seem to be going in circles, and it's likely that Alice is unwilling to come down further. To avoid potentially getting stuck in a never-ending negotiation, I'm choosing to take the guaranteed deal with John for $1,200,000. This ensures that I get the product at a price within my budget."
