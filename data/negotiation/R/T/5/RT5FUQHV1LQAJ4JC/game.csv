"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $15,000 to you, and we're looking to sell it at $14,000. Let's make this deal happen!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your interest in our product. I understand your budget constraints, and I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,500. This is still above the $12,000 John is willing to pay, so let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be completely transparent, John's offer is quite tempting.  I'd be willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my absolute limit.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, considering your last offer, I think we can find a middle ground. How about we set the product price at $11,500? This would still be a good deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,250? That seems like a fair compromise.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm glad we're making progress. Considering our previous discussions, how about we agree on a price of $11,375? This is slightly above your last offer, but still below John's offer. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.",11375.0,Alice,7,
