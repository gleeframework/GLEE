"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still allows you to make a profit. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm counteroffering at $15500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",15500.0,Alice,5,
