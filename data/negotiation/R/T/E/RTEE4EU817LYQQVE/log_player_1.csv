Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:**  You have a safety net with John ($15,000), so you don't need to go below that.
* **Starting high:**  Beginning with a higher price ($19,000) leaves room for negotiation. Even if Bob tries to haggle, you're more likely to land at a price higher than your minimum.
* **Positive framing:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more receptive to the price, even if it's higher than his initial perceived value. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while maintaining the possibility of securing a deal with Bob."
