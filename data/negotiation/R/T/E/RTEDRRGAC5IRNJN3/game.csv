"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $115 for it.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I go down to $125?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's try $120.  It's my final offer, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree.",120.0,Bob,4,
