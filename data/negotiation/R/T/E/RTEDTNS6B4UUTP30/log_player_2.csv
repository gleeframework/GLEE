"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  At this point, it's a good deal for Bob and he should accept.  He's saving $350,000 compared to buying from John.  While he might be able to push for a slightly lower price, it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting and then having to buy from John at a much higher price."
