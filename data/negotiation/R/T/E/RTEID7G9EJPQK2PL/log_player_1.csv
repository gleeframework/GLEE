"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I'm leaving some room for negotiation but still aiming for a substantial gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually acceptable price.  I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my initial offer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $875,000, which is still a significant profit for me. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, as it's closer to his original valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's a guaranteed sale.  There's no point in risking losing the deal with Bob and potentially ending up with the same price by selling to John."
