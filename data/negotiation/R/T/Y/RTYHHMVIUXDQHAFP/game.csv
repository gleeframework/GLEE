"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm starting the bidding at $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. This reflects the maximum I'm willing to pay.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have a standing offer for $1,000,000 from another interested buyer. However, I believe in being fair and giving you a chance to finalize the deal.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,025,000. This is my final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your transparency and the opportunity to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it would be a good deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
