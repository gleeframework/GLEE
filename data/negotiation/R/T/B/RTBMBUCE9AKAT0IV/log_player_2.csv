"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it would be an excellent addition to your collection. Considering its true worth, we're offering it to you at a special price of $14,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an item valued at $15,000 for a competitive price. We trust this offer will meet your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is only slightly better than your alternative of buying from John for $15,000.  There's room for negotiation here. By rejecting her first offer, you might:

* **Encourage a counter-offer:** Alice might be willing to lower the price further to make the sale.
* **Force her hand:** Knowing you have another option could make her more flexible.

You're aiming to save as much as possible, so it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal before settling for $14,000."
