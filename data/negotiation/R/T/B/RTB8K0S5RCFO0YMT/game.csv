"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I've done extensive research and analysis to determine its worth, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial returns. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your perspective on the product's value,  $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product, but I need to stay within a reasonable price range.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To show I'm also serious about finding a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this deal completed.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm committed to making this deal work, but  $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and is the highest I can go. Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
