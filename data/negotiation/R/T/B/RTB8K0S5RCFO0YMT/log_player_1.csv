"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and John's offer ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Using positive language and emphasizing the product's value helps frame the negotiation in a favorable light. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By calling it a ""starting point,"" I signal that I'm open to discussing the price further and finding a mutually agreeable deal.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, Bob might be willing to pay considerably more.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will provide valuable insight into his willingness to pay and how aggressively I can negotiate in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While his message aims for a quick resolution, accepting would mean a substantial loss ($700,000 or more). I'm better off negotiating further or accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I've done extensive research and analysis to determine its worth, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial returns. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** The large decrease from $2,200,000 to $1,900,000 shows a willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price well above both Bob's offer and John's standing offer. 
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out numbers; I'm re-emphasizing the product's value and my research to support the higher price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal how flexible Bob is willing to be. If he's entirely unwilling to budge from his initial offer, I might consider accepting John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand your perspective on the product's value,  $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product, but I need to stay within a reasonable price range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has increased significantly, signaling his interest. However, $1,100,000 is still $400,000 less than John's guaranteed offer.  I believe there's room for negotiation to close the gap further.  I'm willing to continue for another round or two, but if Bob doesn't move closer to at least $1,300,000, I'll accept John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To show I'm also serious about finding a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this deal completed."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price considerably, but staying above John's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Deadline Implication:** By emphasizing this is a compromise and I want to close the deal, I subtly introduce a sense of urgency without giving an explicit ultimatum.
* **Testing the Waters:** Bob's response will determine my next move. If he accepts, great! If he counters below $1,500,000, I'll likely go with John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm committed to making this deal work, but  $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and is the highest I can go. Let's find a way to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing more commitment and has significantly increased his offer, it's still below John's guaranteed $1,500,000.  Bob has also indicated that $1,300,000 is his ""highest"" offer.  

At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob outweighs the potential reward:

* **Risk:**  Bob might not budge from $1,300,000. I'd risk ending up with a lower price than John's offer or missing out on both deals if negotiations drag on.
* **Limited Upside:**  Even if Bob slightly increases his offer, it's unlikely to be significantly more than $1,500,000. 
* **Guaranteed Offer:** John provides a secure and immediate $1,500,000. It makes strategic sense to take the guaranteed profit now."
