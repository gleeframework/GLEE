"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is well over his budget, and there's no reason to accept this first offer. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to go any lower than this.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her original price, it's still above his budget. He should try to negotiate further to get closer to his desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're really serious about buying this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to go any lower than this.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's final offer is still above Bob's budget, and he has a reliable alternative in John who is willing to sell the product for $10,000. It's better to avoid further negotiation with Alice and secure the product at a price he's comfortable with."
