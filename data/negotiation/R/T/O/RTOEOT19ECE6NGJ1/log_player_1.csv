"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling point. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I have time to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is simply too low.  This product offers substantial value to you, and I'm confident it's worth more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
