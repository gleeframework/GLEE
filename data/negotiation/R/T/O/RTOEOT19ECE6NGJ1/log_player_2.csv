"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering the value you'll gain from it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.**  
* **There's room for negotiation.** I'm willing to try and get a better price.  
* **I have 10 rounds to work with.** This gives me time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling point. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is simply too low.  This product offers substantial value to you, and I'm confident it's worth more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within my budget of $1,500,000.** 
* **It's a decent price, and while I'd love to get it lower, there's no guarantee I can push further.**
* **We're only on Round 3, and I don't want to risk going too far and losing the deal.**  By accepting, I get a good price and avoid further potential negotiation that could stall the deal."
