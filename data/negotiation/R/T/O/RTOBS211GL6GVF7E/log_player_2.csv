"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but you have room to potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's start with a lower offer of $1,000,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still saving you a significant amount."

Alice is coming down a bit, but there's still room for negotiation. Let's see if we can push for a lower price."

Let's try a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a reasonable compromise, closer to Alice's offer, but still leaving some room for potential savings."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000

Alice has come down to $1,120,000, which is a good deal compared to John's price. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will only result in small savings. It's more beneficial to accept the offer and secure the product for a reasonable price."
