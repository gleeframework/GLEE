{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price. There are still 9 rounds to go, so rejecting the offer gives you room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it establishes my firm upper limit. It's likely Alice will reject this offer, giving us room to negotiate a middle ground."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'll continue to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal.  I still have 7 rounds to go, so there's room for further bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer from $1,000,000 to $1,200,000, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This is still lower than Alice's offer, but it's a significant step closer to her asking price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my ideal price point, but it's getting closer.  I believe there's still room to negotiate a better deal, and I'm willing to see if I can get Alice to come down further. I have 5 rounds remaining, which is still a good amount of time to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,250,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but it's still within my budget.  This is a compromise from my previous offer and a reasonable counteroffer to Alice's latest offer. With 4 rounds left, the pressure is on to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget and is only $25,000 more than my previous counteroffer. With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm comfortable accepting this offer. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm saving $25,000 compared to buying from John. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will either reject my counteroffer or increase her price again. It's better to take this offer and close the deal."
