Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and this is a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we also want to make the offer attractive to Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us closer to our desired amount.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 gives us a strong fallback position. We don't need to go below our minimum price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale with Bob."
