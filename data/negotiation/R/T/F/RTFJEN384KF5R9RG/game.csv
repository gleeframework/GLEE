"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This still gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. Let's seal the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
