It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a better price. You can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations fail."

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, hoping to get the ball rolling.  Let's see if she's willing to meet me halfway."

Alice is coming down a bit, but I still think we can get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my desired price."

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. Hopefully, she'll see that I'm willing to compromise and accept a price closer to her asking price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is now offering $810,000, which is getting closer to my desired price. It's worth accepting her offer now, as further negotiation might not yield a much better price and could lead to a stalemate. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than to risk losing it altogether."
