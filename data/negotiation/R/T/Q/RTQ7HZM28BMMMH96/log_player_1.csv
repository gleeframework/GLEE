Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, hoping to see if Bob is willing to meet it. If he's not, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll always have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and even though I can sell it to John for $120, I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110, which is still above Bob's offer, but closer to his range. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Although I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price. Since John is willing to buy for my minimum, I'll sell to him."
