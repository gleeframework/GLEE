"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the value to Bob, making it more appealing. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, setting the stage for further discussion. 

**Important Note:**  While I want to maximize my profit, I'm also considering the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer and needing to counter-offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his responses and how many rounds remain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think we can work out a better deal. How about $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I believe there's still room for a higher offer.
* **Balancing risk:** While selling to John for $12,000 is tempting,  I have 8 rounds left, which gives me time to explore a potentially better deal with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired $12,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer also keeps the pressure on Bob and signals that I'm not desperate for a sale.

**Next Round:** I'll need to craft a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but still acceptable to me, considering my goal of maximizing profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9750? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm aiming for a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to work towards a solution.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I frame the counteroffer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially encouraging a deal.
* **Maintaining a target price:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm still aiming for a price higher than Bob's last offer, keeping my profit goal in mind.

**Important Note:** I'll continue to monitor Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he continues to reject my offers, I may need to consider selling to John sooner to avoid losing too much time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but given my budget, I think $9500 is the maximum I can afford. I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining the target price:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000, and Bob's offer is just a bit too low for my desired profit margin. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  We're now in round 4, and there are 6 rounds left. This gives me enough time to try and squeeze out a slightly higher price.  
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer once again keeps the pressure on him and shows I'm willing to walk away if necessary.

**Next Round:** I'll craft a counteroffer that's slightly higher than $9,500 but still below my original offer. This will show flexibility while reminding Bob that I'm not willing to settle for his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9600 is the lowest I can go. This still gives you a great deal on the product, and it's fair to me as well."", ""product_price"": 9600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight compromise:** I'm offering a small concession, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" Bob will get at this price, appealing to his perceived value of the product.
* **Fairness:** I'm reiterating the ""fairness"" aspect, hoping to strike a chord with Bob and encourage him to accept.

**Important Note:** I'm still evaluating the risk of selling to John for $12,000. If Bob continues to reject my offers, I'll need to weigh the potential for a higher price against the time remaining and the certainty of a sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, I propose we settle on $9400 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are now in Round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left.
* **Limited potential:** Bob's offer is further away from my desired price, and his responses suggest he's unlikely to budge much further.
* **Guarantee vs. Potential:**  While I might be able to squeeze out a slightly higher price, it's not guaranteed, and the risk of losing more time is too high. 
* **Certainty of profit:** Selling to John ensures a sale for $12,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer and meets my minimum profit requirement.

**Conclusion:**  Given the limited time and the potential for a drawn-out negotiation with Bob, I'm choosing the certainty of a sale to John. This ensures I achieve my profit goal while minimizing the risk of not closing a deal at all."
