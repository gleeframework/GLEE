"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to stay within my desired range.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $7,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a reasonable agreement. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
