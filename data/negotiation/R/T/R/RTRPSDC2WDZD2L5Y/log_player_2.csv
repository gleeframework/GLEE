"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$8,500 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.** You're aiming to save as much as possible, and it's likely Alice is willing to come down a bit. 
* **You have 10 rounds, so there's no rush.**  You can explore what Alice's bottom line is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** Starting with a lower price will signal your intent to get a good deal. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see how much she's willing to drop. 
* **Leave room for compromise:**  There's still room to increase your offer if necessary, but it's a strong starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has already moved significantly.** She's come down from $8,500 to $7,500, which is a good sign she's willing to negotiate.
* **You're getting a good deal.** $7,500 is significantly less than your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **No need to risk further.** There's always the chance Alice will reject your next counteroffer, and you might end up paying more than $7,500. 

It's better to secure this price than to risk a longer negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price."
