{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, you only have 3 rounds left. You've already spent a significant amount of time negotiating and it's likely that the price will not drop below your $10,000 limit within the remaining rounds.  It's best to take the guaranteed price from John to avoid further negotiation."
