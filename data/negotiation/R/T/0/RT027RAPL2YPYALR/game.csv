"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this opportunity.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
