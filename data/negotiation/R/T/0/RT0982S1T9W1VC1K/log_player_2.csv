"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you have a backup option with John.  Let's see if we can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $150 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  How about $125?  I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $125 is tempting, I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.  How about $135?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved closer to my price point, and $135 is a good compromise.  I'm willing to accept it to avoid the risk of losing the product or needing to buy from John at a higher price."
