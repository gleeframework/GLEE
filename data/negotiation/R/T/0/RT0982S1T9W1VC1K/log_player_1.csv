"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $150 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  How about $125?  I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is better than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $125 is tempting, I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.  How about $135?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 135}
