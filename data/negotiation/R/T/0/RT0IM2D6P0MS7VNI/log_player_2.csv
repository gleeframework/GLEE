"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that. Let me know if you're interested!  If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $14,000, while John wants $15,000. 
* **You're still within your budget:**  The product is worth $15,000 to you, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product while saving $1,000 compared to buying from John."
