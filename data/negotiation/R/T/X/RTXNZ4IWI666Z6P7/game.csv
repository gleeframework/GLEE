,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $9,500 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $12,500. This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this, I'll have to look elsewhere.",11000.0,Bob,4,
