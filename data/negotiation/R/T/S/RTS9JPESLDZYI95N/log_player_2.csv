"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth a lot more to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth exploring further negotiation with Alice to see if a lower price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is my best offer, as it's my maximum budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to start with a counteroffer that's close to his maximum budget, but leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Justification:**  A $12,500 offer demonstrates to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but also positions him for further negotiation.
* **Message:** The message highlights Bob's willingness to compromise and emphasizes his maximum budget to signal sincerity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $13,500? It's a good compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and his maximum budget is $12,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** While $13,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum.
* **Strategic Justification:**  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further.

**Next Steps:**  Bob should counteroffer again, aiming to bridge the gap and get closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $13,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  Bob's counteroffer of $13,000 moves halfway between his previous offer of $12,500 and Alice's current offer of $13,500. This shows a willingness to meet Alice halfway.
* **Signaling Compromise:** The message emphasizes that Bob is making a ""significant compromise,"" further demonstrating his sincerity and increasing the pressure on Alice.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  This offer still leaves some room for negotiation, allowing for a possible adjustment if needed."
