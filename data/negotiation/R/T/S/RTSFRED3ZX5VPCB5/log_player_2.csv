"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a significantly better price than $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $300,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $500,000. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to negotiate further and potentially reach a price that's more favorable for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $400,000 is still a great deal compared to John's price of $1,200,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer, and I might end up having to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a significantly reduced cost."
