"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm going to counter with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product's value justifies it.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm going to counter with a price of $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can meet in the middle now.",850000.0,Alice,5,
