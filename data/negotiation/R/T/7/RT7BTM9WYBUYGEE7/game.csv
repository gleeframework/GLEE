"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so my counteroffer is $14,000 for the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to reach a price that's closer to the product's true value. My counteroffer is $13,500 for the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm feeling like we're getting bogged down here.  I can do $11,500, but that's my best offer.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I still think we can do better than $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and my previous offer of $13,500. My counteroffer is $12,500 for the product.",12500.0,Alice,7,
