"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  After careful consideration of its value, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,450,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too far from what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,375,000. I believe this price represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position. To be frank, $1,300,000 is cutting it very close, and I have to consider other options if we can't bridge this gap. I'm willing to accept $1,350,000 - that's my final offer. I believe this is more than fair and allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
