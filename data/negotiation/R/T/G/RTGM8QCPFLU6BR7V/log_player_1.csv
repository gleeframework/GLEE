"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value ($150) but below what I believe the product is worth to Bob ($120). 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the value of the product without explicitly stating Bob's potential benefit. This approach aims to keep him engaged and open to negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is designed to:

* **Test the waters:** See if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my valuation.
* **Set the stage:** Establish an initial bargaining range.
* **Keep the option open:**  If Bob rejects, I can still move towards John's offer or counter with a lower price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $160, which reflects the value of the product and is still a fair price for both of us. Let's keep this deal moving forward, how about it?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price from $175 to $160, showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price of $150. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I'm remaining positive and emphasizing a fair price for both parties, while also subtly reminding Bob of the product's value. This keeps the conversation constructive and prevents the negotiation from becoming adversarial.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a middle ground:**  This counteroffer attempts to bridge the gap between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm not accepting Bob's initial price, but I'm also showing flexibility. This keeps the negotiation dynamic and gives me the best chance of closing a deal at a favorable price.
* **Staying above John's offer:**  I'm still above John's offer, ensuring I'm not losing out on potential profit."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Minimize risk:** By selling to John, I guarantee a sale at my minimum acceptable price without any further rounds of negotiation, which could potentially lead to a lower offer from Bob. 
* **Time efficiency:**  Selling to John allows me to close the deal immediately, saving time and effort.

**Note:** While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, the opportunity to sell to John without further negotiation makes it the more advantageous option at this point."
