Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This would still represent a significant return for you while acknowledging the true worth of this product.

Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.
