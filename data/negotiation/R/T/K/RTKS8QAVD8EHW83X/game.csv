"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but is more in line with my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This would still represent a significant return for you while acknowledging the true worth of this product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but is more in line with my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,600,000 is simply too far below my bottom line.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product brings. Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
