Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $15,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it's worth a premium.  How about we meet halfway at $16,500?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and respect the value of the product. However, I am unable to meet at $16,500. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $15,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While ideally, I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is clearly demonstrating strong interest while also setting a firm limit. Accepting his offer of $15,500 is a good compromise that still yields a significant profit above my minimum."
