# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $720,000, but I need to emphasize that this is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

At this point, Alice has strongly signaled that $720,000 is her bottom line.  Continuing to push could backfire, leading her to break off negotiations. It's a good price compared to John's offer and a significant saving."
