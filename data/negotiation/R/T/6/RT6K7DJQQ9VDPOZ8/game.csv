"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a strong offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit high. How about we start the conversation at $650,000? ",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far off from that price point.  How about $700,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to go up to $725,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This product is still a significant investment for me, and I need to make a profit. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $710,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $720,000, but I need to emphasize that this is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",720000.0,Alice,7,
