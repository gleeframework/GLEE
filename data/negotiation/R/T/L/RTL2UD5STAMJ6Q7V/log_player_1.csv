"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself some room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation, which could encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Leaving Room for John:**  I'm leaving enough room to potentially accept a lower price if necessary, but I also want to make sure I'm getting as close to my minimum as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $8800 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range. I'm not willing to sell for that price just yet.
* **Negotiation:**  I want to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Round:** I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,800 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,100. This way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the deal for both of us, which might make Bob more likely to accept.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I'm still aiming to get a price closer to my minimum, but I'm showing flexibility.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm still keeping John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price range and my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk of Going Higher:**  If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or offer a lower price in the next round. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing a deal that's close to my target.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale.
* I will keep John's offer in mind for future opportunities."
