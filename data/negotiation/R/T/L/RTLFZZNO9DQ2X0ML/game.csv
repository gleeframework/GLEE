"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1300000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $1150000?  This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement that benefits everyone.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1150000 is a significant discount, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, I'm willing to consider a small concession. I can offer it to you for $1220000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
