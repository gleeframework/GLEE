"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but below my minimum ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with a question invites Bob to engage and makes him feel like he's part of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer by referencing the value of the product to Bob.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Again, I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $14,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price. I believe I can potentially get a better deal with a counteroffer, and I'm still comfortable holding out for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,500. This is a very fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a compromise to show flexibility.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price for both of us to build rapport and encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  At this point, it's clear that further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to get me to my desired price. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum, and with only 4 rounds remaining, it's the safest and most profitable option."
