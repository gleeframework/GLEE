Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I acknowledge the product's potential, $1,500,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, a price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.
