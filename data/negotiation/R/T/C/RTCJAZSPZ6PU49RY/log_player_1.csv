Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know this is worth at least $1,500,000 to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get even closer to the true value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to close the deal, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is too low for the product's value, and I have time to see if I can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,600,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $1,520,000. I think this is a more reasonable price, considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,520,000 is a good price, considering the potential for further negotiation and the risk of reaching a stalemate.  It's also above the value I set for myself, and closer to the value Bob sees in the product. It's a win-win!"
