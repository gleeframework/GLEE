"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,800,000 for the product.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this deal. My counteroffer is $1,600,000 for the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable walking away and buying from John.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,600,000 and $1,500,000, so my counteroffer is $1,550,000 for the product. This is my last chance to negotiate, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still not comfortable paying more than $1,500,000. I'm ready to close the deal at that price, but if you're not willing to accept it, I'm going to have to move on to John's offer.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
