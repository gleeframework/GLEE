Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. It's worth $150 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Offering a price too close to John's offer ($120) risks Bob rejecting it outright. 

This strategy aims for a win-win: Bob gets a product he values at a discount, and you maximize your profit beyond your minimum acceptable price."
