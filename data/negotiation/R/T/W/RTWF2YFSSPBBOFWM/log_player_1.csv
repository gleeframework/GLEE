Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) and my minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $120.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, the potential for a higher profit outweighs the risk of losing him as a buyer."
