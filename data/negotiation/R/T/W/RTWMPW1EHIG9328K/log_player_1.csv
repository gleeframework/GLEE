Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the true value you'll gain from it."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that considers the value I would gain from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and the product's actual worth to him. It's clear there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits for you.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,700,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but your current offer is still outside my budget.  I can go up to $1,200,000. This is my final offer; otherwise, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Meeting Bob's Value:**  Bob has explicitly stated that $1,200,000 is his limit.  Pushing further risks losing the deal entirely. 
* **Profit Margin:** While not ideal, $1,200,000 is still a significant profit. Holding out for a much higher price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer might not be worth it. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Dragging out negotiations further delays receiving payment. Accepting now allows for quicker reinvestment or use of the funds."
