"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that considers the value I would gain from the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits for you.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,700,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but your current offer is still outside my budget.  I can go up to $1,200,000. This is my final offer; otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
