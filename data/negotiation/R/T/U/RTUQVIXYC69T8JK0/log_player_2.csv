"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $100 to you, and while I value it highly, I'm willing to part with it for $90. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you stand a chance of getting a better deal from her in a counter-offer, or you can stick with your backup plan of buying from John."
