"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000 for this product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $650,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both parties.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the $650,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,100,000? I think this is a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value while staying within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations here. While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, I have to be realistic about the product's worth. My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product brings.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're firm on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable going above $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value while staying within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,6,
