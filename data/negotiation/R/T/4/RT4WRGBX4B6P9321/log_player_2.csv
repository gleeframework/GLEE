"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the value you place on the product at $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing further and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the initial offer allows for further bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering your value of $800,000, and it allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This price still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and the offer is now below Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($1,500,000).  It's a good deal for Bob,  so accepting is the best choice to save money and acquire the product."
