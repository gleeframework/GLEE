"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm proposing a special introductory price of $140 for you. This is an excellent opportunity to experience the benefits of our product at a discounted rate compared to its market value of $150. I trust it will meet your needs and exceed your expectations. Please let me know if you're interested or if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is less than John's price of $150, but it's still above your $150 limit. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or stick with buying from John as a last resort."
