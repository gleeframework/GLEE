"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a nice product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  It seems like we both value the product, but maybe there's some middle ground. How about $118?"", 
 ""product_price"": 118
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think we're getting close!  How about $122? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd like to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and is getting closer to your ideal price.  $122 is a good deal and saves you a decent amount compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield much more savings and risks the deal falling through."
