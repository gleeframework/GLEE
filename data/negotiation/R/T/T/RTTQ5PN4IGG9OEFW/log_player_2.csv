Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than that to me.

While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll reach a number that beats John's offer of $800,000.  At this point, cutting your losses and buying from John guarantees the best price and avoids further negotiation."
