"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still too high. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Bob is aiming to get a good deal, so he's starting his counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $12,000 is still within Bob's budget and likely a fair price for a product worth $10,000 to Alice. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** Bob's message conveys his interest while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident in the value this product holds. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above what Bob is comfortable with.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob still has some leverage and can potentially negotiate a lower price. 
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John is a last resort, and Bob still wants to see if he can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Let's meet in the middle again at $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is showing willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's offer. 
* **Fair Price:** $12,500 is a good middle ground that benefits both parties, as it's still within Bob's budget and offers a decent profit margin for Alice.
* **Positive Tone:** Bob maintains a positive tone to encourage Alice to accept."
