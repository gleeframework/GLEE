Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, so I need to offer it at a price lower than his valuation but higher than my minimum.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $140 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also creates the perception of a discount while still securing a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have the security of John as a backup buyer at $150, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
