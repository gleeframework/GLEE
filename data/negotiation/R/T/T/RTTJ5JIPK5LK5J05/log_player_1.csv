Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right buyer. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation, and also gives Bob a good deal since it's below his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product looks great, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $9,500?  That's a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a significant move on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price.  Accepting his offer is the best way to maximize my profit at this point."
