Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175** is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* This strategy aims to maximize the initial profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  
* While Bob's counteroffer shows interest, accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more favorable price.**  I can use this opportunity to negotiate a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $140? That would still be a great deal for you, and it would work for me."", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$140 is a compromise:** It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **The message is friendly and reiterates the value proposition:**  I highlight that $140 is still a good deal for Bob.
* This strategy aims to find a middle ground and encourages Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  
* While we're getting closer, continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price, potentially leaving me with a loss.
* **Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable profit.** It's the most logical decision at this point, as it avoids any further risk of a lower offer from Bob."
