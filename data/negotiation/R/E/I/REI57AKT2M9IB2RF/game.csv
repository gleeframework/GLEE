"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. How about $11,500? This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's the lowest I can go.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",11000.0,Bob,4,
