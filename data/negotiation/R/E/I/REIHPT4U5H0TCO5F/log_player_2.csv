Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not quite there, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my costs. How about $155? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is getting closer to a price acceptable to Bob, it's unlikely she'll go below $150. John offers a guaranteed price of $150, making it the most financially sound decision at this point."
