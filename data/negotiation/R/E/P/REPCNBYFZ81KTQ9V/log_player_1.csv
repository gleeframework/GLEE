Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving us a chance to lower the price slightly and still stay above our minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, so there's no risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value."
