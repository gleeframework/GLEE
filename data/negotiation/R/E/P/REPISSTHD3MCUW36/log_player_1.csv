Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a good starting point.** It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and open to discussion.** It emphasizes the potential benefit for both parties. 
* **This strategy aims to get the negotiation started and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.** 

**Important Notes:**

* **This is just the first offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response.**
* **I'm keeping John's offer in mind. If Bob doesn't agree to a price that's at least $12,000, I'll sell to John.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum desired price of $12,000, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. 
* I'll keep John's offer in mind. If Bob's counteroffers don't reach at least $12,000, I'll switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum but still trying to be flexible.  $9,500 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Message Focus:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the value of my compromise. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to further negotiation but want to see if this counteroffer is acceptable to Bob.
* **Next Steps:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still a significant drop from my minimum of $12,000. Given that Bob is not willing to come up much, and I'm already several rounds in, I'm not confident I can get to a price I'm comfortable with. 

I'm going to accept John's offer of $12,000. This ensures I get my minimum desired price and guarantees a quick and easy sale."
