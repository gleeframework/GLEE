I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for him, considering the product is worth $8,000 to him. If he rejects it, I can always sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to him than to John, I'm not willing to drop my price that much.  I'll make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant drop from my original price, but I'm still confident that this is a fair price for both of us.  I believe that it's a good deal for Bob because it's still below what the product is worth to him, and it's also a good deal for me because it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I hope that Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to drop my price any further.  I'd rather sell to John for $10,000 than settle for less."
