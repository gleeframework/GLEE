"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's something you value at $150, and I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate but still leaving me with a good profit. 
* **Friendly approach:**  The message is friendly and highlights the potential value to Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for higher price:** While I could accept and sell to Bob, I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Not yet desperate:** I'm not yet desperate to sell, as I have the option of selling to John for $120. 

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $125 is tempting, I'm hoping to get closer to $135.  I'm confident this product is worth the investment for you, and we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer is higher than Bob's last offer but still below my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while aiming for a higher price.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him, hoping to encourage him to accept. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we aim for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is only $10 below my ideal price and significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer might lead to further negotiation, potentially resulting in a lower price or a lost deal entirely.
* **Time is running out:** With 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk going back and forth with Bob, especially with a guaranteed alternative from John.

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $140, accepting this offer guarantees me a profitable sale with less risk and time investment."
