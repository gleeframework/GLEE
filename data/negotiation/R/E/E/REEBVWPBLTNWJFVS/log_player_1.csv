Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than your minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also positions you to potentially earn a higher profit.  

I've chosen to use a friendly tone in the message to encourage a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $8,800 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I'm hoping to get. I believe I can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $8,800 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $9,200.  This price still reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 9200} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,900. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,900 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my desired $10,000,  it's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob.  Accepting his offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or even a failed deal."
