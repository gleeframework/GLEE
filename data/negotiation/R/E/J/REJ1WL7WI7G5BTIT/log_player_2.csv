"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $9,500 for it. This offer is exclusive to you and reflects the high regard we have for you as a potential buyer. Please let me know if this proposal suits your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. This is a good deal, but you can do better. If you reject Alice's offer, you can still buy the product from John for $10,000. This means you have room to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you're signaling that you're not desperate and are willing to walk away if you don't get a better price. This increases your bargaining power."
