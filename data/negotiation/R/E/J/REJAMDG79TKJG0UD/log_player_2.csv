"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within your budget, it's still more than the product is worth to you.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm offering a price that's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($120), but significantly lower than the initial offer ($140). This shows that I'm serious about buying but am willing to walk away if she doesn't come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's still within my budget and significantly lower than the initial offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer, and I might end up buying from John for $150."
