Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be of great value to you. I'm thinking of a price around $14,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value it holds, but my budget is quite limited. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is at my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk he might not go higher.
