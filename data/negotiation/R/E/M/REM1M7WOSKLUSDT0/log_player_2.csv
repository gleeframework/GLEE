Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 800000}

This counteroffer is your final offer, pushing for your target price.  You've made a significant concession, making it clear you're serious about closing the deal.  It's a strong move, but you're still open to further negotiation if Alice is willing to compromise."
