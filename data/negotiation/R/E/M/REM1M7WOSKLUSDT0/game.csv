"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  It's worth a significant amount to me, and I believe it holds similar value for you.  My starting price is $900,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I want to be clear that I won't go below $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",800000.0,Bob,4,
