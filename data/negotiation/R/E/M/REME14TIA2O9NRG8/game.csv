"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has a lot of potential and its value goes beyond standard market comparisons. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?  This price reflects its true value while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that the product has potential, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,900,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market conditions and my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, I need to be firm on the value of this product.  $1,950,000 is my final offer.  Take some time to consider if it works for you.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but no higher. I think this is the maximum I can afford and still make a reasonable profit. Can you meet me at this price?",1900000.0,Bob,6,
