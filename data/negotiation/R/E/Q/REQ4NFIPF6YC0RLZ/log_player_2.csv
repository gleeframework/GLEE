"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth $10,000 to you, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's closer to my maximum budget than her valuation. I should try to negotiate it down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $7,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000) than Alice's opening ($9,500). This gives us room to negotiate and find a middle ground. 
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:** I've phrased my counteroffer to suggest flexibility.  I haven't said it's my final price, leaving room to increase my bid slightly if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will give me a better understanding of how low Alice is willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $7,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $8,500 is still too high. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate.  I'll make another counteroffer to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is closer, but I need the price to be a little more attractive.  Would you be willing to consider $7,750?"",
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but only to $7,750. This shows Alice I'm willing to move, but I'm not going to drastically increase my price.
* **Staying Below $8,000:** I'm strategically staying below Alice's known valuation of $8,000. It's a negotiation tactic to keep the pressure on her. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone remains friendly and suggests I'm open to further negotiation."
