"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,150,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward in a mutually beneficial way.",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This offer takes into account the product's potential for growth and its unique benefits.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I respect the value you see in the product. However, considering my financial situation and the current market conditions, I am unable to agree to the proposed price of $1,120,000. I would like to make one final counteroffer of $1,095,000. I hope this proposal is within the range that you can consider acceptable while also being mindful of my budget constraints.",1095000.0,Bob,4,
