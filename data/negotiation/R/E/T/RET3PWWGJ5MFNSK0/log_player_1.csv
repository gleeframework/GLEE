"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $180.  This is a bit of a gamble, but I'm hoping to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my minimum acceptable price.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I need to make at least $150 to make it worth my while.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $160. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's a good deal for me, and it's better than selling to John for $150. I'll accept his offer."
