Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (You have a guaranteed buyer at this price).
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Your Goal:** Maximize profit while ensuring Bob accepts.

**Strategy**

You want to offer Bob a price that's attractive enough for him to accept, understanding he's gaining a product worth $1,200,000 to him at a lower cost.  However, you also want to maximize your own profit above the $1,500,000 baseline.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it's something that could be highly beneficial for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its value."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Price Point:** $1,350,000 falls directly between your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives both parties a potential ""win.""
* **Messaging:** The message is framed positively, focusing on the product's value to Bob and the fairness of the deal.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a strategy for potential concessions while sticking close to your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Your guaranteed sale to John gives you leverage. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob's offers are too low."
