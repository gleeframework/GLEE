"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you this unique product for a price that's significantly lower than its true value. I know you're a savvy businessman, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. I'm flexible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm interested in making a deal, but I'm not sure if Alice's offer is the best option. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, I'm hoping she'll be willing to come down in price.

I'll respond with {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and see if she's willing to negotiate further."
