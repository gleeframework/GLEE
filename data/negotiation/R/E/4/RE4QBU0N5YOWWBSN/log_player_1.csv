"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to me is significantly higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price range.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $10,500?  This price is still well below my value for the product, but it gives you a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable accepting it at this point. I'll counter Bob's offer again and try to inch closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $10,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not comfortable accepting $9,800. While it's getting closer, I'm still within the range of rounds to get a better offer from Bob or move on to John. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget limits, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and a fair price for both of us. I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go back to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,000, which would be $9,900. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough choice, but with only two rounds left and Bob not budging much, the risk of getting stuck with a price far below my minimum is too high. I'm confident John will offer me my desired $15,000, so I'll take the guaranteed deal."
