"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to me is significantly higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $10,500?  This price is still well below my value for the product, but it gives you a good deal. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can you consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $10,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. ",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget limits, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and a fair price for both of us. I hope you'll consider it.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go back to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,000, which would be $9,900. Can you consider that price?",9900.0,Bob,8,
