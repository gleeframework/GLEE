"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to make an offer to you at a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests and would allow us to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $850,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value of the product to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in discussing further.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal happen. I'm confident this price is fair considering both our perspectives.",950000.0,Bob,4,
