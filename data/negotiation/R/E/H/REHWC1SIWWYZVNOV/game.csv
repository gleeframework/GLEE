"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not ready to go quite that low. I'm willing to meet you at $128, which is a bit closer to my minimum price. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still be happy with the product.",128.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $125. That's my minimum price, and I'm willing to hold firm. If you're willing to meet me at $125, I'm willing to make it happen.",125.0,Alice,7,
