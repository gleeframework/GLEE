"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a profit significantly higher than my minimum of $80.  I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay at least this much, given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and doesn't reflect the product's value. I'm confident I can get a higher price. I'll proceed to round 3 and counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter with $100. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. I believe this is a fair price that gives both of us a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's only $5 more than selling to John, it's still a profit for me. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether."
