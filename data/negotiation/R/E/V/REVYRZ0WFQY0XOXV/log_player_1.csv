Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $25 markup (from $150 to $175) is a reasonable starting point. It allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value, to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject $175. However, since you have a fallback buyer, you don't lose anything by starting at a higher price."
