"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can go from there.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts on that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
