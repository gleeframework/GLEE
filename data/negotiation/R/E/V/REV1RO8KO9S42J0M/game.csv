"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let me know if you're interested in accepting or making a counteroffer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm only able to offer $950,000 at this time. This is still a significant gain for you, and it aligns with my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still struggling to meet your price. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  This is the absolute maximum I can offer without exceeding my budget.  Let me know if you're open to this compromise.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget constraints while still giving me a decent profit. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
