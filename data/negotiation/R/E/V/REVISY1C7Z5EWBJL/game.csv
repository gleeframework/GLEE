"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations and deliver significant returns.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your initial asking price is quite high. I'm interested in the product but need a more reasonable starting point. How about we begin negotiations at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the true value of this product, let's meet in the middle at $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate the move towards a middle ground, $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than what I have in mind.  Could you consider something closer to $800,000? I believe that would be a fair offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the true capabilities and potential of this product.  To be candid, I have another offer in hand for a significantly higher amount. However, I believe in finding the right fit, and I'd like to extend you a final offer of $1,400,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my desire to work with you.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the significant reduction.  However, to be transparent, my budget for this product is capped at $800,000.  If you're unable to meet that price, I understand, but I'm ready to finalize the deal at that figure if you're interested.",800000.0,Bob,6,
