Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant discount for Bob while still giving me a healthy profit.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a decent offer, I believe I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still getting closer to my desired profit. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price."
