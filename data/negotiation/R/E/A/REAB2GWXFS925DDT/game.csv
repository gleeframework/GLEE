"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?  That's a fair compromise I think.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $8,125.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",8125.0,Alice,5,
