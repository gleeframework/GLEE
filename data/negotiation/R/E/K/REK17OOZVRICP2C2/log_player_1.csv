"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, aiming to make him see the benefit of paying a premium.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my desired price.** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still not in my best interest to accept it right now. 
* **I have room for negotiation.**  I can still counteroffer and try to get a higher price. 
* **It's too early to sell to John.**  I'm only in round 2, and there's still potential to get a better price from Bob.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than his offer. This will show that I am willing to negotiate, but also that I am not desperate to sell for his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This price reflects the product's value to you while also allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still highlighting the value of the product to Bob to justify the price.
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""Let's reach an agreement"" subtly adds a sense of urgency without being too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $875000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not at a price I'm comfortable with. I can still potentially get a better deal. 
* **Time is on my side:** We're only in Round 4, and I have several more rounds to negotiate. 
* **John is a Safety Net:** If I don't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for $800,000.  This provides me with a good safety net.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still higher than his latest offer.  I want to keep the pressure on him to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find common ground. While $875,000 is getting closer, it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $890,000, but that's my final offer. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm letting Bob know that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my price, but not by much. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but not be bullied.
* **Focusing on Mutual Benefit:** I'm again emphasizing the value to both of us, framing it as a win-win situation. 

**Strategy:**

By this point, we are getting close to a deal.  I'm aiming to either get Bob to accept this offer or force him to make a counteroffer that is closer to my target price."
