"Alice, your offer is a bit above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $900000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1000000 is my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at the midpoint, but I need a slight premium for the product's unique features. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1025000.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
