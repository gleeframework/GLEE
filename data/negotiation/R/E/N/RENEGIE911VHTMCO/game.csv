"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $135?  That way we both get a fair deal.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe we can find a price that works for both of us. Could we aim for $128? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a valuable product.",128.0,Bob,4,
