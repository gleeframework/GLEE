"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. I'm very interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. While I'd like to accommodate you, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $10,500. Our product's value aligns closely with its cost, and at $11,500, it represents a fair compromise considering the quality and benefits it offers. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 to move forward with our transaction.",11000.0,Alice,3,
