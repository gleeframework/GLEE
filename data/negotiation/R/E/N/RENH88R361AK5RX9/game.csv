"I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go for $100? That way we both get a good deal.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $102.50. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering.",102.5,Alice,5,
