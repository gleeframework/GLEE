Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation and potential for a higher price. I believe Bob will be motivated to negotiate since the product is worth $10,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I believe I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

I'm offering $8,800. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it's still significantly more than what I could get from John. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle, especially since the product is worth more to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is my minimum price. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'll sell to John for $8,000 to avoid any further delays and ensure I get at least my minimum price."
