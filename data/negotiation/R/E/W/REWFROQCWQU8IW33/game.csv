"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $850000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value I've placed on the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to stay above $800000 to meet my minimum expectations. I can sell the product to you for $825000. This is my final offer in this range.",825000.0,Alice,5,
