"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential for your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a range that might be acceptable considering the value it holds for me.
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to set a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room to negotiate with Bob. I can try to meet him halfway or push for a slightly higher price.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John that's above my minimum.  This gives me a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,550,000. This price still allows for some profit for you and is closer to my minimum value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that is the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I highlight how this price provides potential profit for Bob, emphasizing the win-win aspect.
* **Maintaining firmness:** I'm still above my minimum value, indicating I'm not desperate to sell at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm willing to consider $1,500,000 as a final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **No further gain:** There's no guarantee that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  Further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Equal value:**  John's offer is also $1,500,000.  While there's no risk of losing the sale to John, there's also no upside in selling to him instead of Bob.

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice. It secures my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
