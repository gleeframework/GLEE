"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the market value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $600,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to try and reach an agreement.  This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your offer, $725,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $775,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both trying to make a deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",775000.0,Alice,5,
