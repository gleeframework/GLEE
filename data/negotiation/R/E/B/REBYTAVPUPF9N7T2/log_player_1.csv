{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob values the product at, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** Offering $1,000,000 gives me a good margin for negotiation. I can potentially lower the price a bit if Bob pushes back, but still end up with more than what John is offering.
* **Focusing on Mutual Benefit:** My message emphasizes the ""great deal"" for both of us. This helps create a more collaborative atmosphere and avoids a strictly adversarial negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is too low, it's clear he's willing to negotiate. This gives me an opportunity to push for a higher price.
* **Potential for better outcome:**  I can likely get a better price than $600,000 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $600,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to try and reach an agreement.  This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this price is still a ""great deal"" for Bob, aiming to highlight the value proposition.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $850,000 gives us both some room to compromise.  It's possible that Bob will come up slightly, or I might be willing to come down slightly depending on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,200,000 I can get from John. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob. There's a chance I can get him to come up to a price closer to my target.
* **Avoiding unnecessary loss:**  Selling to Bob at $725,000 would be a significant loss compared to what I can get from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your offer, $725,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $775,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both trying to make a deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a smaller decrease:** This time I'm only decreasing my offer by $75,000.  This shows that I'm getting closer to his price but still holding onto a significant amount of value. 
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is ""fair"" considering the value of the product.  This helps frame the offer as a win-win scenario. 
* **Open to compromise:** My message also mentions that I'm willing to see if we can ""reach an agreement,"" showing that I'm still open to negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

*  Show flexibility without sacrificing too much value
*  Encourage Bob to consider my offer as a good compromise 
*  Keep the negotiation moving forward with the hope of finding a mutually acceptable price."
