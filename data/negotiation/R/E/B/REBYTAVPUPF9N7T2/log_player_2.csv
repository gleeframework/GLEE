Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $600,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to try and reach an agreement.  This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your offer, $725,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $775,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both trying to make a deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $775,000. It's more beneficial for you to buy from John at $800,000 than to continue negotiating and risk a higher final price from Alice."
