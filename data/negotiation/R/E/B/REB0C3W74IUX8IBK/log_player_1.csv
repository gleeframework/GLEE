"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate if Bob rejects. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so I'm aiming high to maximize potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000.  This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal outcome. I'm not willing to settle just yet, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is another compromise, but I'm trying to find a price point that is both acceptable to me and potentially appealing to Bob. I'm hoping that with each round, we are getting closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm not ready to settle yet. I will continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise and very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will recognize that I'm being flexible and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiation isn't moving quickly enough.  Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  With only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John. I'm going to choose to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
