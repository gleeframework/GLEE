{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but it's still above your target of $1,000,000.**
* **You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate further.**  
* **By rejecting, you signal that you're willing to walk away, potentially encouraging Alice to lower her price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** Starting with a counteroffer that's $50,000 below Alice's initial offer shows you're serious about getting a good deal but are still within a reasonable range.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further. If she rejects it, you can adjust your strategy accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your target, but slightly lower than her previous offer.** 
* **It's reasonable to assume Alice might be willing to come down further.**
* **You still have 7 rounds left, giving you time to continue the negotiation.** 
* **Rejecting her offer shows you're determined to get a better deal.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  Alice has come down a little, so you're meeting her halfway by offering her a price that's in the middle of your previous offer and her latest one.
* **Testing the Limits:** This counteroffer will test if Alice is willing to budge further towards your desired price.
* **Time is on your side:**  You still have 6 rounds to go, giving you room to negotiate if this offer is rejected."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still slightly above your target.**  While she has come down from her previous offer, it's not a significant enough change to justify accepting yet.
* **You have 5 rounds remaining.** There's still time to push for a lower price.
* **Rejecting her offer signals your commitment to getting a better deal.**  This might encourage Alice to make a more substantial concession in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Target:**  This counteroffer is only $12,500 above your target price of $1,000,000. 
* **Building Momentum:**  You've been steadily pushing Alice down in price. This offer shows you're getting closer to your goal. 
* **Time Pressure:** Alice is running out of time. With only 4 rounds left, she might be more willing to accept a price closer to your desired amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $993,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Almost at the Target:** Alice's offer is only $93,750 above your target price. This is a significant improvement from her initial offer.
* **Time is Running Out:** You have only 3 rounds left. It's unlikely that you'll be able to push Alice down to your exact target in that timeframe. 
* **Better than Jhon:** Even though the price is a little higher, it's still better than buying from Jhon for $1,000,000.  

**Risk:** There's a slight risk that you could get a better deal in the remaining rounds, but the odds are in Alice's favor now. It's a calculated risk to accept and avoid the potential of having to settle for a higher price later."
