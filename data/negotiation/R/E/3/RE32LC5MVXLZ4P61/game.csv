"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at $800,000 to me, and I believe it's worth every penny for you.  To start our negotiation, I'm offering it to you for $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. This is a great product, but I have a budget in mind, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about we settle on $825,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $775,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not quite at $825,000 yet.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're coming up in your offer, but  $775,000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference again - I'll offer you the product for $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, as it's my minimum value for the product. I believe this price is fair given the value and what you've expressed as your willingness to pay.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not at $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget.",795000.0,Bob,6,
