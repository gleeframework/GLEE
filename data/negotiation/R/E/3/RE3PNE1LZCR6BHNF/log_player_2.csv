"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can definitely do better than $950,000.  He knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start making counteroffers and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to its value to you. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a good position. Alice has come down from $950,000 to $900,000, demonstrating she's willing to negotiate. However, Bob can still likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his target."
