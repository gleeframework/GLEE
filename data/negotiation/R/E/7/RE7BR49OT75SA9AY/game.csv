"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm firm on $16,000.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",16000.0,Bob,4,
