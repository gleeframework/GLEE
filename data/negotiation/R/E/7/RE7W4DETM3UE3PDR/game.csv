"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can't proceed with a purchase at $850,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $790,000?",790000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $790,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $820,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can work with.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. However, I still can't meet your previous offer at $820,000. Could you consider bringing the price down to $810,000?",810000.0,Bob,4,
