Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but  $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
