Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) without pushing him away. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **High Anchor Point:** This initial offer sets a high anchor point, making any subsequent counteroffers from Bob more likely to be closer to your desired price range. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John ($800,000), so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
