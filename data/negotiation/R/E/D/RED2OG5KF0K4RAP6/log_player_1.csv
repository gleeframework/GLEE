"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a steal for a product of this value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still below my minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Confidence:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, aiming to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Openness to negotiation:** The message doesn't close the door to negotiation, allowing Bob to feel comfortable counter-offering. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **Acceptance:**  Great! Deal closed.
* **Counteroffer:** I'll analyze Bob's offer and make a counteroffer based on my remaining time and desire to close the deal.
* **Rejection:**  I'll either consider John's offer or make a lower offer to Bob, but with less wiggle room."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher potential:** While $900,000 is a decent offer, I can likely get closer to my $1,000,000 minimum with continued negotiation.  
* **Time is on my side:** I'm early in the negotiation process, and there are still 8 rounds remaining. 
* **Room for improvement:** Bob's counteroffer indicates a willingness to pay closer to my value. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'll make a counter-offer between $900,000 and $1,000,000, aiming to close the gap and increase my potential earnings."
