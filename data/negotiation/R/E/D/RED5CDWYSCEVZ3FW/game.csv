,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $170 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $130 at this time. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $155? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $140? It's a fair price for us both, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $145? It's still a good deal for me, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
