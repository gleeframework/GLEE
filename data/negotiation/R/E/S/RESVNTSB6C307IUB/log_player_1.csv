Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also willing to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about we aim for $950,000? I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below what it's worth to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still represents a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum value.  Considering the risk of further negotiations and the opportunity cost of potentially losing time with John, I'll accept Bob's offer."
