Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I can tell you're serious about this product. How about we settle at $11,000? This is my final offer.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to a more reasonable price, her ""final offer"" is still above John's price. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed option at $10,000."
