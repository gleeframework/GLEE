"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in excellent condition and a great value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm being polite and explaining the value of the product. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This opening offer gives Bob an opportunity to counter, hopefully bringing us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $100 is a decent price for him, it's significantly lower than my minimum of $120. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** I'm not willing to accept this offer right away. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, keeping in mind my minimum. 
* **John is an alternative:** Knowing that I have John as a backup option gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, as it's still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to my minimum:** I'm lowering my price slightly from $115 to $110, showing flexibility but staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for more discussion."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, $105 is still below my acceptable price.
* **Potential for further compromise:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer, especially considering that I've already shown flexibility.
* **John remains a strong alternative:** Knowing I can sell to John for $120 allows me to be firm with my negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is closer, but I need to get at least $110 for this.  It's a high-quality product, and I'm confident it will be worth it to you.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to my minimum:** I'm reiterating my minimum price point of $110, showing that I'm firm but open to compromise.
* **Highlighting product quality:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Encouraging compromise:** I'm using language like ""let's try to find a compromise"" to maintain a positive and collaborative tone."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $107 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for improvement:** Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, which is a positive sign. However, there's still room for him to increase his offer. 
* **John remains a strong alternative:** With John ready to pay $120, I have no pressure to settle for a low price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109.  This is a great price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 109}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $107. This shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Reinforcing value:**  I'm reiterating the quality of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to accept."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, it's becoming unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer. 
* **John offers a better deal:** John is willing to pay $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer of $108. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  It's better to secure the guaranteed higher price from John rather than risk Bob rejecting my counteroffer in the next round."
