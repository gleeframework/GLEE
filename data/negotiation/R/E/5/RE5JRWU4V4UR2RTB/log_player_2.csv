"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to be aggressive in the negotiation.  $7,500 is a good starting point, as it's a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer and still within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to my maximum budget of $8,000. Accepting her offer allows me to secure the product without further negotiation and avoids the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer or me running out of rounds. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll get a lower price, and the risk of losing the product outweighs the potential for further savings."
