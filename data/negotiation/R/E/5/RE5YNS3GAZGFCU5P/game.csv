"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $85 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit out of your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $95. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still a little over my budget.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm sure we can find a solution.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $92. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for the value the product brings. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $88.  This is the most I can offer, so let's see if we can close the deal.",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $88 is the most you can offer, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $91. It's the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",91.0,Alice,7,
