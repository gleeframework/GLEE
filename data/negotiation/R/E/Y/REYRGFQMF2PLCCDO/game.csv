"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still above my target price.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value of $800,000 and my maximum value of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your target price range. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $875,000. This leaves us both with a good profit margin and gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your proposal, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product for $885,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
