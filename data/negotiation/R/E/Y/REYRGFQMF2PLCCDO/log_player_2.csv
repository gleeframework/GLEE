"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's a good starting point, but there's significant room for negotiation to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start making counteroffers and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still above my target price.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value of $800,000 and my maximum value of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your target price range. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer keeps the opportunity open to potentially save more money. Bob can continue to counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to his target of $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $875,000. This leaves us both with a good profit margin and gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your proposal, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product for $885,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $875,000.  It's a good deal for Bob, considering he's willing to pay up to $1,200,000.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's within his target range and significantly less than buying from John.  There's a good chance that further negotiation might get the price lower, but there's also the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer or Bob running out of rounds.  It's a smart move to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
