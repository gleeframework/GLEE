{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,400,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still $100,000 of potential profit for Bob, making him likely to engage in the negotiation. 
* **It shows you're serious about a deal:**  A firm offer shows Bob that you're not just playing games and that you're genuinely interested in selling to him.

**Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response.** If he rejects, you can lower the price slightly or offer him incentives.  However, be prepared to walk away if the negotiations drag on or if you feel the price is too low for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $1350000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still above your minimum, it's significantly lower than your initial offer.  You want to maximize your profits and there's still potential to get closer to your desired price. By rejecting his offer, you can counter with a price closer to your initial offer and see if you can bridge the gap. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than your initial offer, perhaps $1,375,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable deal. You can also try to understand Bob's reasons for rejecting your initial offer and tailor your counteroffer accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,350,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000.  This still offers you a great value, and it allows me to move closer to my desired price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to be flexible and find a middle ground.
* **Value Proposition:** You reiterate the value the product offers Bob to encourage him to consider the price.
* **Clear and Direct:** This message is straightforward and doesn't waste time with unnecessary details.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, you can adjust your strategy. If he rejects, you might need to consider lowering your price further or explore other options. However, remember to stay firm on your bottom line and be prepared to walk away if the deal doesn't meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose $1360000 as a potential compromise. I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,360,000 is only $15,000 lower than your last offer of $1,375,000.  This is a very small difference, and accepting his offer would mean securing a sale at a price that's still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  

It's important to consider the following:

* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, potentially leading to a stalemate or even the loss of the deal.
* **Potential for Further Reductions:** There's a chance Bob might continue to lower his offer in future rounds.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $1,200,000 is a guaranteed sale, Bob's offer is only $40,000 less than that, making it a relatively close call.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic option. It minimizes the risk of further negotiation and secures a profitable deal."
