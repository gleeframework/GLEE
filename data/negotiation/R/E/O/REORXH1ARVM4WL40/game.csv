"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential savings for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits you'll gain from it.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer $880,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking $910,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits you'll gain from it.",910000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $910,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $890,000.  This is a final offer from my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",890000.0,Bob,6,
