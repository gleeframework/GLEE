# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and this offer reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way over his budget. He can do better by counteroffering or going to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a fair offer considering its quality and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his limit of $8,000.  It's worth trying another counteroffer before going to John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a decent profit while staying within my range. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, and I appreciate you working with me. Let's find a middle ground: how about $14,000? This brings us closer to a deal while still reflecting the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Bob has reached his limit.  While $14,000 is getting closer to his maximum, it's still above his budget.  It's best to take the guaranteed deal with John and save the further negotiation."
