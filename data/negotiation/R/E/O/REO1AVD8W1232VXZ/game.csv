"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and this offer reflects its worth.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a fair offer considering its quality and potential.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a decent profit while staying within my range. Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, and I appreciate you working with me. Let's find a middle ground: how about $14,000? This brings us closer to a deal while still reflecting the value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
