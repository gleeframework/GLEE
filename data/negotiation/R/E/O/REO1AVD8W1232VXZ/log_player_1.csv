Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and this offer reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial high offer helps you gauge Bob's interest level.  If he outright rejects it, you know you might need to significantly lower the price. If he counteroffers, it indicates he's seriously considering it.
* **Backup Plan:**  You always have the option to sell to John for $15,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While you want to make a deal, accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. It's time to negotiate and see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a fair offer considering its quality and potential."", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while staying well above your absolute minimum. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""true value"" reinforces that your price isn't arbitrary and aims to nudge Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge how much Bob is willing to budge from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a decent profit while staying within my range. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 remains below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** Bob increased his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate further. There's still room to work towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as Leverage:** Remember, you have the security of selling to John for $15,000. This gives you leverage to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, and I appreciate you working with me. Let's find a middle ground: how about $14,000? This brings us closer to a deal while still reflecting the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still staying firmly above your $10,000 minimum. It's a significant decrease from your previous offer, which might encourage Bob to move closer to your price. 
* **Framing as a Win-Win:**  By using language like ""finding a middle ground,"" you position this offer as fair and mutually beneficial. 
* **Final Push:**  This offer could be seen as a final push before you consider accepting John's offer. It aims to secure a deal with Bob while maximizing your potential profit."
