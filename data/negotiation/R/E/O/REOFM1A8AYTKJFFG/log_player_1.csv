Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for a profit beyond your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It shows your willingness to negotiate:**  By not starting at the highest possible price, you signal a willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  Bob is clearly interested, and his counteroffer shows that he is willing to pay more than my absolute minimum.  Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer allows me to keep pushing for a price closer to my target of $1,450,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My previous offer was $1,450,000, and Bob countered at $1,300,000. This counteroffer of $1,400,000  meets him halfway, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining a reasonable margin:**  $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring I make a good profit. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  While I'm willing to come down slightly, I'm still not giving away the farm. There's still room for Bob to come up a bit if he wants to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** While $1,350,000 is a bit lower than my initial desired price, it's still a good profit margin and a significant amount of money.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  I've already made a few concessions, and pushing for a higher price might risk losing Bob completely. 
* **Potential for a deal:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,350,000, which is a good price, and there's a strong likelihood we can finalize the deal.

At this point, it's more beneficial to secure a good deal with Bob than to risk losing him and having to accept John's offer, which is significantly lower."
