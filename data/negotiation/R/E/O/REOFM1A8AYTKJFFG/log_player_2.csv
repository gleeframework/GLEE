**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still a reasonable price. It leaves room for further negotiation while also making it clear that you are serious about buying the product. Since Alice is willing to sell for $1,200,000, there is a good chance she will accept a price closer to your counteroffer."

This counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between Alice's last offer and your previous one. It shows that you're willing to negotiate but are still aiming for a good price.  Since Alice is willing to sell for $1,200,000, a price of $1,350,000 could be acceptable to her, especially if she wants to close the deal."
