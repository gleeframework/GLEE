"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our exclusive product. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a price of $750,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a one-time opportunity to get your hands on a product that's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $750,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $700,000. I can offer you a price of $725,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
