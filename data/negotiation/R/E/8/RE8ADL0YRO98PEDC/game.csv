"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I can afford right now. Would you consider $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
