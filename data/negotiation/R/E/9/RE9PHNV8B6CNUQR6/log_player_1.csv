Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $80, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if he tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies scarcity (""limited time"") and value (""great deal"") to make the price more palatable.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps you gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay more than the minimum. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response. If he outright rejects it, you can always counter-offer with a lower price, moving closer to your minimum acceptable amount."
