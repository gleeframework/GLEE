"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is tempting, I'm hoping for a bit closer to my initial offer. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This allows both of us to get a good deal. ",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $9,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced that $10,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,6,
