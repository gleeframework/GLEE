"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for something worth a lot to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm being friendly and enthusiastic to create a good rapport with Bob.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to me, subtly suggesting it's a good deal for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and set the stage for further negotiation. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and my remaining rounds. If he accepts, I've made a decent profit, but I'll always have the option of going to John if a better deal presents itself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's a good offer, it's still below the $15,000 value I can get from John.
* **There are still rounds left to negotiate.**  Rejecting Bob's offer doesn't mean ending the deal. I can counteroffer and potentially reach a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, but still lower than my minimum. I want to explore if there's room for compromise without settling for a price that doesn't meet my goals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is tempting, I'm hoping for a bit closer to my initial offer. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This allows both of us to get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with a compromise:**  Instead of going back to my initial $12,000, I'm suggesting a middle ground. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterate the value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product to me, making him feel like this price is fair for both parties. 
* **Positive and encouraging:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation flowing smoothly.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price.  If he's still not willing to budge, I have another round to either offer a further compromise or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's closer to my desired range, it's still not a good enough deal for me, especially considering I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price.
* **There are still several rounds left to negotiate.** I don't want to rush into a deal that doesn't benefit me.  I'll continue to explore if there's room for a higher offer from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer again, attempting to find a compromise that's closer to my minimum price. However, if Bob continues to refuse, I'll be prepared to move on to John in the next round.  This strategy allows me to maximize my chances of getting a good price while also protecting myself from losing too much money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $9,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm making a final concession, lowering my price to $10,000. This is still above Bob's last offer, but it shows a commitment to finding a solution.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the value of the product to me, subtly pressuring him to reconsider.
* **Open-ended question:** Asking ""What do you say?"" encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a last-ditch effort to secure a deal with Bob that meets my minimum requirements. If he rejects this offer, I will be prepared to move on to John in the next round. This approach balances my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $10,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited negotiation rounds:** We're nearing the end of our rounds, and Bob's offers are stubbornly refusing to go above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $15,000, which is significantly higher than any offer Bob has made.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses.  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result, and I'm risking losing the opportunity to sell to John for a much higher price. It's a strategic decision to prioritize a guaranteed profit over the possibility of a slightly better price from Bob."
