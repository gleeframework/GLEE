"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm interested in the product, and I'm prepared to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is significantly below the value of this product.  To make this work for me, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1300000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1150000?  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
