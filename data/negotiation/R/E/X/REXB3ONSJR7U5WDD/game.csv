"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me, as I'm confident in the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50?  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a fair price.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good product, Alice, and I'm definitely still interested. How about $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to be flexible.  $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
