Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me, as I'm confident in the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50?  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 102.50}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to be flexible.  $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
