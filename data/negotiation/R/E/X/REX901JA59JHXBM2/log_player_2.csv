"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to work towards a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects its value and allows for a fair profit for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. I've offered a price that's still within my budget but leaves room for further negotiation.  This initial counteroffer sets the stage for a back-and-forth process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point. I'm still within the early rounds, and I want to see if I can push for a lower price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,500,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Alice's most recent offer.  This demonstrates my willingness to meet halfway while still achieving my goal of purchasing the product at my maximum budget."
