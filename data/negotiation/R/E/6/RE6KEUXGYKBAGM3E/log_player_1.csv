Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a sale.  Here's why:

* **It's above my minimum:**  $10,000 is significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000.
* **It's within Bob's range:**  $10,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $12,000 to him.
* **It reduces risk:**  While I could aim for a higher price, the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and leaving me with only $8,000 from John is too high."
