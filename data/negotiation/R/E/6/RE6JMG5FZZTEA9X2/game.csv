"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. This is my final offer for now.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $1200000 is simply too low considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000.  This price allows for a substantial profit for you and ensures a fair deal for me. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet at $1200000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your commitment.  However, $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try $1350000.  This is a final compromise from my end.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
