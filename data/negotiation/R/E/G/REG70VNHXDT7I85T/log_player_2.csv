"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  It's also a good idea to keep the option of buying from John open as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a strong opening counteroffer, aiming to get Alice to consider a price closer to Bob's maximum budget.  It's important to be aggressive in the first counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above it. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. Also, Bob still has the option to buy from John for $10,000 if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now closer to his maximum budget and wants to see if he can meet Alice halfway.  Offering $10,500 is a reasonable compromise, indicating Bob's willingness to negotiate but still keeping the price lower than John's offer. This counteroffer might be attractive to Alice, who is likely to want to close the deal, but needs to consider whether she's willing to go lower than $11,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is now at Bob's maximum budget.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating and try to get an even lower price, it's highly unlikely that Alice will go lower than $10,500.  Therefore, Bob is better off taking the guaranteed deal with John for $10,000, ensuring he doesn't overpay and achieves his goal of saving money."
