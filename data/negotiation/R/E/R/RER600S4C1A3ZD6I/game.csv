"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd be happy to sell it to you for $155. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's try $145.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
