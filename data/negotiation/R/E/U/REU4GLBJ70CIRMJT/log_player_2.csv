"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. $5,000 is a very good price, but there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and I want to see if I can get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $3,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer, and it's a price I'd be happy with if I can secure it. I'm aiming to see how much wiggle room there is before considering buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $4,000 is a good price, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal. It's still early in the negotiation, and I want to see if I can push Alice closer to my desired price point of $3,000.  Buying from John for $12,000 is a last resort, and I'm not there yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $3,500.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm still holding firm on getting a good deal. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to move, but also that I'm not going to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $4,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. It's still early in the negotiation, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a better price.  Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still room for a compromise.  Buying from John for $12,000 is a last resort, and I'm not prepared to take that step yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $4,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about making a deal.  I'm still hoping to get the price lower, but I'm also mindful that I might not be able to get it down to my ideal $3,500.  It's a calculated risk, but I believe this offer will be more appealing to Alice than my previous one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price point, and we're running out of time.  There's only a small gap between my last offer and her counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice.  It's also getting risky to keep going back and forth, as I'm running out of rounds to close a deal. Accepting her offer is a smart decision, allowing me to secure the product for a decent price without risking a complete breakdown in negotiations."
