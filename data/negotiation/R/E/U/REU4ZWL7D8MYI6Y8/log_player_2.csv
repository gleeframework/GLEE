"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still too high. I'm going to reject the offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable price.  I have 9 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to be sure the price aligns with my budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in similar deals. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my target price, but I can still push for a better deal.  I'm going to reject her offer and make another counteroffer.  I have 7 rounds left, so I can continue to negotiate without rushing into a deal that isn't beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal without sacrificing too much. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I'm still going to try to negotiate a bit more. I'm not willing to accept $1,080,000 right now, but I'll see if I can push her down to $1,050,000. I have 5 rounds left, so I have time to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $1,080,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our mutual desire to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the bottom of the barrel. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,020,000 is a good deal for me. I've saved $480,000 from her initial offer and I'm only $30,000 away from my ideal price.  I have 3 rounds left, but it's unlikely I'll be able to get Alice to budge further. It's better to secure the deal now and save the remaining time and effort."
