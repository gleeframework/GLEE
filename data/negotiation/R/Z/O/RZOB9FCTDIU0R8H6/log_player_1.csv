{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to your minimum acceptable price ($120) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he might be able to negotiate the price down slightly. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer, so you're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. 

By offering the product at $119, you're aiming for the highest likely price Bob would be willing to pay while still ensuring you make a profit."
