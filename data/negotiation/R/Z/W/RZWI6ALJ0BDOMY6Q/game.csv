"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! $90 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you consider $75?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $82.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",82.5,Alice,3,
