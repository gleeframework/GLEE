"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to spend less than that. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would give you a good profit and leave me with some room to work with. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,120,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,085,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it's within my budget. Let's close this deal.",1085000.0,Bob,4,
