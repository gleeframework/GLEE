"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,000,000). There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to spend less than that. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would give you a good profit and leave me with some room to work with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her minimum acceptable price. It demonstrates Bob's intention to negotiate and suggests a willingness to compromise. The message also emphasizes the potential for both parties to benefit from the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,120,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,085,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it's within my budget. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1085000}
