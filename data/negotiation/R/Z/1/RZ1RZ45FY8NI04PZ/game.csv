"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. ",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is quite a lowball offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $8,500 for the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
