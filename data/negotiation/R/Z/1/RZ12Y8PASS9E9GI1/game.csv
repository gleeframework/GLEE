"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to  $700,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? I feel that's a fair offer that reflects the value it holds for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
