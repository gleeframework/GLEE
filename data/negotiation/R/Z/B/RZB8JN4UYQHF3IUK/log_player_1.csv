"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening offer that gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It also sets the tone that I believe this product is valuable and I'm not going to undervalue it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for higher. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still trying to get a good price. Hopefully, Bob sees this as a reasonable middle ground and agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is close to John's offer, I still think I can do better with Bob. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating.  It's getting late in the game, but I'm not giving up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $900,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and I'm hoping it's enough to secure a deal before I have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has come down to $800,000, which is the same as what John is offering. At this point, there's no room for negotiation with Bob. Since I have a guaranteed sale with John for the same price, it's best to cut my losses and sell to John.  The time pressure is too great to continue this back and forth."
