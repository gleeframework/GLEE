"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer starts the negotiation at a price point significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer and propose a counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle at $9,750? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,250?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely I'll get a price significantly lower than $10,250.  Accepting this offer secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
