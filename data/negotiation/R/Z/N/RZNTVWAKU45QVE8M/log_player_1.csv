"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The  $1,300,000 offer is closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) while still significantly above my minimum ($800,000).
* **Open Communication:**  The message invites Bob's input, fostering a collaborative negotiation atmosphere. 

This strategy seeks to maximize profit while remaining open to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a substantial profit, it's still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value and my initial offer. Rejecting keeps the negotiation alive, allowing me to push for a better deal in the next round. I'm willing to take a calculated risk, as I believe Bob is genuinely interested and there's room for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While I value the product highly, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($1,000,000) and my previous price ($1,300,000).
* **Show Flexibility:** This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Maintain Value:**  The message reinforces the product's value while justifying the counteroffer.

By making a significant concession but remaining firm on a price above my minimum, I aim to encourage Bob towards a final agreement in the upcoming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,100,000 represents a significant profit margin above my minimum price ($800,000).
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations further risks losing Bob's interest.  It's better to secure a good deal now. 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the sale and settling for John's offer isn't worth the potential gain. Accepting $1,100,000 secures a substantial profit and a successful negotiation."
