"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $11,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,500, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $9,750? That's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but $9,750 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $10,200, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, but I'm not quite ready to meet at $10,000. I can do $10,300, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to meet me a little closer. How about $10,100?",10100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go much higher than $10,100, but I can meet you at $10,150. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10150.0,Alice,9,
