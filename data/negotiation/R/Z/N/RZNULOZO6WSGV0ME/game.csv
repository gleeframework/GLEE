"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I receive a fair price for this product. Let's try a middle ground -  I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This gives you a good deal while ensuring I get a reasonable return.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - I'll offer $1,250,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any higher.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
