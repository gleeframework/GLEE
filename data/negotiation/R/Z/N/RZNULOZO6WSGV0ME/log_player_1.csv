Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this price is fair considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer, as I am aiming to get a higher price for the product. I still have 8 rounds left and can potentially negotiate a better deal. Selling to John at this point would be settling for the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I want to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I receive a fair price for this product. Let's try a middle ground -  I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This gives you a good deal while ensuring I get a reasonable return."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - I'll offer $1,250,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,250,000 is a good deal considering the value of the product to Bob.  We're nearing the halfway point of our negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
