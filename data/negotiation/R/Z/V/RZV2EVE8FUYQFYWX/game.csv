"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product with my business expertise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking to make a deal, but $950000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with the value you can bring to it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I still think $1050000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I can bring to the product while also being mindful of the value you've placed on it.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, but $980000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value you've placed on the product and the fact that we're in the middle of our negotiation, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1020000. This is my best and final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I appreciate your willingness to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $990000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1040000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best price I can offer considering the value of the product.",1040000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1040000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $985000 for the product.
