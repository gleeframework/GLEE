"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get it closer to my budget.  How about $10,500?  That leaves us both with a little room to breathe.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,800 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go to $10,600. That's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,700. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",10700.0,Alice,5,
