"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer and counteroffer. You can likely get a better deal, as the product is worth more to you ($150) than it is to Alice ($120)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! However, $130 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $135, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best option. You'll save $15 compared to buying from John, and you're still getting a good deal as the product is worth $150 to you.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John is higher than the potential savings."
