Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and constraints:

```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring Alice a significant profit above her minimum.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** Offering it for the full $1,500,000 might be too risky, as Bob could easily reject it and go with another option.  This offer represents a strong starting point that is still very advantageous to Alice."
