{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob at $100, which is a good starting point. This is a price that is higher than my minimum value of $80 but lower than the product's worth to Bob ($120). This gives Bob room to negotiate and potentially counter-offer, while also ensuring I earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I am looking for a price closer to $80. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is higher than my minimum of $80 and is a good compromise. I can accept his offer and secure a sale without needing to further negotiate."
