"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $14000? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try to find a sweet spot. How about $13000? It's a bit higher than your previous offer, but I'm confident you'll love the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $13000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about $12500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you halfway from $12500, so how about $13250? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $13250 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $12250?",12250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to drive a hard bargain, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12250. I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's meet in the middle at $13000, but I need to make it clear that this is my absolute final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,9,
