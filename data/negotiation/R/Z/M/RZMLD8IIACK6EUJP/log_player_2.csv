"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,000. It's a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $5,500?"",
""product_price"": 5500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($5,500) to leave room for negotiation and try to secure the best possible price. 
* **Polite and Positive:** The message remains courteous and expresses continued interest in the product. 
* **Target Price:**  My goal is to pay significantly less than $7,000, ideally closer to $6,000 if possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $6,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to my desired price range, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to meet her somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle on $6,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm aiming for the midpoint between her last offer ($6,500) and my previous offer ($5,500). 
* **Clear Target:** This counteroffer firmly establishes my desired price point while still leaving some room for minor adjustments if needed. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation rounds, so it's a good time to nudge towards a final decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $6,000, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'm offering the product to you for $6,250. It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $6,250 is a significant discount from Alice's original offer and only slightly above my target price. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation is unlikely to result in substantial savings and might irritate Alice.
* **Time Value:** Continuing the negotiation for a potentially small gain isn't worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
