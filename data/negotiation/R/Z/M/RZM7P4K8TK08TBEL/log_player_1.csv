I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get at least $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with him and lose more time. I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,200,000. It's not my ideal price, but it guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable value."
