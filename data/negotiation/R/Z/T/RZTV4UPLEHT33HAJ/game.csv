,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice! However, $125 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $115? I think that's as low as I can go and still make it worth my while.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $115. How about we try $112.50?",112.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $113, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll accept your offer.",113.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $112, but that's my absolute limit. If you're willing to accept, I'll take the deal.",112.0,Bob,8,
