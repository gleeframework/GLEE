"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $105? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $107.50 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference again and try $106.25.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",106.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $106.25. I'm willing to come down another $0.75, so how about we meet at $106.50? It's still a good price for both of us.",106.5,Alice,5,
