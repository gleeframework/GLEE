"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $80 to you, and Alice's offer is $90, it's not in your best interest to accept. You have 10 rounds and the option to go to John, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested but $90 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 75} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $85.  It's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $85 is still more than what the product is worth to you. You can likely get a better price with a counteroffer, and you still have several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $85 is still a bit high. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? I'm eager to get this product but need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
