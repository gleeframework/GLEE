"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,
