"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your value and well above my minimum.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my original offer.  I'm offering you the product for $10,500.  This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.  Let's see if we can make this work.
