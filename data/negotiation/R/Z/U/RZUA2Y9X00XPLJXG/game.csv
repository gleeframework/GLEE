"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your value and well above my minimum.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my original offer.  I'm offering you the product for $10,500.  This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
