"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to get the price closer to his target of $1,000,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me at this moment. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. I could consider coming down to $1,300,000.  This is a very competitive price for what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, Bob can still get a better deal.  His target is $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is still too high.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $1,250,000. This is a fair price given my budget and the product's value. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
