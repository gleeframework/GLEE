"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer helps gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. It leaves room to increase the offer gradually while staying well below John's $8,000 backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met your backup price. There's no point in negotiating further as you won't get a better deal from John."
