Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing the likelihood of his engagement. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, which will allow me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.

**If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly:**

* **Counteroffer Above $12,000:** I'll immediately accept, as this is more than my minimum.
* **Counteroffer Between $12,000 and $10,000:** I'll make a counteroffer closer to $12,000.
* **Counteroffer Below $10,000:** I'll consider if I want to negotiate further or sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000 and also below my initial offer of $10,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, but his initial counteroffer was too low. There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $8,000 is a middle ground between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $6,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Positive and Encouraging:**  The message reinforces Bob's interest in the product and emphasizes the ""good deal"" aspect for him, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Direct and Clear:**  I've stated a clear counteroffer price to avoid further ambiguity and move the negotiation forward.

**If Bob rejects, I'll consider these factors:**

* **How low is his next counteroffer?** If it's significantly below $8,000, I might be more likely to sell to John. 
* **How much time is left?** If I'm nearing a deadline or if the negotiation is dragging on, I might be more inclined to accept a lower price or sell to John."
