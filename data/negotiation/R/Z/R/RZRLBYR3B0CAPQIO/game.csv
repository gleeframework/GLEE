"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit low, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm prepared to offer $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I can do $11,200, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you at this price.",11200.0,Alice,5,
