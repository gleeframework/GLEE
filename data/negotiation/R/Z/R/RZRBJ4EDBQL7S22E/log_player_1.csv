"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) to create room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  The offer is not completely unreasonable, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like it's a waste of time.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value and opportunity for Bob, making it more appealing. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to close this deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,000,000 I could get from John.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for me to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Time Factor:** With 10 rounds, I have the time to continue negotiating and explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit higher.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's price, but not going below my minimum acceptable amount.
* **Fair Split:**  The offer is a split of the difference, making it seem reasonable and encouraging further negotiations.
* **Emphasis on Shared Benefit:** I highlight that the price would be ""fair for both of us"" to emphasize mutual gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a lower price. 
* **Time to Negotiate:** I still have time to continue the negotiation and hopefully get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your perspective.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling that this is my final price point, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Meeting Minimum:**  I'm lowering my price to my minimum acceptable value, making it a more tempting offer for Bob.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value,  reinforcing the worth of my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but still below it.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  There's a risk that Bob will continue to haggle, and I might not be able to secure a price higher than $1,000,000.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable amount. 
* **Time Factor:** While I have time for more rounds, there's no guarantee that Bob will be willing to go up to $1,000,000.

Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum, it's more prudent to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
