Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium above that.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Depending on Bob's response, I might be open to lowering the price slightly to secure the deal, but never going below my safety net of $15,000."
