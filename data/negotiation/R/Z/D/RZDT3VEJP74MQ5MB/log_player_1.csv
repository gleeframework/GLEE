Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer gives Bob a good deal, as he values the product at $15,000, but still allows me to make a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still believe the product is worth more than $13,000. This counteroffer offers a middle ground, allowing for a continued negotiation with Bob while still earning a profit closer to my initial desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,800 is only slightly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit, and continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the deal entirely."
