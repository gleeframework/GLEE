Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum price, as I know John will buy it for that amount. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet my price, or if he'll counteroffer. If he counters, I'll evaluate his offer and decide whether to accept, counter, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial price, but still staying above my minimum. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to meet my price, and it's becoming clear that I'm unlikely to get closer to my desired price. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale to John."
