{""product_price"": 7500}

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her initial offer. While it's tempting to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $7,500. I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

**Explanation:**

I'm making a final counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to get closer to Alice's price. If Alice rejects this, I will buy from John."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting too close to my maximum budget. I've already made several counteroffers and haven't seen much movement from Alice. It's clear that I'm unlikely to get a better deal with Alice. Therefore, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $10,000 to ensure I get the product within my budget."
