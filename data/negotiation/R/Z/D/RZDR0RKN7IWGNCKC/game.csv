"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I can't disclose the specifics just yet, I'm confident it has the potential to be extremely beneficial for you. My asking price is $1500000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's potential. I'm open to discussing it further if you'd like. However, if you're not interested, I'll be moving on to another buyer.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
