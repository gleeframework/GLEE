Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a slight discount from $160, but not all the way down to $140. How about we meet at $155? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $155 is still above my budget of $120. I've already made a few counteroffers and it seems like we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to get her down to $120. At this point, it's safer to go with the guaranteed price from John and buy the product from him."
