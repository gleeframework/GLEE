"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $130. This is a good price, but you can try to get it for even less."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

Alice's offer of $120 is still within your budget and a good deal.  There's a chance you could get it lower, but there's also a chance she'll stick to her price or you'll end up buying from John for $150.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it."
