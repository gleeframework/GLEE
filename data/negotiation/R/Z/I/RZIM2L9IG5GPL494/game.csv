"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $75?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is a great fit for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about $80?  I'm sure we can agree on that price.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a great price, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $81.25. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. Let me know if you're interested.",81.25,Alice,5,
