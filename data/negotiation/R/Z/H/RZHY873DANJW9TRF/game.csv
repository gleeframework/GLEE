"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a more budget-friendly range. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $1,250,000 for the product. Can we discuss this further?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and finding a middle ground is important. However,  $1,250,000 is quite a distance from what I had in mind. Let's try this: how about $2,000,000? This acknowledges the value it brings while also being a significant move on my initial price.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate the compromise. However, $2,000,000 is still above my target price. Considering the value you mentioned, I'm willing to meet you at $1,800,000. Can we find a mutually beneficial agreement?",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $1,800,000 is getting closer, but I'm still seeking a figure that reflects its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?  This shows my willingness to compromise while ensuring a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
