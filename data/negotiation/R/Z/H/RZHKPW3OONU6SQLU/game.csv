"I'm not willing to go as low as $13000, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $13500, which is still a discount from the original price. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free warranty and a premium support package. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",13500.0,Alice,5,
