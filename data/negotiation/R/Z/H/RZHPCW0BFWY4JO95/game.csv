"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your offer, but $20,000 is still too high. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. That's a fair price considering the value this product offers.  What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Would you be willing to accept that price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $12,500 is a bit too low for me to make this work. I can do $14,000, and that's my final offer.  It's a fantastic deal for this product. Let me know if you're interested.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12,000",13000.0,Bob,6,
