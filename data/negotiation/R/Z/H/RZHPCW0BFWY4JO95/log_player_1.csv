Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at $20,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000} 
 
Let's see how Bob responds and we can negotiate from there. Keep in mind, I'm aiming to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but I'm willing to see if I can get more from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and even my initial offer. While I want to get the best price, dragging this out might not be the best strategy.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will aim to meet somewhere in the middle, but be prepared to walk away if he doesn't budge enough.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your offer, but $20,000 is still too high. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. That's a fair price considering the value this product offers.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17000} 
 
I'm coming down significantly, but still leaving room for negotiation. It's a balancing act between getting a good price and not losing Bob entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tricky spot. Bob is inching closer, but he's still below my minimum. I need to decide if I want to try one more time or take the guaranteed $15,000 from John. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll give Bob one more chance to meet closer to my needs. If he's not there, I'm going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $12,500 is a bit too low for me to make this work. I can do $14,000, and that's my final offer.  It's a fantastic deal for this product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}

I'm holding firm close to my minimum.  This offer is a strong signal that I'm serious about selling at a reasonable price, but not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's bluff about John offering $12,000 doesn't change the situation; it's likely a tactic to pressure me.  $13,000 is below my minimum, and I'm done negotiating. 

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

It's time to move on. John is offering a fair price, and I'm not going to continue haggling with Bob when I have a guaranteed sale at a better price."
