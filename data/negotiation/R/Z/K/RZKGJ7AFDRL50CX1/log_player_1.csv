Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that amount as possible. I'll offer it to him for $750,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept. Since I can sell the product to John for $800,000, I'll choose option 3 and sell the product to John.
