"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is quite a bit below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000. This is a significant investment for you, but I'm confident it will pay off.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
