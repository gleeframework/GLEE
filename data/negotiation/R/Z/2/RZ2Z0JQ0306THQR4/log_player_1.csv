Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $150 is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation and gives me a chance to get a higher price than my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and optimistic, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Mentioning that the product is ""fantastic"" suggests it's worth the price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a calculated risk by starting high.  If Bob immediately rejects, I can either lower the price slightly or move on to John. If Bob makes a counteroffer, I'll use that information to gauge his interest and decide whether to accept, counter, or walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $120, which is my minimum value.
* **Potential for More:**  Bob's offer is my minimum. There's potential that I can get a higher price if I counteroffer.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a compromise.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while also trying to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $135? It's still a great price for this amazing product!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered the price to $135, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This is a reasonable compromise given my minimum value and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and encouraging tone, showing I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value by calling it ""amazing."" This reminds Bob of the product's worth and why it's worth paying a bit more.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is strategic in that it:

* **Keeps the negotiation moving forward:** By making a counteroffer, I'm avoiding a stalemate and maintaining the opportunity to reach a deal. 
* **Positions me for a good outcome:**  If Bob accepts, I get a better price than my minimum. If Bob counters again, I'll have more information to decide my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm still hoping to find a way to keep it under $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Room for Negotiation:** Bob is firm on his $120 price, which is my absolute minimum.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a higher price.
* **Time is Money:**  I've already invested time and energy in negotiating with Bob.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum price.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him rejecting further offers, potentially leaving me with no sale.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John is the most efficient and risk-free option. It ensures I receive my minimum value for the product without further negotiation."
