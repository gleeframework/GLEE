"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to invest less, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $950000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great opportunity.
