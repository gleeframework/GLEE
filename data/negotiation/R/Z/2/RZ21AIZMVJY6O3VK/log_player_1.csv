Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts, as I'm eager to see this product put to good use."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While John guarantees $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below Bob's perceived value ($800,000) might seem like a good deal to him, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is open for discussion. If Bob counters, Alice can still negotiate up to a price closer to $1,200,000.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob immediately might be preferable even at a slightly lower price than waiting for John, as it provides immediate capital.

This strategy balances risk and potential reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
