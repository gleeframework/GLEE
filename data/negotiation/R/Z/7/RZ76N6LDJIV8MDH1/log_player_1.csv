``` 

This offer starts at a price that is a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price will be attractive to Bob, while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but I'm only able to go up to $10,500 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it's worth pursuing a counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10,500 is lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still only able to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, considering your asking price and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than my ideal price, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Accepting his offer allows me to sell the product without further negotiation, and I'll still be able to make a decent profit."
