"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While the product looks great, $900000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $875000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $825000, which is a significant discount from your original offer.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident that this price will be fair for both of us.  Let's work together to get this deal done.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
