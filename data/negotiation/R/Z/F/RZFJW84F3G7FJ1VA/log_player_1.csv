Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you want to aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle above your minimum.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning another interested buyer (John, in this case) creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to get you the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring you don't miss out on a sale."
