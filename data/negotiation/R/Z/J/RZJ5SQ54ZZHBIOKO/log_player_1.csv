"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle that's still very profitable for you.
* **Professional and Open Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and expressing openness to discussion. This encourages a collaborative negotiation rather than an adversarial one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product has potential, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below your target price and even below the product's worth to him ($1,500,000). It's early in the negotiation, and you have room to counter. Selling to John right now would mean missing out on a potential profit of $400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm (For Now):**  While acknowledging Bob's counteroffer, you're signaling that you're not willing to drop to his initial price point. The significant decrease from your initial offer shows you're willing to negotiate, but the $1,300,000 mark sets a firm boundary.
* **Justification:**  By reiterating the product's value, you're reminding Bob of why he's interested and subtly anchoring the negotiation around a higher number.
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" helps to maintain a positive tone and suggests you're looking for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is closer, but still a touch high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,200,000 is a $200,000 profit over your minimum and a good return on your investment.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer to ""meet in the middle"" suggests he's getting close to his maximum price. Pushing further might make him walk away.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Every round that passes represents a potential delay in closing the deal. Accepting now secures your profit without further negotiation risk."
