Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's a great deal at $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, your minimum acceptable price is met. Offering it to Bob at $100 maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

While Bob might reject this offer, there's no incentive for you to go lower. You're already securing the best possible outcome."
