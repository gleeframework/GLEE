"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 was a bit high for you, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we settle on $825,000? I think it's a fair price that balances both our interests.",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $785,000? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",785000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, this is a really nice product and I want to make a deal.  However,  $785,000 is really pushing my limit.  I could go up to $770,000, but that's my absolute best.",770000.0,Bob,6,,
