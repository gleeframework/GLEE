"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110. I think this is a fair price considering the product's features and my budget constraints.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your counteroffer. While I would like to accommodate your needs, I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. Therefore, I am unable to accept $110. I propose a counteroffer of $130. This price reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to ensure its profitability. I hope this meets your expectations.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I hope this is something we can work with.",125.0,Bob,4,
