"Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a unique product I think you'll find valuable.  I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1,100,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its potential, but I'm open to discussing further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly less than I can accept. This product has a lot of untapped potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I'm still interested, $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is my final offer.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
