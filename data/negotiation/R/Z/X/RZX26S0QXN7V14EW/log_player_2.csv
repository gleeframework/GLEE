"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $12,000 is still higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000). 
* There is potential to negotiate a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he should start by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. 
*  $10,500 is a substantial drop from $12,000, while still being a reasonable offer, considering the product is worth $10,000 to Alice.
*  This counteroffer gives Alice room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to potentially get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is slightly higher than her previous offer, but still more expensive than what Bob is willing to pay. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since Alice is willing to negotiate, as evidenced by her counteroffer. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer gives Bob a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,500 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. 
* Offering $11,000 is a compromise, showing that Bob is serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal. 
* This counteroffer is closer to Alice's offer, potentially leading to a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offers have been consistently higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  She's showing a willingness to negotiate, but her counteroffers are getting closer to her initial offer, suggesting there's not much room for a further discount.
* At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation is high. Alice might keep raising the price, pushing the deal further away from Bob's desired price. 
* Buying from John for $15,000 ensures Bob gets the product within his budget while avoiding the potential for a much higher price from Alice."
