Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get at least this much from Bob, and I'm hoping to secure an even better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,500 is below my minimum price, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get more, $10,000 is my minimum and it saves me the hassle of further negotiation. It's a good outcome, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
