"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business and I'm confident you'll see significant returns on investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your maximum budget, you can get a better deal. John is offering the product for $1,200,000, but there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with John's offer if necessary."
