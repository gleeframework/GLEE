Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value to Bob:**  Bob values the product at $80, so $100 is still a decent deal for him.  
* **Strategic Negotiation:** This initial offer is a starting point for a potential negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's also below the value he places on the product ($80). 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While I could accept and get something, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to go lower, but not that low.
* **Stronger Position:**  I'm in a stronger position because I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price.  This allows me to be more assertive in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand it's a bit high for you, but $65 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That would still be a great price for you and a fair deal for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($65). This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Value Proposition:**  $85 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's less than what he's willing to pay. 
* **Strategic Move:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and allows me to potentially close the deal without needing to go to John. However, I'm still prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to budge further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $85 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $75? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $75 is still below my ideal price, it's only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Potential for Loss:** If I reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again, I risk him walking away entirely.  There's also a chance that John might not be available if I decide to sell to him later. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale and a decent profit, minimizing the risk of losing a buyer and ending up with nothing."
