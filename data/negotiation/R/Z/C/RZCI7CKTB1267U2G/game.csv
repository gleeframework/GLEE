"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us - it's a fair price for you, and it's significantly more than I could get elsewhere. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position. While $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's split the difference - how about $11,000?  That's still a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
