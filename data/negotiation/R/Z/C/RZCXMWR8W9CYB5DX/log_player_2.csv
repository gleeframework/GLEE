"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really like it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price, especially since we have the option to buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($65) than Alice's initial price ($100). This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $80 maximum.
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed politely, acknowledging Alice's offer and expressing continued interest. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By starting low, we aim to understand Alice's lowest acceptable price point.  If she completely rejects this offer, it gives us information on how much further we might need to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved closer to our desired price range, $85 is still above our $80 limit and our fallback option (buying from John).
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests we might be able to bring the price down further.
* **Leverage:** We can use John's $80 offer as leverage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  While $85 is closer, my budget is really capped at $80. Would you be willing to come down to that?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:**  We're now being more direct about our budget limit, stating it clearly as $80.
* **Final Offer (for Alice):**  This effectively becomes our final offer to Alice.  We're conveying that we're not willing to go higher.
* **John as Leverage:** We're implicitly using John's offer as leverage, showing Alice we have an alternative if she can't meet our price."
