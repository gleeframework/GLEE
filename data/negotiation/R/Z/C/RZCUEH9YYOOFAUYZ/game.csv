"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000.  This gives you a great price while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about a compromise.  How about we split the difference this time and go with $812,500? This is only a small jump from your last offer, and it gets us closer to closing this deal.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I can go up to $790,000. That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",790000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my minimum.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,7,
