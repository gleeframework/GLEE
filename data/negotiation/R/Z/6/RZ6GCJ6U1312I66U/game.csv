"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still significantly above my budget.  To make this work, I'd need to come in at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and leaves room for us to both walk away satisfied.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can meet in the middle from here.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
