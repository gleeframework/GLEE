"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is far too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is way above his budget. It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still significantly above my budget.  To make this work, I'd need to come in at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and leaves room for us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still above Bob's budget.  It's important to remember that Bob can buy the product from John for $800,000 at any time.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is not budging much.  While her offer has come down, it's still significantly higher than Bob's target.  At this point, Bob is better off taking the guaranteed price from John at $800,000. The risk of continuing with Alice is that she may not drop her price further, leaving Bob with no deal."
