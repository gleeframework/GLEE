# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $950,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects a fair price given my needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
