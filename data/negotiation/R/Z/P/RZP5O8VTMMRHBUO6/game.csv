"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $11,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer would be more reflective of that.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,875? That's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value.",9875.0,Bob,4,
