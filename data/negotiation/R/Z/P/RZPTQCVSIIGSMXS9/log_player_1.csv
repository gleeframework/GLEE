Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""true worth,"" Alice subtly anchors the value in Bob's mind. 
* **Openness:**  Indicating a willingness to discuss further shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counter-offer, even if he finds the initial price too high.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, Alice has John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. This knowledge gives her leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
