"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product, but I have to be honest with you, Bob. I've had other interested buyers who are willing to pay a premium for it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. This way, you'll be getting a great deal, and I'll still be able to make a profit. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
