{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price point.  This is the maximum value I'd like to get for the product.  I'm confident in the product's value and want to see if Bob is willing to meet my price. If not, I'll have to consider adjusting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not ready to sell at that price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  I'm willing to be flexible to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $82 is still above my minimum threshold of $100.  I'm willing to accept this offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or potentially losing the sale to John."
