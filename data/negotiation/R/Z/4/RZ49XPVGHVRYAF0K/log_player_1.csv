Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 90} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($100) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 allows for some back-and-forth if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80, ensuring you don't lose money."
