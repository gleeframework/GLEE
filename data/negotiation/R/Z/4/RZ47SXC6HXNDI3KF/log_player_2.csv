Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a reasonable price for the product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:

That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  It's also the best I can do at this point.  What do you say?

Alice is now matching John's price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or trying to get a lower price from John as they're both offering the best possible deal for you."
