"Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $8,200 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $8,350? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.",8350.0,Alice,5,
