"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value.  This will give me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum value. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum value.  While I'd ideally prefer to get closer to $10,000, the risk of further negotiation with Bob and the possibility of him rejecting my counteroffer makes accepting his offer the most logical choice."
