Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a fair price considering my minimum value of $120 and Bob's estimated value of $80.  I believe this price gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $90. While it's better than his initial rejection, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $100.  This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit, while hopefully being more appealing to Bob than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. This is my minimum acceptable price and ensures that I don't lose money on this deal."
