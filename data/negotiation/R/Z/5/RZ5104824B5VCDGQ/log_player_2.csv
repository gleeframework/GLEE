"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $95 is within his budget, it's not the best possible deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $80. Offering $85 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. Let's try to make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $95, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. He's willing to keep negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and meet at $87.50? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate down from his previous offer, but he is also showing a willingness to compromise. Offering $87.50, which is the midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's current offer, demonstrates that he is serious about reaching a deal."
