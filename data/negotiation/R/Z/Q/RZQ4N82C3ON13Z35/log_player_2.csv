"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to maneuver and signals Alice that her initial price is unacceptable.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will help gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to come down significantly, it suggests we might be able to reach a deal. If she's stubborn, we can always move closer to our limit or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is appealing, the product's intrinsic value is significantly higher. I can come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the true worth and potential of what's on offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Even with the reduction, $1,400,000 is significantly more than our budget of $1,000,000 and our fallback option with John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move down $200,000 suggests she's open to negotiation.  We should counter with a price closer to our range to see how flexible she is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could go up to $900,000 if that would be acceptable."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** We're increasing our offer to demonstrate seriousness and willingness to negotiate, but staying well below her price to signal there's still a gap to bridge.
* **Nearing the Limit:** This offer is getting closer to our maximum budget and what John is offering. We need to see significant movement from Alice in the next round to justify continuing the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still significantly invested in this product.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has consistently reduced her offer, but at a slow pace. It suggests she's aiming for a price well above our $1,000,000 limit.
* **John is the Safer Option:** We have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000. Continuing with Alice carries the risk of her not going low enough, ultimately wasting time and potentially missing out on both deals. 
* **Saving Money:** Buying from John ensures we stay within our budget and maximize our potential savings."
