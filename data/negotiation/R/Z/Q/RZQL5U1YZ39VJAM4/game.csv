"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's still a fair price for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $120 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $90? That would be a great price for me.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is closer to your offer.  This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to John for $150.",100.0,Alice,5,
