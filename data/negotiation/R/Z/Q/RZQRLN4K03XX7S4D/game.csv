"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I think the product is great, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest!  I can come down a bit to $95.  That's still a fair price for this great product.  What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
