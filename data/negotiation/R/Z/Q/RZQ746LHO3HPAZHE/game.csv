"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a good price for you, considering the value of this product. Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay closer to my target value. Let's get this deal done!",9250.0,Alice,5,
