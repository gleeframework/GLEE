"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a good price for you, considering the value of this product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the budget. I can do $8,750, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than my minimum goal. I'm willing to risk a couple more rounds of negotiation. There's a chance Bob might be willing to budge a bit more, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly below what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay closer to my target value. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I can do $8,900, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We are in round 6, and while Bob has gotten closer to my desired price, we're still a considerable distance away. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of continuing the negotiation and not reaching a favorable price becomes too high. It's more advantageous for me to sell to John for $10,000 and ensure I reach my minimum desired profit."
