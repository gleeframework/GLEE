Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,075,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,087,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.  Let's finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,087,500 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially raising the price again is high.  Accepting this offer is the most prudent decision."
