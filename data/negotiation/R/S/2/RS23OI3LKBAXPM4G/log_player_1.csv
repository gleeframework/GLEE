Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you and this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so aiming high initially allows for maximizing potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum gives room for potential negotiation if he tries to haggle.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, having a backup buyer (John) at $8,000 ensures Alice doesn't lose out completely."
