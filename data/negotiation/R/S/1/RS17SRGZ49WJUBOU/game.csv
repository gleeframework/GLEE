"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,500 is a bit too high for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,250. This is a compromise that I think is fair, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",9250.0,Alice,3,
