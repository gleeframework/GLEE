Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,500 is a bit too high for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
