# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum price. Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $7500 is a bit lower than my ideal price, I'm willing to compromise. How about $8500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to recover most of my costs and giving you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
