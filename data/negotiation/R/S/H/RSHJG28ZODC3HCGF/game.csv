"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $7500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $7500 is a bit lower than my ideal price, I'm willing to compromise. How about $8500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to recover most of my costs and giving you a good deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - $8250.  This would be a fair compromise, and allow us both to reach an agreement.",8250.0,Bob,4,
