"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

You should reject Alice's offer. You're looking to save as much as possible, and $14,000 is still above your maximum price point. By rejecting, you can counteroffer and try to get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

You should buy the product from John.  Even with Alice's latest offer of $13,500, you are still exceeding your budget.  You're better off going with John's offer, which is within your budget and provides the best value for you."
