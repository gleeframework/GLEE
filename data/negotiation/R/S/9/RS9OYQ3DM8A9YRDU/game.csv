,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. $100 is closer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $105? I think that's a fair compromise.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. Would you consider $100 for the product? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to go a bit lower than that, so how about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,6,
