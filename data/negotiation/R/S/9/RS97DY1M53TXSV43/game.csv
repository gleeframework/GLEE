"Alice, your offer is way too high for me. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm only willing to pay $800000 for this product. This is my final offer, and I'm happy to walk away if it's not acceptable.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you be willing to consider $1400000 for the product?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm sticking to my original offer of $800000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move on to other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
