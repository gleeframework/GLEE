Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will be telling.  If he accepts, great! If he counters, it shows he's serious and willing to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
