,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I can go up to $120, but I really think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $160? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",160.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're getting close to your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $155? It's a small increase from your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",155.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really trying to find a compromise, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I can go up to $145, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",145.0,Bob,8,
