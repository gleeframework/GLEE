Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $19,000, which reflects its true value and potential."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you start by aiming higher with Bob.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering it at $19,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, potentially justifying the higher price in his mind.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or very price-sensitive, you might want to start slightly lower (but still above $15,000).
* **Urgency:**  If you need to sell quickly, a lower initial offer might be more appealing to Bob."
