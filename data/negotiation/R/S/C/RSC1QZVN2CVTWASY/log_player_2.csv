"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth $80 to Bob, he can afford to reject Alice's initial offer and attempt to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as low as possible.  A counteroffer of $55 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $65, and still leaves room for negotiation.  This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate and his belief that the product's value is lower than Alice's asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $60 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already shown his willingness to bargain and knows the product's value to him. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 58}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting the best price possible.  He's increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal.  The counteroffer of $58 is a reasonable compromise and might convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $62. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $62
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $62 is getting closer to Bob's desired price range, and there's only a limited number of rounds left. While Bob could keep negotiating, the risk of Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further or the time running out is high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price within the time limit."
