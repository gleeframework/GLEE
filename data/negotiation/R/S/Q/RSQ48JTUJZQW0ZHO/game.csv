"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $13,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $11,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both benefit from a deal at that point.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be firmer on the price.  $11,000 is too low for me.  My final offer is $11,800. If you're serious about the deal, this is a very reasonable compromise.",11800.0,Alice,5,
