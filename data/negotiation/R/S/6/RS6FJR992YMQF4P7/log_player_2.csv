You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can definitely do better than $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. I'm aiming to save as much as possible, but I'm also keeping in mind that I have a fallback option with John for $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still trying to negotiate a lower price. While $110 is closer to my ideal range, I think I can still get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to try a middle ground offer.  $105 is closer to Alice's last offer, but I'm still hoping to save a few dollars.  We're getting close to my limit though, so I'll need to be careful."
