"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to match this price again. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1300000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1500000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
