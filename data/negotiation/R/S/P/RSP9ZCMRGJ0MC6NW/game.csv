"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I can meet you halfway at $10,500. Would you be interested in that price?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite comfortable with $9,500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're close but struggling to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $10,000. That's a strong offer and reflects my serious interest in the product.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",11500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this negotiation is dragging on. I'm willing to make one final offer of $10,250. If you don't accept, I'll have to buy from John.",10250.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to give in at $10,250. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the lowest price I can accept. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider selling to John.",12000.0,Alice,9,
