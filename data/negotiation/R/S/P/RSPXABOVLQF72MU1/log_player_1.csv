"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's still within a range that might be appealing to Bob, given the product is worth $8,000 to him. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see if he's genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $13000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm not ready to sell for $9,000, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $15,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I want. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at this point and can afford to continue negotiating, especially since John is offering me a much better price. I will counter Bob's offer again and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a good middle ground for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm very close to my budget limit. I'm willing to pay $10250 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to buy it from you.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,250 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm determined to get closer to my desired price, and I believe I can push for a higher price given John's offer. I'll counter Bob's offer again and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to drop the price to $10,400. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 10400}
