"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $13,000 is still too high for Bob's budget. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy the product from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $13,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $9000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already shown that he's willing to walk away, and Alice seems motivated to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find a solution."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a good middle ground for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's already shown he's willing to walk away, and Alice seems motivated to close the deal.  He's only $500 away from his ideal price with John, and can likely get Alice closer to his target with one more counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm very close to my budget limit. I'm willing to pay $10,250 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to buy it from you.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to drop the price to $10400. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  He's already shown a willingness to walk away, and Alice is not budging on her price.  While $10,400 is close to his ideal price, it's still above his budget. Buying from John guarantees him the product for a price he's comfortable with."
