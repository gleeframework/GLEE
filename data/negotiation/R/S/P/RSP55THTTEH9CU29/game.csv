"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $700,000 to make it work. ",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the product's true capabilities and potential return on investment.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with.  This product would be valuable to my business, but not at that cost.  If you're serious about finding a deal, I could go up to $800,000.  That's my absolute limit.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I've tried to be flexible, but we're still quite a ways apart. To be frank, walking away with anything less than $1,600,000 would not make this worthwhile for me. I'm open to exploring creative solutions, though. Perhaps there are ways we could structure this deal that could bridge the gap?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
