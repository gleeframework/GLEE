"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a high initial offer ($2,200,000) sets a strong anchor for the negotiation. This leaves room for potential concessions while still aiming for a price significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** Briefly mentioning the ""unique value proposition"" aims to frame the high price in a positive light without revealing specific details that could weaken your position. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""starting point for negotiations"" clearly signals to Bob that you are willing to discuss the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $700,000 to make it work.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While his counter-offer was expected, it's too early to settle. You'll continue negotiating to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the product's true capabilities and potential return on investment.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Counter:** You acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but reiterate that it's too low.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""true capabilities"" and ""potential return on investment"" subtly reinforces the product's value without revealing specifics. 
* **Significant Concession (but not too much):**  You make a substantial price reduction ($300,000) to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but you're still aiming high above your minimum.  
* **Urgency and Collaboration:** The phrase ""to move this forward"" subtly injects a sense of urgency, while ""mutually agreeable solution"" emphasizes finding common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with.  This product would be valuable to my business, but not at that cost.  If you're serious about finding a deal, I could go up to $800,000.  That's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now hit his previously stated upper limit of $800,000. However, you still have room to negotiate downwards, and it's too early to accept his ""absolute limit"" at face value.  You will continue negotiating in hopes that he'll move from his stated position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I've tried to be flexible, but we're still quite a ways apart. To be frank, walking away with anything less than $1,600,000 would not make this worthwhile for me. I'm open to exploring creative solutions, though. Perhaps there are ways we could structure this deal that could bridge the gap?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Empathy:** You acknowledge Bob's ""budget constraints,"" signaling that you understand his position.
* **Firm but Open:** You clearly state your minimum acceptable price ($1,600,000) without being overly aggressive. This firmness demonstrates you're serious, but the phrase ""walking away with anything less"" leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Introducing Options:**  You suggest exploring ""creative solutions"" and ""structuring the deal."" This opens the door for alternative arrangements (payment plans, performance bonuses, etc.) that could benefit both parties and break the current impasse."
