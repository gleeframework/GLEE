Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're starting above your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's not too high:** You want to entice Bob but avoid scaring him off immediately.
* **It includes a friendly message:** A friendly message can help establish rapport and encourage Bob to engage.

Remember, this is just the first offer. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and your assessment of his interest!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still below my desired selling point. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? I'm confident you'll still get great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  Offering $135 is a compromise, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:** Emphasizing ""great value"" reinforces the product's worth and encourages acceptance.
* **Maintaining a higher price:** This offer is still closer to my initial desired price, while acknowledging Bob's bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is still a bit below my desired price point, it's getting closer to what I'm willing to accept.  Further negotiation might drag on, and I'm not confident of getting much higher.  Selling to Bob at $125 is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing him entirely by rejecting his offer."
