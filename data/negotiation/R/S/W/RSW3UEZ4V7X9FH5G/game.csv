"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $900,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. How about we try $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be frank, $900,000 is the highest I can go. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is your maximum offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about we try $912,500?",912500.0,Alice,7,
