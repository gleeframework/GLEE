"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1050000 for this product.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that amount.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1150000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $1050000. How about we split the difference and agree on $1100000? ",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $1080000, which is a $20000 discount from my previous offer. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
