"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a great deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above your target. How about we try $825,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible.",825000.0,Bob,4,
