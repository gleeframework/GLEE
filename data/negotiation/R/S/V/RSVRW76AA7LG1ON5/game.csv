"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,150,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I've placed on this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
