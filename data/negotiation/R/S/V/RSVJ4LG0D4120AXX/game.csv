"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a fair price for a great product, and I think you'll be happy with the compromise.",115.0,Alice,5,
