"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  $900,000 is still too high for Bob, given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to him.  There's room to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm now offering the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, it's still too high. There's still room to negotiate further and potentially reach a price closer to $1,000,000, which would be a better deal for him."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $987,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll only go down to $990,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He has negotiated the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer, and it's now just slightly above the midpoint between their values.  Further negotiation may be possible, but the risk of Alice walking away and forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price is too high.  Accepting the offer at $990,000 is the best option for Bob."
