"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation but also demonstrates that you are serious about getting a good price.  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he may be willing to pay a bit more than your asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I still want to get a price closer to my initial asking price.  $1,125,000 is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,080,000 is a decent price, it's still below what I feel the product is worth.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on this one.  $1,100,000 is a reasonable offer, and I think it's likely he'll accept.  If not, I'm getting closer to my minimum price, and I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I still believe there's potential to reach an agreement with Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1080000} 
```

I'm going to make a final compromise.  $1,080,000 is my absolute bottom line. I'm confident Bob will accept this offer, as he has shown a willingness to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll sell the product to John, as the risk of further negotiation is not worth losing more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price, and I have only two rounds left.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  I'll sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I secure at least my minimum price."
