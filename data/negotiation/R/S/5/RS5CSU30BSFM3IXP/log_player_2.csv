"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since he can buy the product from John for $100, Alice's offer of $140 is not a good deal.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to get the product for a lower price."
