"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you as well. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it would bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate and a guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000, so I can afford to hold out for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great value for you considering the product's worth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price of $1,000,000.  I have 6 more rounds to negotiate. I'll continue to counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  There's a good chance we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This product is truly worth that much to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable for your business.  Let's close this deal at this fair price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
