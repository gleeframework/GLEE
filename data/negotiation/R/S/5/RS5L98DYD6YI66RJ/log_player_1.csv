"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to gauge his interest.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation, hoping to land somewhere in between my minimum and his maximum.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to hopefully make Bob more receptive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **More negotiation is needed:** I believe I can still get closer to my target price through further negotiation.
* **Opportunity to counter:** Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (somewhat):**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial proposal.  This shows a willingness to negotiate but also maintains a firm stance on my value.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get from the product to justify the price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a phrase that emphasizes my openness to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,300,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time to push back:** I'm starting to run out of rounds, and I need to be more assertive in pushing for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Counteroffer needed:** Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer, hopefully closer to my minimum or to force Bob to make a more serious counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000.  This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it will generate significant value for you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our needs. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but flexible:** I'm dropping the price slightly, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility but also maintains my position.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product offers to him, hoping to increase his perceived value and make him more willing to pay more.
* **Collaborative approach:** I'm using language that suggests a desire to find a mutually beneficial solution, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Time pressure:**  I'm acknowledging the time pressure (only 5 rounds left) to subtly increase the urgency for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,250,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is running out:** We are now in round 6 with only 4 rounds left.  The risk of not getting a better offer is increasing.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation with Bob. 

It's better to take the sure thing with John than risk getting stuck with Bob's offer."
