"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very reasonable price. Let's start with $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, though. How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $92. Can you consider that?,92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $92 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $93? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",93.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still think we can find a better price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $91. Can you consider that?",91.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a little impatient.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more.  How about we settle on $92?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",92.0,Alice,7,
