"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It leaves very little room for negotiation given my $12,000 limit. It's worth seeing if I can get her price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,500) to gauge Alice's flexibility. This is closer to her perceived value ($8,000) while still leaving room for negotiation on my end. 
* **Expressing Interest:** I want to signal that I'm genuinely interested in the product to encourage Alice to work with me. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  By saying ""around $8,500,"" I'm giving myself some flexibility in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is meeting me in the middle, which is a good sign, but $9,750 is still a significant markup from her value. I'm aiming to get the price closer to $9,000, so I'll reject this offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice. I'm willing to move up a bit, but $9,750 is still a little high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm increasing my offer to $9,000 to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm sticking to a price point that's still advantageous for me.
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both parties, which could make Alice more receptive.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and respectful tone to keep the negotiation moving smoothly."
