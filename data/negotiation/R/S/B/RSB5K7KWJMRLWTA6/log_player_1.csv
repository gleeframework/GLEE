"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $11,000, which is still lower than the product's worth to Bob ($12,000) but gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Using a friendly and encouraging tone helps build rapport and increases the chance of a successful negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm subtly emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit he'll gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:**  While I need to be flexible, I can't accept $8,500 as it's below my minimum of $8,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's room to negotiate with Bob. I'm confident I can get a higher price with further rounds.
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:**  Although John offers $8,000, I have a chance to potentially earn more with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise & Middle Ground:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice. I'm willing to move up a bit, but $9,750 is still a little high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum of $8,000.  
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  While I could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk of losing Bob's interest entirely.  
* **Time Factor:**  It's important to remember that I have a limited number of rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit without risking further negotiations."
