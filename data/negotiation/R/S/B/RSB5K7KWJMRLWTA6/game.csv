"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price considering the value of the product.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice. I'm willing to move up a bit, but $9,750 is still a little high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",9000.0,Bob,4,
