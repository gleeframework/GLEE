Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is consistently unwilling to meet at a price point that is significantly beneficial for you.  While he is inching closer, the increments are small, and you risk getting locked into further lowball offers. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000 which is a safer and more profitable outcome at this point."
