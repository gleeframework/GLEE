"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I'm aiming for a fair deal. How about $1,250,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This would allow us both to achieve a fair deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
