"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation and shows Bob that I'm willing to work with him.  I believe this initial offer strikes a balance between being attractive to Bob while still leaving room for me to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I'm open to negotiation, $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe this counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal, but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Since we're already on round 4, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate with Bob might take us too close to my deadline of 10 rounds, potentially forcing me to sell to John for $1,200,000.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale, albeit for a lower price than I'd like, but it also protects me from potentially having to sell to John."
