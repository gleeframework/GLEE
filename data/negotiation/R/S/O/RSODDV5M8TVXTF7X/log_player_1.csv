Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $16,000 is still a bit steep for my budget though.  Could you possibly do $14,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering the value.
