"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't go that low.  How about we settle at $16,000?  This feels like a fair compromise to me.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $16,000 is still a bit steep for my budget though.  Could you possibly do $14,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering the value.",14000.0,Bob,6,
