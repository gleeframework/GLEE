"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $18000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your interest in the product, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm afraid $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $16000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $14000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $14000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $15500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I think $14000 is a fair offer. I'm willing to go up to $15000, but I don't think I can go any higher. Can you consider that?",15000.0,Bob,6,
