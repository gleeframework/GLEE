"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it useful. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  However, $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefit to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $115 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $105. Can you consider this revised offer?,105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $105.  I'm willing to offer a final concession and bring the price down to $110. This is my best offer. If you're serious about purchasing the product, let's close the deal now.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",90.0,Bob,6,
