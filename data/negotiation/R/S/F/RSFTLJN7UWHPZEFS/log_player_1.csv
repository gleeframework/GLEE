"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price that's below my minimum but still leaves some room for negotiation. This should pique Bob's interest and encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  However, $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefit to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $115 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $105. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further.  I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $105.  I'm willing to offer a final concession and bring the price down to $110. This is my best offer. If you're serious about purchasing the product, let's close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $90 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150.  While I would have preferred to get a better price from Bob, it's better to secure a guaranteed profit than to risk losing out completely."
