Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below the product's value to Bob ($15,000), making it more likely he'll accept.
* **It's a strong opening:**  By starting high, you establish a strong initial position and give yourself more room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly below what you want. You have two better options:

* **Reject and counteroffer:** By rejecting, you can counteroffer with a price closer to your desired $14,000.  This keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a higher final price. 
* **Sell to John:** This guarantees a sale at your minimum acceptable price.  However, you'd be leaving potential profit on the table if you think you can get more from Bob.

Since your goal is to maximize profit, **rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering is the best strategy at this point.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both a fair price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a middle ground between your previous $14,000 offer and Bob's $11,500 offer.
* **Reasonable price:** $13,000 is still above your minimum and within the range of what Bob is willing to pay.
* **Positive message:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer and shows your willingness to compromise, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting your minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 meets your minimum acceptable price.
* **No further negotiation:** There's no guarantee you can get a higher price from Bob.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether.
* **John's offer:** While John is also offering $12,000, there's no advantage to switching buyers at this point.

Therefore, **accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy** as it secures a sale at your minimum acceptable price and minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely."
