I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $12,000, so I'm not risking a loss.  However, by offering a higher price, I'm giving Bob an incentive to accept, potentially earning me more."
