"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,300,000, which reflects its market value and the potential benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. While I appreciate your offer, $1,150,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000, recognizing the potential benefit to you. This price still reflects the product's intrinsic value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,250,000. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
