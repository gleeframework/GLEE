"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work out a better deal. How about $95 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $105? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
I'm offering $105, which is still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I understand your position. Let's try $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price. I can either accept his offer now or risk further negotiation that might not lead to a higher price and could potentially result in me having to sell to John for the same price."
