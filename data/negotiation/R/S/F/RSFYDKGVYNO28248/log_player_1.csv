Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $900,000 is higher than Bob's $800,000 valuation, giving him a good reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed, while still earning significantly more than your minimum of $1,000,000. 

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, you encourage him to negotiate, potentially leading to a higher price than if you started with your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Is there any flexibility in your pricing? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far below my minimum of $1,000,000. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiations and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a valuable product while I still make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $825,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in moving forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I initially aimed for a higher price, Bob's counteroffer of $825,000 is getting close to my minimum. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer, and I don't want to risk selling to John for $1,000,000. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit, although it's not my ideal outcome. It's a good compromise considering the circumstances."
