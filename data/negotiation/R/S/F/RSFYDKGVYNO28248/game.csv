"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Is there any flexibility in your pricing?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a valuable product while I still make a decent profit.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $825,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in moving forward with the purchase.",825000.0,Bob,4,
