"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $1500000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm very interested, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to work within them. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000 for the product. This is a significant discount from our initial asking price, but I believe it reflects the value you place on the product while staying within your budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable, and we can move forward with the transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800000. It's my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we've discussed. I hope we can reach a deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your budget constraints. In order to reach an agreement, I am prepared to lower the price to $950000 for the product.

I believe this offer strikes a balance between our interests and represents a fair compromise. Please let me know if this revised proposal works for you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
