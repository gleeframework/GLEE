"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $18000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $15000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $12000. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
