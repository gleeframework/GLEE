Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Minimum:** I value the product at $15,000, so I won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so I want to offer him a price that is attractive but still profitable for me.
* **John's Value:** I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000. This gives me a safety net.

By offering $14,000, I am:

* **Maximizing my potential profit:**  If Bob accepts, I make a profit of $2,000.
* **Minimizing my risk:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $15,000, guaranteeing a profit. 

This strategy balances the potential for a higher profit with the certainty of a sale."
