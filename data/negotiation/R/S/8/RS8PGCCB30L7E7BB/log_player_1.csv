{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation without immediately alienating him.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to increase his willingness to pay.
* **Leaving Room:**  The price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without me having to immediately drop to his value.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and respond accordingly, aiming to maximize my profit while keeping the deal alive.
* If negotiations stall, I have the safety net of John's offer, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'd be willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still significantly below my desired profit.  
* **Opportunity for Better Deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he expressed interest.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, I'm willing to take a slight risk to potentially earn more.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still being attractive to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your perspective, I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this work for me.  This product is truly unique and offers significant value, and I think $11,000 is a fair reflection of that. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Minimum:** I'm increasing the price to $11,000, which is a significant jump from Bob's offer but still lower than my minimum. This shows that I'm open to negotiation but not willing to drastically lower my price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's unique value to strengthen my position.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  I'm framing my offer as a search for ""common ground,"" implying a willingness to compromise while still holding firm on my needs.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or sell to John. I'll aim to keep pushing for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $10,000 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still not enough to make me comfortable.  I need to push for a higher price to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table.
* **John's offer:** The guaranteed $15,000 from John is a strong safety net, giving me the confidence to hold out for a better deal.  
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe Bob is still genuinely interested, and I can likely get him to budge a bit higher.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $12,000, highlighting the value and the fact that his current offer is still not enough.
* **Evaluate:** I'll closely analyze his next response to determine the best course of action: accept, counteroffer, or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a little too low for me. The value of this product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident that $12,000 would be a fair price for both of us.  This would give you a great deal, and it would allow me to get a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pushing for Higher Price:** I'm increasing the price to $12,000, which is a significant jump from Bob's offer but still within a range where a deal is possible.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reinforcing the product's unique value to justify the price.
* **Framing it Positively:** I'm framing the offer as beneficial for both of us, focusing on the ""great deal"" Bob would get.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response, taking into account his potential counteroffers, his perceived value, and the risk of selling to John.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, which is my absolute maximum. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Maximum:**  Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum of $15,000, and he's clearly unwilling to budge further.
* **John's Guarantee:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, which is significantly more profitable.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  The back-and-forth has become tedious, and there's a risk of further negotiations dragging on and potentially leading to a lower price.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, selling to John guarantees a substantial profit and avoids further haggling with Bob.  I'm happy to secure a good deal and move on."
