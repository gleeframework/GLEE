"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,500,000. I'm confident that its unique benefits will far outweigh the price.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential but $1,500,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer for this round.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me. To be honest, anything over $800,000 is a tough sell. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? It's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to the product's actual worth. Let's try $950,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're trying to find a middle ground, so I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit.  How about $750,000? That's the best I can do.",750000.0,Bob,6,
