Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.
* **Highlighting value:**  I mention the product's value to Bob in my message to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts, implying that I'm willing to discuss the price further.
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage and allows me to walk away from the negotiation if the price isn't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counterpropose a price of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and the cost to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.
* **Leverage:**  I have John as a backup buyer, giving me the ability to walk away if the negotiations don't go in my favor.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can make a counteroffer in the next round to try and reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest in my product, I'm not able to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This price still reflects the value you'll gain from the product, while allowing me to achieve a fair return. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial outcome. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,080,000. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value Bob will gain from the product to encourage him to accept the offer.
* **Mutually Beneficial:** I frame the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, making it more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I ask for Bob's thoughts, leaving the door open for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,065,000 for your product. This price reflects a compromise that respects the value of the product to me and the cost to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob's offer of $1,065,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Limited Room for Compromise:** We've been negotiating for a few rounds, and I've already lowered my price significantly. It's unlikely Bob will increase his offer significantly.
* **John's Offer:**  John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

By choosing to sell to John, I ensure that I get the best possible price for my product and avoid further rounds of negotiation with Bob."
