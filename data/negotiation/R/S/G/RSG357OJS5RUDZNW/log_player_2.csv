"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating. You have a significant buffer between your maximum price ($15,000) and Alice's offer ($12,000), making it worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great! However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good price, you still have room to negotiate further. It's worth trying to push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John.  You have several rounds left, so there's time to explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is a good compromise. While you could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and possibly raising her price again is present.  You've already saved $3,750 compared to John's price, and further negotiation might not yield a significant enough improvement to justify the risk."
