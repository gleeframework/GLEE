"Alice, your product looks great! However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
