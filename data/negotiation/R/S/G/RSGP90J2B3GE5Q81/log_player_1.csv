"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position that allows for negotiation while ensuring I get a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm confident that even if Bob rejects, I can work with him to reach a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds. If he's not willing to negotiate, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a decent price, I'm confident I can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit higher.  I'm still early in the negotiation, and I have 8 more rounds to reach a deal.  I'll counteroffer and aim for a price closer to my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer at $950,000. This is a reasonable compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to show Bob I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm also willing to be flexible.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm still confident I can get a price that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're getting closer to a deal, and $920,000 is a good price that's within my acceptable range. While I could try to squeeze out a little more, it's important to weigh the potential gain against the risk of losing the deal altogether. With 6 rounds remaining, I'd rather secure a good deal than risk losing a potential buyer."
