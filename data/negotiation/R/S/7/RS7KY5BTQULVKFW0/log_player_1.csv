Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is still too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to what I want, I'm still not comfortable settling for that price. I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still not quite there for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,275,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but no higher. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is too low for me.  While I have a couple more rounds, the risk of not getting a better offer is too high.  Selling to John guarantees me a $1,000,000 profit, which is a good outcome."
