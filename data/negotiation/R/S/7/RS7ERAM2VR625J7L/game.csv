"I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't go that low. How about we split the difference at $950,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $935,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. What do you say?",935000.0,Alice,5,
