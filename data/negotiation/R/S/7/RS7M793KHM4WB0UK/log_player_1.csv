"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my value.  Since Bob values the product at $800,000, I'm hoping he sees potential for a profitable deal even at this price.  We'll see if he bites or if we need to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a more agreeable price.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on my bottom line. Hopefully, this will be a sweet spot for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my value, I'm still not quite satisfied. I'd prefer to try and push for my target price of $1,000,000. Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm splitting the difference and offering $950,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about closing the deal and willing to meet him halfway. It's a good compromise that still gives me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum value and a good deal considering how much I've already lowered my price. I don't want to risk pushing him away further and losing the deal entirely, especially with only four rounds left."
