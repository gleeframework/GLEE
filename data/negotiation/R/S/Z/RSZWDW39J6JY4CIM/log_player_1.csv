{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident I can get at least $11,000 from Bob, since the product is worth $12,000 to him. 

I'll be ready to counter any offers Bob makes, but I also have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay $10,000. This gives me the flexibility to walk away if negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If not, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low. It's not even close to what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to be closer to $11,000. How about we split the difference at $10,250? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. It also positions me to get a better price than John's offer, ensuring I maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too far away from my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is equal to John's offer.  Since I'm confident I can't get a better price from Bob, I'll accept his offer to avoid any further negotiation and secure the sale."
