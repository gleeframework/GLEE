"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, given your interest. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $10,500?  This is my final offer. ",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,500 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,750.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10750.0,Alice,5,
