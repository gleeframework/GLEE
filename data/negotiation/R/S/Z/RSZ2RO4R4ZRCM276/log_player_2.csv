"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000, and Alice is asking for $12,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so it's worth trying to get a better price.

**Next Step:** You will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your range:**  You're offering $10,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within your budget.
* **Reasonable opening counteroffer:** This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying but are also trying to negotiate a favorable price. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  You still have 9 rounds left to further bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, given your interest. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your preferred price point.
* **You have room to negotiate further.** You have 8 rounds left, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Goal is to save as much as possible.**  Continuing to bargain could get you a lower price.

**Next Step:** You will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $10,500?  This is my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:** This offer splits the difference between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer, demonstrating your willingness to meet halfway.
* **Signaling your finality:** Stating that this is your ""final offer"" adds pressure to Alice and may encourage her to accept.
* **Room for negotiation, but not much:** You have 7 rounds left, but you're pushing toward a deal.

**Next Step:**  Let's see what Alice does with your counteroffer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,500 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,750.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your preferred price:**  $10,750 is only $250 more than your last counteroffer.
* **Alice is signaling finality:** She states this is her ""final offer,"" suggesting further negotiation might not be fruitful.
* **Time is a factor:** You have 5 rounds left, and the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice increases with each passing round.  
* **Buying from John is a worse outcome:**  If you reject Alice's offer and fail to reach a deal, you'll have to buy from John at $15,000, costing you significantly more.

**While you could try to counteroffer once more, the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential benefit of getting an even lower price from Alice.  It's better to accept the deal and secure the product within your budget.**"
