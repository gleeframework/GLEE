Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is something, it's significantly below what I need to make. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. Would you consider $875,000? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $875,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $912,500?  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 912500}
