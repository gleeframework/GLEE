"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $950,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. Would you consider $875,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $875,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $912,500?  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",912500.0,Alice,5,
