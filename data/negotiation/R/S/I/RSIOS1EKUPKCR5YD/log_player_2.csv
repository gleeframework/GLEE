"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is a bit too close to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Alice a chance to counter if $100 is too low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $125?  That's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice came down to $125, which is close enough to my $120 limit. It's not worth risking the negotiation falling through and missing out on the product entirely."
