"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1200000 is simply too low for me to accept at this time. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I need to ensure I receive a fair price.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a significant concession, but I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we continue to negotiate.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1600000, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. Would you be willing to meet me at $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're eager to acquire this product, and I appreciate your continued interest. However, $1400000 still doesn't meet my minimum requirement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1550000, reflecting the value I see in this product and the potential it holds for you. Let's finalize this deal now.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
