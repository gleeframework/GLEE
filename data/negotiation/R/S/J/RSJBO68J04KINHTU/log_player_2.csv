Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a budget, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable accepting that price. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1000000. This is as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.
