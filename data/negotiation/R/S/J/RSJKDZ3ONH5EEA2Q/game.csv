"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $12,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  $12,000 is still a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? That would work much better for me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere.",11000.0,Alice,5,
