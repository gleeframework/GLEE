"That's a bit too high for me, Alice. How about $130? I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is tight.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise. How about $180? It's a fair price, considering the quality of the product and the value it will bring to you.",180.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $180 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $145. If you're serious about selling, let's make this deal.",145.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $170? It's a fair price that works for both of us.",170.0,Alice,5,
