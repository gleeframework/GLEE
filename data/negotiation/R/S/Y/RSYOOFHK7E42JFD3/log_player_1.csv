Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,100,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) to encourage a counter-offer.
    *  Lower than John's offer, providing Bob a seemingly good deal if he accepts outright.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  The message hints at other potential buyers, creating a sense of urgency and scarcity to encourage Bob to act quickly."
