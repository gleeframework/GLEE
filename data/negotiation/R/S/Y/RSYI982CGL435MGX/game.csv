"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $110 is a good offer, it's a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? That's still a great deal for you, and it works for me. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $115. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and pay $112.50. Can you consider my revised offer?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal.  However, $112.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $113.50, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",113.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $113.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and pay $113.00. Can you consider my revised offer?",113.0,Bob,6,
