"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $145. I believe this price reflects the value you would gain from it, while ensuring a fair return for us. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $145 is less than Alice's value of $150, it's still more than Bob's maximum of $120. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $145 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $130 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to counter with an offer of $135 for the product. This price still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being competitive in the market. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $135 is closer to his maximum of $120, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer again allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price, or if unsuccessful, still have the option to buy from John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $132 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 132}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering my previous offers, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to adjust my price to $133 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin, while being more competitive in the market. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $133
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily negotiating a lower price, but $133 is still above his maximum of $120.  He has already made several counteroffers, and it's possible Alice won't budge further.  To avoid potentially getting stuck at a higher price, Bob chooses to buy from John for $120, ensuring he gets the product at his desired price point."
