"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as you've already expressed interest in it at a lower price.  If you're interested, let's discuss the details. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value, you can get a better deal from John for $800,000. There's no point in spending more when you have a guaranteed lower price elsewhere."
