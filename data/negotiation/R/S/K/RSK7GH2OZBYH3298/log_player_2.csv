"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's something I'm personally valuing at no less than $10,000, and I know it would be worth that much to you as well. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up who's happy to pay my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
