Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $17,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount.  $14,500 is too low, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering both our perspectives. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $15,500 is slightly less than I was hoping for, it's still a good deal and above my minimum threshold. It's important to remember that the longer the negotiation drags on, the more risk there is of losing the sale entirely."
