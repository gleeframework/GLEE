"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $2,250,000 is not within my budget. I could consider something closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,800,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your initial offer.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,800,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high.  I could potentially go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you. You've stated $1,000,000 is your absolute maximum, and I respect that.  To be fair, I'm also working within certain constraints. I could make this work for $1,400,000.  This is a compromise, but I believe it represents a fair deal given the product's value.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
