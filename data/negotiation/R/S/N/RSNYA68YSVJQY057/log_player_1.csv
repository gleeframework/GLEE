Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $8,000, so we need to offer a price lower than his valuation but as close as possible to our minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John if Bob declines. This knowledge gives us leverage to aim for a higher price with Bob.

By offering the product at $12,000, we are maximizing our potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
