"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe this price reflects its worth and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  $2000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1600000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1900000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. However, $1900000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1700000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1800000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,5,
