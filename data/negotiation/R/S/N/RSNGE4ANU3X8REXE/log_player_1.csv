"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, but still keeping the price above my minimum.  I'm hoping he'll see the value of the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  He's only increased his offer by $200, which isn't a significant enough jump for me to accept. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $13,500.  This is a small increase from my last offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he's truly interested, he might be willing to close the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to sell for that amount. I believe there's room for further negotiation, so I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13300}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,300.  This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure as the rounds are dwindling. This is a calculated risk to see if Bob is willing to close the deal within the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  We're running out of time, and I'm not sure if I can get Bob to increase his offer any further.  While $10,000 is my absolute minimum, it's still a decent profit, and it's guaranteed. I'd rather have the certainty of a sale than risk another round of negotiation that might not be fruitful."
