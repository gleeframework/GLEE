Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $20,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $14,000. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $14000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17500.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground here! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for less. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
