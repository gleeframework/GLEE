"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit steep at $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your interest. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,600,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1,500,000. This is the highest I can go. Can you consider this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
