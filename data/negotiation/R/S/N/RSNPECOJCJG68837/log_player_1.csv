{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum desired price ($1,500,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and positive**, emphasizing the potential benefit for Bob. This sets a good tone for the negotiation. 

I'm willing to go lower than $1,200,000, but I want to see Bob's reaction first and gauge his willingness to negotiate.  If he rejects, I can make a counteroffer closer to his value ($800,000), but I'll aim to stay above my minimum price.  If negotiations stall, I have the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum desired price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further. I believe I can get a better price, especially since John is willing to pay significantly more.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between $900,000 and my minimum of $1,500,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer, but how about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This price would still give you a significant savings compared to my original offer, and it would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and makes it seem like a fair deal.
* **Highlighting the benefits:** I'm emphasizing the savings Bob would still get compared to my original offer, making the price more appealing.
* **Positive and polite tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging a continued discussion. 

This counteroffer aims to find a balance between securing a decent price and keeping the negotiation going.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to consider a lower counteroffer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and your new offer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not ready to settle. I'm confident that I can get a better deal, especially considering John is willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm not willing to give up $550,000 in potential profit just yet.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between $950,000 and my minimum of $1,500,000. I'll likely propose a price closer to $1,100,000 or $1,150,000, hoping to find a compromise that is closer to my desired price. If Bob continues to be unwilling to budge, I will have to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we settle on $1,100,000? This price is a good compromise, and it would still provide you with a substantial saving compared to my initial offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Savings:** I'm highlighting the compromise I'm making by coming down from my previous offer, and emphasizing the savings Bob would still enjoy.
* **Fairness and Solution:** I'm framing the offer as a fair solution that benefits both parties, making it seem like a win-win situation.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm ending the message with a question, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially reach an agreement.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to my desired price range while still appearing reasonable.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to seriously consider selling to John, as it may be difficult to secure a significantly higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is getting closer to my target. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $980,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I've already made several concessions, and it seems Bob isn't willing to budge significantly.  At this point, it's clear that reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob is unlikely. 

Given John's offer of $1,500,000, it's in my best interest to sell the product to him. This will ensure that I get the best possible price for the product and avoid further negotiation with Bob that may not be fruitful."
