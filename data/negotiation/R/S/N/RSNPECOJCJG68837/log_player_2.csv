Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.

This price would still give you a significant savings compared to my original offer, and it would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.
