"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks. 
* **Anchoring:**  This high initial offer sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even though it's unrealistic, it can influence his perception of what a fair price might be, making him more receptive to lower offers later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested, but only if we can get closer to a realistic price. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Space:**  While Bob's offer is low, his willingness to negotiate indicates a potential deal can be reached. There's room to work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. You don't need to accept a low offer out of desperation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $18,000 might have been on the high side, $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** Coming down from the initial high offer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:**  $14,000 is closer to your minimum price but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Justify the Price:**  By mentioning the product's value, you subtly reinforce that your price isn't arbitrary and encourage Bob to consider its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we try $10,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below your $12,000 minimum. Accepting would mean losing potential profit.
* **Approaching His Limit:** Bob's offer reaching his perceived value ($10,000) suggests he's getting closer to his maximum price. 
* **Leverage John:**  It's time to leverage your backup plan. By threatening to sell to John, you create a sense of urgency and might push Bob closer to your price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $10,000 is pushing the limits of what I can accept.  I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  To be fair to you, I'm willing to come down to $12,500, but this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality and Urgency:**  By stating this is your final offer and mentioning another buyer, you create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Slight Concession:**  Coming down slightly to $12,500 shows some flexibility while staying above your absolute minimum. 
* **Aiming for Profit:** This offer still allows you to make a profit while being closer to a price Bob might consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $11,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's final offer of $11,000 is still below your $12,000 minimum.
* **Unlikely to Budge:**  He's explicitly stated it's his absolute maximum, making further concessions from him improbable.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed $12,000.  It makes more sense to secure a sure profit than to risk continued negotiation for a marginally better outcome with Bob. 
 
At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob has a lower expected value than selling to John."
