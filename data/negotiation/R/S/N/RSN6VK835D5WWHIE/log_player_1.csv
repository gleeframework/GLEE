"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. I'm going to try and counteroffer him to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $140? That's still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $130? That's the lowest I can go, but I really want to make a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $150. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $130 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  That's a fair price, and I'm hoping you'll agree.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $125. If you can meet me at that price, I'll make the deal. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While I'd like to make a deal with Bob, it's clear that we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  John is offering me my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing a guaranteed sale by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
