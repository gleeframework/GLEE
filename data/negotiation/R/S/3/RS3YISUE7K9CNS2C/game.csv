"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I'm confident it will be valuable to you as well. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $12,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $12,750?  I think this is a good compromise for both of us.",12750.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be as flexible as possible here. While I value this product at $12,000, I'm willing to come down to $11,750. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement before we run out of time.",11750.0,Alice,5,
