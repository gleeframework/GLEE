Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $2000000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum spending limit. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
