"Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration of its value, we believe it is worth $2000000. We understand that the true value might be subjective, but based on our research and market analysis, this is a fair price. Let's discuss how we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $2000000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum spending limit. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
