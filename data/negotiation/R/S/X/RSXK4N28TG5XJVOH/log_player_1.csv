Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the product's value. How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $85 just isn't enough for me to move forward.  Let's split the difference - how about $90?  This way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $89 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $87. I really think that's the best I can do. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, the negotiation has stalled, and I don't want to risk getting stuck at a price lower than my minimum.  It's better to secure a guaranteed $100 than to keep trying with Bob and potentially end up with less."
