"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a starting point, aiming to maximize my profit while leaving some room for negotiation. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer that could be mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still higher than selling to John, it is significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiations. There are still 8 rounds left, so I can afford to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer to show some flexibility.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, but I want to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but it's still lower than what I'd like.  There are still six rounds left, so I can afford to be patient and try to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This offer is closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum and John's offer. I believe this could incentivize Bob to accept, especially considering there are only 5 rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and with only four rounds left, the risk of getting a better deal diminishes.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a profit and avoid the potential risk of losing the deal altogether."
