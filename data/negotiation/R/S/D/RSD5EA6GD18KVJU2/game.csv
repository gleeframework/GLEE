"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,500? I'm serious about wanting this product, but I have to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
