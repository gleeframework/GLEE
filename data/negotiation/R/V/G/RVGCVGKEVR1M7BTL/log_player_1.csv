Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, we can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price without revealing our bottom line.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, using phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"". This invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation. 

By starting high and being willing to negotiate, Alice maximizes her chances of either securing a deal significantly above $800,000 with Bob or accepting the guaranteed offer from John."
