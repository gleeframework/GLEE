"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product is only worth $8,000 to her. By rejecting her initial offer, you might prompt her to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
