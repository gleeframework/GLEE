Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a bit higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation but also ensuring a good profit if accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$130 is closer to my minimum but I can try to get a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully close enough to Bob's offer that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is only slightly less than my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John for a few extra dollars. I'll accept his offer."
