I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting, I'm still confident I can get a slightly higher price with more negotiation. I'm also aware of the potential sale to John for a significantly higher price, which is a strong bargaining chip."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John. We've reached an impasse with Bob, and it's clear he's not willing to budge much further.  Selling to John guarantees me a much higher price, which is more in line with my minimum goal."
