{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's a good compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $50 for the product. Would you be willing to go that low? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low, well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell the product for $50, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $100? That's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you need to make a fair profit too. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a significant price difference for me, but I'm ready to buy if you agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I want for the product. I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to push the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $90.  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth it."", ""product_price"": 90}
