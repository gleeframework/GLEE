{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget ($125 vs your $100 max). It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $95. This is below my maximum budget of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further. I'm willing to pay up to $100, and her offer is $115. There's still room for a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer to $105. This is still within my budget and closer to Alice's previous offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also sets a clear limit."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop the price further, especially since she rejected my counteroffer in the previous round. I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay my maximum budget of $100. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but won't go any higher. If she rejects this, I will buy the product from John for $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $100. I've already made my final offer, and she rejected it.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice, as I'm unlikely to get a lower price. I'll buy the product from John for $100."
