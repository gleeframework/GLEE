"I'm interested in the product, but $950000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $875000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $875000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850000. Can you consider that price?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $850000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $900000. I believe this is the best compromise considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",900000.0,Alice,5,
