{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. With only four rounds left, I don't think I have enough time to push for a higher price.  It's better to take the guaranteed $80 from John than risk ending up with less."
