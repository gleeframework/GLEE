# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
