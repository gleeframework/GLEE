"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially push him to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. If he rejects, I can then lower the price slightly in subsequent rounds. I also have the option to sell to John at any point for my minimum desired price of $15,000, giving me a strong fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial value, it's still significantly less than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price. It's still early in the negotiation, and I have 8 rounds left. I'm hoping to either get Bob to increase his offer or leverage the possibility of selling to John to incentivize a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from $14,000 to $12,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. This counteroffer is a compromise, trying to bridge the gap between our current positions. If Bob accepts, it's a good deal. If he rejects, we can continue the negotiation. Selling to John remains my fallback option, giving me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and continue the negotiation process.  I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of my minimum desired profit.  With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiations.  Selling to John is still a valuable fallback option, providing leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm again lowering my price, but only slightly. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than my minimum. It's a calculated risk, as Bob might reject this offer. However, I have 5 rounds remaining and the option to sell to John, giving me leverage.  I'm hoping to bridge the gap with this offer and hopefully reach a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiations. With 4 rounds left, there's still time to reach a more favorable price. Selling to John is still my fallback option, providing leverage in the negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better deal than $9,800."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a final push towards a deal. I'm lowering my price to $10,500, which is closer to Bob's offer and a compromise on my side.  I have 3 rounds left and still have the option to sell to John, which gives me leverage. This offer is a calculated risk, but I believe it's the best way to get a deal done. If Bob accepts, I secure a decent profit. If he rejects, I can either make a final counteroffer or sell to John in the final rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds remaining, the negotiation has stalled.  Bob's offers are consistently lower than my minimum desired price, and I'm unwilling to compromise further. Given my strong fallback option of selling to John for $15,000, it makes more sense to secure a guaranteed profit than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob in the final round.  I'm prioritizing maximizing my earnings, and selling to John is the best course of action at this point."
