# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget and leaves you with a smaller potential saving. By rejecting the offer, you can see if she'll come down further in price. If her next offer isn't low enough, you can always buy from John for $15,000."
