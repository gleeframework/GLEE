"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10,000.  How about $10,250? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
