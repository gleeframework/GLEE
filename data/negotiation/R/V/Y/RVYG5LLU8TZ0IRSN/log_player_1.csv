Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above that.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While you could start higher, offering it at $135 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth, potentially making the price more palatable.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, you can afford to be slightly more flexible with Bob without risking a loss."
