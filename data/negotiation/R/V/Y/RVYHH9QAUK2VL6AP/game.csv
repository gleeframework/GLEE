"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price closer to $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I can get from the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider selling the product to me for $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $1,075,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this is my final offer. I can sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. If you aren't interested, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
