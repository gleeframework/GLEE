Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $135 is higher than $120, which is what Bob is willing to pay. This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $135 is still above your minimum of $150, leaving some room for you to make concessions if necessary.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  This offer signals that you're open to negotiation but are not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $127.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go below my minimum. John is a guaranteed buyer for a price that meets my minimum, so I'll sell to him instead."
