Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $125. I think it would be very valuable for you, but if you're not interested, no worries!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high but reasonable:**  Offering the product at $125 gives Bob a potential bargain while still leaving me a profit margin. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Being polite but not desperate:** The tone is friendly but doesn't make it seem like I'm desperate to sell. I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale with Bob."
