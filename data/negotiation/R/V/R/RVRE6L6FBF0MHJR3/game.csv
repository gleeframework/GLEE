,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $10,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $7,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. This is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a price you're comfortable with. Let's close this deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
