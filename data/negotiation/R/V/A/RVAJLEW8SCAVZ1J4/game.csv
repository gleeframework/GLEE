"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a high-quality item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $150. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $200 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. Let me make you a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $180. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering its value to me is at least $150. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $180 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $100.  This is a fair price considering my budget and your need to sell the product. Let me know if you're willing to work with me.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $100. Let me think for a moment... Ah, I can do better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $140. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and my need to sell the product. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
