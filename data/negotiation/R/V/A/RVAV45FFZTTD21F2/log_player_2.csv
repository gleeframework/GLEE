"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since you have 10 rounds, you have ample time to see if Alice is willing to come down.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This will gauge her willingness to negotiate and hopefully lead to a more favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down a bit, but $920,000 is still above my target. It's too early to accept, and I want to see if I can get her lower. I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the last round.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a lower price.  We're getting closer, and I want to see if Alice will meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, but $900,000 is still too high. I'm going to counter again and see if I can get her closer to my target.  With 5 rounds left, we have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly again, showing Alice I'm getting closer to her price. We're nearing the middle ground, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has held firm at $900,000.  While I'd still prefer a lower price, I've reached a point where accepting this offer is the most sensible choice.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk that Alice might raise her price if I keep rejecting.  It's better to secure the product at this price rather than risk missing out altogether or having to pay the full $1,000,000 to John."
