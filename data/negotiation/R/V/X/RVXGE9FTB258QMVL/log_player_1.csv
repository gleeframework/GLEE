{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price of $12,000, which could make Bob more likely to accept. However, it still leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$6,000 is way too low for me. I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $8,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, I'm working with a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is closer to your offer. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 8000}
