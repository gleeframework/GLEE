"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product given its value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I value this product, $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which reflects a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,125,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
