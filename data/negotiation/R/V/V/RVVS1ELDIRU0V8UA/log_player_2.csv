"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is your maximum price, and you want to save money. There's no benefit to accepting her offer immediately.  Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product given its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Rejecting her offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.  While buying from John is an option, you're still hoping to save some money by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I value this product, $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which reflects a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,125,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is within your budget and represents a good compromise.  You've managed to negotiate a price lower than her initial offer, saving you $75,000.  While further negotiation is always possible, the risk of her rejecting your offer and then potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential gain of a few more dollars in savings."
