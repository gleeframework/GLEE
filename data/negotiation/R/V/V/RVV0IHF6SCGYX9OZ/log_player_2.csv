"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price. You have 10 rounds and a fallback option with John, so there's no need to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $105? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a lower price, and I have 7 rounds left before I need to consider buying from John.  Let's see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $107.50. That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $108.50?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $108.50 is within my budget, and I've already rejected a few offers. It's getting close to my maximum price, and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer from Alice. It's time to accept and close the deal."
