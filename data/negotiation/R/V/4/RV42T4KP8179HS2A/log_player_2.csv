Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down, but I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. This product is a unique opportunity, and I think it's worth the investment. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?
