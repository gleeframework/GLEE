"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done some research and I think it's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I agree it's a good product, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down, but I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. This product is a unique opportunity, and I think it's worth the investment. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
