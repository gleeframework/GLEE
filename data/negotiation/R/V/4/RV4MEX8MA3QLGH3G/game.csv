"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $11000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer you $10500 for it. This is a fair price considering your value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11200. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's unique features and benefits.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11200 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer you $10750 for it, which is closer to our respective valuations. I think this is a fair compromise that would allow us both to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $11050. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",11050.0,Alice,5,
