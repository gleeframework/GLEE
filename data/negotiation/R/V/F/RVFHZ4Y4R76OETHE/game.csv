"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",9500.0,Bob,4,
