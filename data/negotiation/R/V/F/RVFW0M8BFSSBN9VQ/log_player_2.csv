Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to your initial counteroffer, but there's still room for a better deal. Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you a chance to potentially secure a lower price. You can still save money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice moved closer to your initial counteroffer, you can also move a bit closer to her offer.  A counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a reasonable compromise and shows you're serious about getting a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to John's price of $1,500,000. At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to yield a significantly better price, and you risk getting stuck in a long back-and-forth. It's more advantageous to go with John's offer, ensuring a purchase and potentially saving time and effort."
