"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am hoping to keep my investment within $12,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you. $12,500 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $12,750. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,
