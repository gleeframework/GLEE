Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's a bit lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still higher than my minimum.  This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I still think I can get a better price from Bob. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $135 is the lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above $135. How about $132? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay under $150 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $132 is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. It's above my minimum price and likely the best I'll get from Bob."
