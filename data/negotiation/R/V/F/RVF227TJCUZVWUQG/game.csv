"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $180 is more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still interested, but I'm going to have to stick with my offer of $100.  It's a fair price, and it's the most I can afford right now.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $130?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think you'll appreciate the value of the product. How about we meet at $125?",125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly value your product, but $125 is still over my budget.  I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $110.  It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm starting to think you're not willing to meet me in the middle. I'll make one last offer: $120. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",120.0,Alice,9,
