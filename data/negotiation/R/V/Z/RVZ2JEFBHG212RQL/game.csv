"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100 for the product. I really like it, but I'm on a tight budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That's the best I can do.",125.0,Bob,4,
