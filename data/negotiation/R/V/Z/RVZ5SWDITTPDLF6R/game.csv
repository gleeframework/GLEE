,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm happy to negotiate, and I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it, while also staying within my financial constraints.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This price reflects the value I'm willing to compromise on, while still ensuring I get a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my price range. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  This would allow us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
