"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a really great product, and I think you'll get a lot of use out of it. What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $140 just doesn't work for me. How about $155? I'm really trying to make this work, and I think this price is fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",145.0,Bob,6,
