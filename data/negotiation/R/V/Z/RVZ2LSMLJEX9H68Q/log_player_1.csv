"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept, hoping to leave room for negotiation and get a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a really great product, and I think you'll get a lot of use out of it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price that's more in line with my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a bit closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $140 just doesn't work for me. How about $155? I'm really trying to make this work, and I think this price is fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still trying to see if I can get a bit more. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $145 is close to my minimum, it's still a bit lower than what I'd like to get. I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and I don't think I'll be able to get a better price from Bob. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $150."
