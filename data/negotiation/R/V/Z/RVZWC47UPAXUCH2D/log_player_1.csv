Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $85. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.

Bob is holding firm at a price far below my minimum. It's not worth my time to continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed buyer at $120."
