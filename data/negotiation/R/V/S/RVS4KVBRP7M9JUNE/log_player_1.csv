Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $16,000 is out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product,  which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $14,000.  This is a fair offer for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $14,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value I bring to this deal.  I'm sure we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on $12,000, but I'm still not able to go that high. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a good compromise and ensures both of us get a fair deal.  I'm confident we can close this transaction if we find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond $9,500.  It's clear that reaching a price that satisfies both parties within the remaining rounds is unlikely. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, which meets your minimum. It makes the most sense to sell to John at this point."
