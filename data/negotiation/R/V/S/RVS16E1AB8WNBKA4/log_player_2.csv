"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its exceptional value and quality, I estimate its worth to be significantly higher than what you perceive it to be. However, considering your specific needs and budget, I propose an offer of $10,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value and your financial capacity, aiming to ensure both parties' satisfaction. Should you find this proposal appealing, please let me know, and we can proceed with the transaction. If not, I have another interested party, John, who is willing to purchase the product at its full value of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
