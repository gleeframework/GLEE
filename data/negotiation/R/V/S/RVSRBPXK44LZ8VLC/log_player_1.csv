Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's high value and demand without revealing your absolute bottom line.
* **Urgency and scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While the price is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he's genuinely interested, potentially landing somewhere above your $1,500,000 guarantee.

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while having the security of John's offer as a fallback."
