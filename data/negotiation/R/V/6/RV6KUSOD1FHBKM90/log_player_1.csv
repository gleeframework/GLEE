{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, aiming to leave room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the product's value and expressing interest in Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $120 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? That's still a fair price for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a little higher.  I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, Bob might be willing to go even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit.  $125 is still a little too low for me.  How about we compromise at $135? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about $135, but I'm willing to meet you at $130 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $130 is still a bit lower than I'd like, it's getting close to my minimum. I'm going to accept Bob's offer, as it's likely that further negotiation will only delay the sale and potentially lead to a lower price."
