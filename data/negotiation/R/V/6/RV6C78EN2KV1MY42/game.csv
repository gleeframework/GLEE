"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,3,
