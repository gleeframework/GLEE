"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a good price, you can likely get it lower.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $9,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the range of what the product is worth to me. This will hopefully push Alice to negotiate and potentially come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is only $1,000 more than what John is selling it for.  While I could continue to try and negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will counter with a higher price or reject my offer again. At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice, as it minimizes my risk of losing the deal and saves me time."
