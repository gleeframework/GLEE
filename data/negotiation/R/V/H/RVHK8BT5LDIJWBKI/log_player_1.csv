Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can adjust my price downwards, but I want to see if he's truly interested before making any concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a reasonable price point considering my minimum.  I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about selling the product to him, while also demonstrating that I won't undervalue it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far too low. While I'm open to negotiating, his offers show he's not serious about a fair price.  It's better to sell to John for $1,500,000, which is significantly closer to my desired value."
