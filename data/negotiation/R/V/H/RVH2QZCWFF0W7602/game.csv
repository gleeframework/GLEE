"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but $175 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. How about we start at $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $140 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle at $155? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $155 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $150.  That way, we both get a good deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
