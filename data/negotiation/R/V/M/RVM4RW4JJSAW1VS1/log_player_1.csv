Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower your price later.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By starting high, I can gauge Bob's level of interest. If he immediately rejects the offer, I know he's price-sensitive. If he counters, I know he's seriously considering it. 
* **John as Backup:** I have John as a backup buyer who will pay $150, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $180 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $180 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate. Bob's willingness to counter means he's interested, so I want to try to push for a higher price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  How about we meet in the middle at $190?"", ""product_price"": 190}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):** I'm coming down in price to show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue the negotiation. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum of $150.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me understand how much more Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $160 for the product, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $160 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a few dollars more, and there's a risk of Bob walking away entirely.
* **Securing the Sale:** Accepting now guarantees the sale and prevents me from potentially losing both Bob and John as buyers."
