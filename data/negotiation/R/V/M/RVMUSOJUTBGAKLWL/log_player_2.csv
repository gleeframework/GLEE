**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $915,000 - $925,000 mark. While she might budge a little, it's very unlikely she'll come down to a price that beats John's $1,000,000 offer in the final round.  At this point, cutting your losses and taking the guaranteed deal from John is the most financially sound strategy."
