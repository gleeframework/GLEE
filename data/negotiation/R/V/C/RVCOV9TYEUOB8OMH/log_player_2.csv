Given its worth to you, I believe this investment will significantly benefit your endeavors. To ensure we're on the same page, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product at a special introductory price of $14,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget and John's offer.  By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of:

* **Alice lowering her price:** She might be willing to negotiate further to secure the sale.
* **Sticking with John:** You have John as a backup option, ensuring you can still get the product within your budget."
