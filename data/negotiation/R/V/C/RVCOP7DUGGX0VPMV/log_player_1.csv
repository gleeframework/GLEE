Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you have John as a backup, Bob doesn't know that.  The offer implies some scarcity and encourages Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?"") indicating willingness to discuss if Bob counters.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
