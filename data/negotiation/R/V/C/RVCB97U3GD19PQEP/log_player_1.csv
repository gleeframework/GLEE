{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something truly special, and I believe it has immense potential for you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000. This is a significant discount considering its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  A friendly and persuasive message is used to pique Bob's interest. It highlights the product's value and offers a seemingly attractive discount to encourage acceptance.
* **Price:**  The starting price is set at $1,500,000. This is a reasonable initial offer, allowing for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 

**Strategy:**

* **High Starting Price:**  By starting high, Alice sets a baseline for the negotiation and gives herself room to lower the price if necessary.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's worth, creating a sense of potential value for Bob.
* **Discount:**  The mention of a ""significant discount"" creates an illusion of a good deal for Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

Alice will observe Bob's reaction and be prepared to:

* **Accept a Counteroffer:** If Bob counteroffers with a price closer to her minimum, she may accept to close the deal.
* **Make a Counteroffer:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low, Alice will counter with a price closer to her initial offer.
* **Sell to John:** If negotiations with Bob stall or become unproductive, Alice will sell the product to John to ensure a guaranteed $1,000,000 profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

```

**Explanation:**

* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John at this point would guarantee a $1,000,000 profit, but Alice wants to maximize her earnings.

Alice will counter Bob's offer, aiming to secure a price closer to her initial offer while remaining open to finding a compromise."
