This initial offer is a starting point.  It's above my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be high, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1000000 or less. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell it immediately at that price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $1,000,000, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000? This would still be a significant gain for you and would allow me to continue negotiating with you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to compromise, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price closer to $1000000 if possible. Would it be feasible to reach an agreement around this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is stubbornly fixed on $1,000,000. I've already compromised, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm better off selling to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000 than risking further negotiation with Bob that could result in a lower price."
