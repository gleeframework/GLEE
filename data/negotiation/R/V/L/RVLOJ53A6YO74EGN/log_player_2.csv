"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best possible price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a middle-ground offer.  He's offering $1,000 less than Alice's initial price, which shows a willingness to negotiate, but it's still a significant amount below his maximum budget. This should be a tempting offer for Alice, as it's likely closer to her desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, and is still closer to Alice's value than Bob's value. Bob should keep negotiating to try to reach a price closer to his ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is a halfway point between his previous offer and Alice's counteroffer, showing a good faith effort to meet halfway.  This should put more pressure on Alice to accept as she's likely closer to wanting to sell at this price than Bob is to buying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget.  There's no more room for negotiation with Alice, and Bob's chances of getting a lower price from her are extremely low.  At this point, it's better to accept John's offer and close the deal. This ensures Bob gets the product while still staying within his budget."
