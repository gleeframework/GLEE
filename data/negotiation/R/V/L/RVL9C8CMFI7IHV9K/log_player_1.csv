Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a strong opening negotiation position. I'll be ready to adjust based on Bob's response, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get more than $800,000, Bob's offer is already my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from him, and I risk losing out on the deal entirely.  It's better to secure the sale now and avoid further negotiation."
