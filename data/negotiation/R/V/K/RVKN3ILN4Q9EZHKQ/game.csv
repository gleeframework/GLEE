"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway. How about we compromise at $10,500? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we compromise at $9,500? It's still a good price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
