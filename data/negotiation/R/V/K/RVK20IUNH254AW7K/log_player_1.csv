{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique item with significant potential, and I believe this price reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000. This gives you leverage to aim significantly higher with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, suggesting he sees its inherent value. Offering it at a premium price ($1,500,000) positions it as even more desirable or exclusive. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can always come down in price, but you can't go up from your initial offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Financial Capacity:**  While he values the product at $1,000,000, his ability to pay more is unknown. You might want to research his financial standing beforehand if possible.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's a chance Bob rejects a high offer. However, the potential reward for securing a significantly higher price outweighs the risk of going back to your guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
