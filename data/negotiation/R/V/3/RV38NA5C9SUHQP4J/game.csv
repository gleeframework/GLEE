"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value you see in it, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product goes beyond $900,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I understand the value you place on the product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to counter your offer at $1,000,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can move forward with the transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
