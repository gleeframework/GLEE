"Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  There's a significant difference between what Alice is willing to accept ($8,000) and her initial offer, suggesting there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $7,000, which is still a good deal for him, but also leaves some room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also determined to get a better price than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While Bob could try for a lower price, the risk is that Alice will reject the offer and the negotiation could drag on.  At $7,250, Bob is getting a good deal, saving $750 compared to buying from John. Accepting Alice's offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal and ensures a good price."
