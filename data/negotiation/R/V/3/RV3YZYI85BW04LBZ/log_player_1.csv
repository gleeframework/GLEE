Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $8,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that value as possible. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $7,500}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $7,500, which is $500 less than its value to him. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer. Since the product is worth $8,000 to him, I'm not willing to sell it to him for $7,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try to get closer to the true value of the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": $7,250}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $7,250, which is $250 more than his counteroffer. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I've made a new offer to Bob. Here it is:

{""product_price"": $7,250}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or make another counteroffer!"
