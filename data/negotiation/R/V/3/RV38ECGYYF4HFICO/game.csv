"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50? This would be a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. While $82.50 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $78.75?  That would be a fair compromise.",78.75,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer a bit to meet you halfway. How about $77?",77.0,Bob,6,
