Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's in excellent condition and I think you'd really appreciate it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $12,000 is above your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below the product's value to Bob:** $12,000 is less than the $15,000 value Bob places on the product, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price allows for a back-and-forth without immediately hitting your minimum. 

Remember, you can always accept John's offer of $8,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than John's offer, it's still below your desired profit margin. You have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
