"I'm not sure I can go as high as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? That's still a good price for me, and I'm willing to make a decision if we can agree on that.",97.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a little more to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to keep some profit.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
