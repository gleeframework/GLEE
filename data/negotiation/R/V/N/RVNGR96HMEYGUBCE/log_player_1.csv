Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is tempting, but it leaves a significant amount of potential profit on the table. Let's see if we can negotiate a bit further.
