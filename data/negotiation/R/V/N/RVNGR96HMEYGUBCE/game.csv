"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $1,075,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
