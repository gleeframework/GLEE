"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. It's a great deal, as you know the value is substantial. I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's talk."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me to leave room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's worth to Bob, suggesting a strong potential for profit for him. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I invite conversation to gauge Bob's interest and potentially find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his reaction. If the negotiation seems to stall, I'll consider the option of selling to John to ensure a guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob recognizes the product's value, his offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is willing to negotiate, and there's potential to reach a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds.
* **Seeking a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price in subsequent rounds.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I will make a counteroffer, likely somewhere between Bob's offer of $750,000 and my initial offer of $900,000. 
* **Monitoring progress:** I will carefully assess Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly. If the negotiations stall or Bob's offers remain too low, I will consider selling to John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I acknowledge your budget constraints, $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. To continue this negotiation, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the product's true value and still allows for a significant profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential for profit.
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm suggesting that we need to find common ground to keep the negotiations moving forward. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Monitor Bob's Response:** I will analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, I'll need to assess whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John.
* **Adjusting Strategy:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'll need to consider whether to lower my price further or if it's more advantageous to sell to John. I will also consider how many rounds remain before making a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $825,000. This brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement while still allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is only $25,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Accepting Bob's offer leaves room for potential future collaborations, as we have established a good negotiating relationship.
* **Risk of Losing a Deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiations could lead to a stalemate or a lower final price.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer, securing a good deal while also potentially opening the door for future transactions with Bob."
