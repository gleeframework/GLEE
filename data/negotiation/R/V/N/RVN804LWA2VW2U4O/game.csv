"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I acknowledge your budget constraints, $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. To continue this negotiation, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the product's true value and still allows for a significant profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
