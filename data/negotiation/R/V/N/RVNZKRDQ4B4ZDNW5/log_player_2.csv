"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your valuation of the product at $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 might still be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10,000 as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $10,500.  Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed lower price."
