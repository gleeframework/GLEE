{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price closer to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more equitable price. How about $700,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $700,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $700,000 represents a fair valuation of the product. Would you consider $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that we're not close to a mutually agreeable price. It's more profitable for me to sell to John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
