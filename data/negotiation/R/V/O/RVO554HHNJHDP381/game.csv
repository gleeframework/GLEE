"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $105 for it. Let me know what you think!",105.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105. If you're not able to come down to that, I'll have to consider other options.",105.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $112.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's meet in the middle at $110. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to look elsewhere.",110.0,Bob,6,
