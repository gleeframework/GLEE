"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  I'm confident in the value of my product and believe it's worth more than John's offer, so I'm not rushing to sell to him just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better price.  I'm not yet ready to settle for John's offer, as I'm confident I can get more for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above John's offer.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to give away the product for a ridiculously low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than before, it's still significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject his offer and keep trying to negotiate a better price. I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my initial asking price, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm still not ready to accept John's offer.  This offer is closer to Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to raise his offer and get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's getting closer. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up even further. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, and I'm still hopeful that we can reach an agreement that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm starting to feel the pressure to make a deal. This offer is closer to Bob's last offer, and I'm hoping he'll see it as a sign of good faith and come back with a final offer that we can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is finally getting closer to what I'm looking for.  It's only a little bit less than John's offer, and I'm running out of time.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
