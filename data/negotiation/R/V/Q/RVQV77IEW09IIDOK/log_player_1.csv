{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value but still leaves room for negotiation. This initial offer provides a clear starting point for Bob and sets the expectation for a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit steep for me, how about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still slightly below what I'm hoping for. I'm confident that we can reach a more favorable price through further negotiation, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $10,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. "", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,750 is the best I can do.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable value and I'm not confident I can get a significantly higher price through further negotiations.  It's better to secure the sale at this point and move on."
