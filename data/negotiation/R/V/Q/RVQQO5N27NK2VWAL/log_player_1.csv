"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and hopefully get closer to my desired value.
* **Positive Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, potentially sparking his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates I'm open to negotiation, which is essential for a successful negotiation. 

This approach aims to establish a starting point, gauge Bob's interest, and allow for a dynamic negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold:** While Bob's offer is a significant drop from my initial proposal, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Having John's offer of $800,000 gives me the flexibility to continue negotiating with Bob without being forced to accept a subpar offer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to be flexible, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer, but not by too much.
* **Emphasizing value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my price point.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while maintaining a strong stance and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a lower offer of $700000. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  Despite Bob's willingness to negotiate, his offer of $700,000 remains significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Limited time and John's offer:** We're already in round 4, leaving only 6 rounds left to reach an agreement.  John is a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, which is close to my desired value and removes the risk of further negotiation.
* **Potential for further drops:**  There's a real risk that Bob will continue to lower his offer, potentially leading to a worse outcome than John's guaranteed deal.

Given the time constraints, Bob's persistent low offers, and the safety net provided by John's offer, it makes more sense to secure the sale to John and avoid further risk."
