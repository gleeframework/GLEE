Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  I know it's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be worthwhile for you."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a high profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000. This gives me leverage and a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,400,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. It's clear he sees significant value in the product, given his willingness to pay considerably more than my fallback option with John. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and am willing to be flexible to close this deal. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,350,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Compromise:** I've acknowledged Bob's counteroffer and am signaling a willingness to negotiate by making a concession.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By proposing $1,350,000, I'm aiming for a price that represents a fair compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Value Perception:** I haven't dropped the price too drastically, as I want to maintain the perception of the product's high value."
