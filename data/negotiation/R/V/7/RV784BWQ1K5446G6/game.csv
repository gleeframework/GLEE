"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $14500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I'm still not comfortable with $14500. How about we meet in the middle at $15250? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",15250.0,Alice,5,
