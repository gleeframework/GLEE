Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it's below Bob's perceived value but above my minimum acceptable price.  It gives Bob room to negotiate, while also allowing me to potentially earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept it yet. There's still room to negotiate a better price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm confident the product is worth more than $125."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to go through another round of negotiation.  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which might result in no sale."
