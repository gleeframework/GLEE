"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum limit and allows for a comfortable profit for you. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $875,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
