Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $130, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135,  which is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and the original price you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bit more, $132 is still a good price and better than selling to John for $100.  It's time to close the deal!"
