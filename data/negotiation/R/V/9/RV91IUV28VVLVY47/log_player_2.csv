Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's better to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice has lowered her price considerably. At $125, the product is still within your budget and you're saving $50 compared to John's offer.  It's a good deal, so accept it."
