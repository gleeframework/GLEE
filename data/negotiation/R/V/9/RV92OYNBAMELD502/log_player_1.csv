Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""true value,"" you subtly imply that your asking price is justified, even without explicitly listing reasons.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 from John, so there's no risk of losing out completely if Bob rejects the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is a single negotiation round. If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee you can negotiate further with him to reach a deal."
