Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I've seen in similar products. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $1200000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
