# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it holds significant value for you as well.  I'm willing to let it go for $1100000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is simply too low for me to accept at this time. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on this valuable product. How about $1050000? This price still gives you significant value for your investment, while allowing me to meet my financial goals. Let's continue the discussion and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really close to accepting your offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. While $980000 is closer to my goal, I still need to consider the value of this product. How about we settle at $1000000? This would allow us to both walk away happy, with you getting a great deal and me securing a fair price. Let's close this deal.
