"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a good price, it's worth seeing if you can get it even lower. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and improve the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will test the waters and see how much room there is for negotiation.  I'm also trying to leave some room for negotiation, so I'm not going all the way down to my absolute limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still a bit high. I'm going to try to get her down further by making another counteroffer. There are still plenty of rounds left, and I want to see if I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round. I'm trying to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to her, as it's closer to her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but I'm still trying to get a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get her down further. It's important to keep in mind that I have a backup option in John, so I don't have to settle for a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, getting closer to Alice's last price. I believe this is a good compromise. I'm showing Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway, while still saving some money compared to her last offer.  There are still a few rounds left, and I want to give Alice some room to potentially come down further if she needs to, but at this price, I'm feeling confident about closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get the product for a bit less, Alice's offer of $8,300 is getting close to my acceptable price point. With only a few rounds left, it's likely that Alice will not budge further. If I keep rejecting, I risk ending up buying from John at a much higher price.  It's time to secure the deal."
