Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, so I want to get more than that.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Offering $9,000 gives me a chance to make an extra $1,000. There's a risk Bob might reject, but I'm comfortable with that risk since I have a guaranteed $8,000 from John.
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested but thinks $9,000 is too high. I can potentially lower the price a bit if needed."
