Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, it's always better to explore maximizing profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so we need to offer a price lower than his perceived value to entice him. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $950,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters.  
* **Urgency & Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is a starting point.  Depending on Bob's personality and negotiating style, the offer might need adjustments."
