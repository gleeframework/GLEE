Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm looking for a price of $19,000.  This is a great opportunity to acquire it before anyone else. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum ($19,000 vs. $12,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""Given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth this higher price.
* **Scarcity:** Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" creates a sense of urgency and potential competition.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Important:** Even if Bob rejects this initial high offer, you haven't lost anything. You have John as a backup buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
