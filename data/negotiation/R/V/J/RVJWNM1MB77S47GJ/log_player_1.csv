Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why this price?** I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation but also shows Bob that I value the product significantly.
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to maximize my profit while still leaving room for negotiation. By starting high, I can potentially get closer to my desired price, especially if Bob is truly interested. 
* **Next steps:** I'll be prepared to counter any offers from Bob, but will also be ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation stalls or doesn't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.**  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is too far below my minimum. 
* **I believe there's still room to reach a mutually beneficial price.**  I'll counter with a higher offer, hoping to find a middle ground.
* **Selling to John is a strong backup option, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet.** The difference between John's offer and my ideal price is less than the difference between Bob's offer and my ideal price. This means I can afford to be more flexible with Bob.

**Next steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming to find a price that is closer to my desired value while remaining competitive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm lowering my initial offer, but not too much.**  This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I still value the product significantly.
* **The price is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.**  This leaves room for further negotiation, but also demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **I'm hoping to find a middle ground.**  By compromising, I'm hoping to find a price that is acceptable to both of us.

**Next steps:**  I'll wait for Bob's response and be prepared to counter again if necessary. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is getting too low.** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sacrifice too much profit.  
* **The difference between Bob's offer and my minimum is becoming significant.**  This is starting to outweigh the potential benefits of continued negotiations.
* **John's offer guarantees me a good price.**  While I'd ideally like to get more, selling to John ensures I meet my minimum and don't risk losing out on a guaranteed deal.

**Next steps:**  I'll inform Bob of my decision and then finalize the sale with John."
