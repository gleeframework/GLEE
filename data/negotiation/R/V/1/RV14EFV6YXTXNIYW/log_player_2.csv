**Reasoning:**

Alice seems stuck at a price point significantly higher than what you're comfortable with. Her latest offer of $120 is a repeat of her initial offer and indicates she may not be willing to negotiate further down. 

At this stage, continuing the negotiation carries the risk of:

* Wasting time on further back-and-forth.
* Alice potentially holding firm at $120, forcing you to either accept a less-than-ideal price or walk away with nothing.

Buying from John at $150, while not ideal, guarantees you get the product and caps your spending at your predetermined limit."
