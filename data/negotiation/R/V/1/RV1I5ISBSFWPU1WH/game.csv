"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $10,000? I believe this is a fair price, and it would allow both of us to walk away happy.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
