"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for cheaper, and $12,000 is still more than the product's worth to Alice.  It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $10,000? I believe this is a fair price, and it would allow both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $11,000 is still a good price for Bob, and it's likely that Alice won't go any lower.  It's a good deal for both parties."
