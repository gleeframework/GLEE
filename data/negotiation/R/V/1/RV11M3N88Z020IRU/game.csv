"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $8,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your business. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $7,500? That would work well for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's the best I can do. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
