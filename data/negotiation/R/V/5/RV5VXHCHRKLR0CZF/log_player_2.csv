"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than Alice's desired price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $950,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and closer to Bob's maximum budget. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can still choose to buy from John for $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and forcing him to buy from John at $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that's favorable to Bob."
