Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential loss aversion for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a slightly higher sale price than $120."
