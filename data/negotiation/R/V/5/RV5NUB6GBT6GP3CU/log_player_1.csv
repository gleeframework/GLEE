"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This price is high enough that it's unlikely Bob will instantly accept, but low enough that he'll be motivated to counteroffer. This gives me the chance to gauge his interest and potentially secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal at that price, it's still below my desired value. I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1425000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm showing flexibility while also indicating that I'm not willing to drop too far."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. Although Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still secure a more profitable deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on his last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and may encourage him to accept. I'm still above my minimum price and believe this is a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiations with Bob are getting tough. While the offer of $1,350,000 is tempting, I'm worried that we're too far apart and the next few rounds might result in further price decreases. 

To avoid the risk of ending up with a lower price than I'm comfortable with, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,200,000. This secures me a guaranteed minimum value and avoids any potential for a worse outcome."
