Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I mention the product's value to Bob, highlighting the potential benefit for him.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm open to hearing Bob's counteroffer, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if the price isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate, and there's still room to reach a price that's closer to my desired range.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I have the opportunity to secure a higher price.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:**  I'm raising the price slightly to $11,500, which is still lower than my initial offer but above Bob's. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify the price.
* **Seeking compromise:** I'm emphasizing the need for finding a middle ground to signal a willingness to negotiate. 

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation going while ensuring I don't undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's willingness to meet me halfway shows that we're close to an agreement.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I could end up selling to John for a lower price.

Accepting this offer seems like the best option at this point, as it secures a decent price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
