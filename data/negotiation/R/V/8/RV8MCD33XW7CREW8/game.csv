"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's try to find a middle ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
