"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is significantly lower than the value I'm seeking. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still allows for a strong return on your investment while ensuring I can achieve a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
