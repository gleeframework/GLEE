Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit for you. It's also a strong starting point that shows you value the deal but are not desperate to sell.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and professional, highlighting the value the product brings to Bob. It also sets the stage for potential negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

**Strategy:**

By starting at $950,000, you:

* **Maximize your potential profit.**
* **Leave room for negotiation.**  
* **Maintain leverage:**  If Bob rejects your offer, you can always counter with a slightly lower price or choose to sell to John for $800,000.

This approach aims to find a compromise that's beneficial for both parties while ensuring you get the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.** Accepting it would mean losing a substantial amount of money.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a more reasonable price.** This keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a more favorable outcome.
* **Selling to John at this point would be a hasty decision.** While it guarantees $800,000, there's a chance you could get closer to your desired price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** You should counter Bob's offer with a price closer to your initial offer.  You could suggest $850,000 or $900,000, explaining that while you are willing to negotiate, a price significantly lower than your initial offer is not feasible.  

This approach balances the need to secure a good price with maintaining a positive negotiation dynamic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is significantly lower than the value I'm seeking. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still allows for a strong return on your investment while ensuring I can achieve a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $850,000 is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still upholding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** The message is respectful and emphasizes the value for Bob's investment while reminding him of your need for a reasonable profit. It also emphasizes a desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering with $850,000, you:

* **Maintain a solid bargaining position.**
* **Signal your willingness to negotiate.**
* **Keep the door open for a potential deal.**

This approach aims to push the negotiation towards a mutually beneficial outcome, ideally closer to your target price of $950,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is now at your minimum acceptable price.** This means you can secure a sale and get your minimum desired profit.
* **Continuing the negotiation at this point risks the deal falling through.** There's a chance Bob might back out or continue to bargain down, potentially leading to a lower price.
* **Selling to John would achieve the same financial outcome but offers no potential upside.** It's a sure thing, but you could be leaving money on the table.

**Decision:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice. It allows you to secure your minimum desired profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
