"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to invest less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $750,000.  It's a fair price given our respective valuations and would allow us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still hoping to close this deal at a lower price. How about $800,000?  This is a fair offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of $815,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",815000.0,Alice,7,
