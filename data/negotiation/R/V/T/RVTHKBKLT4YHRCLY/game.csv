"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering its value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I agree it's a good product, $9,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
