{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run.  I'm offering it to you for $950,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential return on investment you'll see."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, our goal is to see if we can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * **Bob:**  Saves $50,000 from his perceived value ($800,000) and avoids the risk of missing out.
    * **Alice:** Earns an extra $50,000 compared to selling to John. 
* **Strong Message:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and positions the price as a worthwhile investment."
