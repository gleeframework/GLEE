Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a unique item that I believe would be valuable to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so you won't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a higher offer ($19,000) gives you room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially still land above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, it hints at the product's ""unique"" value, which could justify a higher price in Bob's mind.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy is slightly risky. If Bob is turned off by the high price, he might walk away without counter-offering. 
* You could adjust your initial offer lower (e.g., $17,000) to increase the chance of Bob engaging in negotiation, but this reduces your potential profit margin."
