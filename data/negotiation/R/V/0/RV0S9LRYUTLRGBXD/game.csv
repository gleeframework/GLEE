"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe the proposed price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $650,000 is quite a bit below its true value and what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but it's still a touch high for my budget.  Would you consider $725,000? I feel that's a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working to find a price that works. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial valuation. Would you be willing to agree to $800,000?  That's a significant reduction on my end, and I believe it represents my final offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
