"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in buying it for $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $90 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $92.50. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",92.5,Alice,5,
