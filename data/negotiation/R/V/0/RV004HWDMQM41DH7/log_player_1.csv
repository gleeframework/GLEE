Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You still have room to negotiate if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable price:** It's not too high to scare him off, but it also shows you're serious about selling. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in buying it for $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95, which is still above my minimum and allows for further negotiation if necessary.  It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $90 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $92.50. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing that I'm willing to work with him to find a solution that works for both of us."
