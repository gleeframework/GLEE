"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a good deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
