"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $107 is closer to my budget,  I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $102?  I really want to make this deal work, but I need to stay within my price range.",102.0,Bob,4,
