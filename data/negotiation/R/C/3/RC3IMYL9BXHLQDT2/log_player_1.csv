Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's position:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  Starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't just throw out a number. It emphasizes ""unique value"" and ""other interested parties"" to create a sense of scarcity and desirability. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a bit of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Key:**  This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and she'll need to decide how low she's willing to go while still exceeding her $800,000 minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright, sending Alice to her backup buyer (John). However, the potential reward of a much higher sale price to Bob makes this a risk worth taking."
