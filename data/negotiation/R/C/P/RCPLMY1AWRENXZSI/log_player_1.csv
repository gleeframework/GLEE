"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. It also sets the stage for a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm also testing Bob's level of interest and his willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm offering $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product for cheap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $16,000, which is closer to my initial asking price and definitely worth more than selling to John. I'm willing to close the deal at this point."
