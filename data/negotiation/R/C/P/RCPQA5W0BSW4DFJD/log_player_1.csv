Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $10,000."",
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to go lower.  
* **Strong Starting Point:** Starting at your desired price gives you room to negotiate if Bob counters. 
* **Potential for Success:** While Bob values the product at $8,000, there might be intangible benefits or urgency that could convince him to pay a premium. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't have significant time constraints. If you need to sell quickly, you might consider a slightly lower offer to increase the likelihood of Bob accepting."
