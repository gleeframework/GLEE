Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it right away.  Bob is clearly trying to lowball me. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering with $9,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a healthy profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling but that I also value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has moved slightly from his initial offer, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer more, I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  $8,500 is a reasonable price, and I'll accept his offer."
