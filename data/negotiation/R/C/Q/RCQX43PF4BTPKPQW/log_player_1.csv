Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach $8,000 before time runs out. It's time to secure the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
