"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $7,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you do $8,500?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference again and land on $8,125? That seems like a fair compromise.",8125.0,Alice,5,
