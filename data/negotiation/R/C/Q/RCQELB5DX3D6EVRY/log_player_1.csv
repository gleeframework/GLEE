Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).** This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's lower than Bob's estimated value ($1,500,000).** This makes the offer attractive to him. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.**  It shows that you're willing to work with Bob to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your earnings. If Bob rejects your initial offer, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his response.  You also have the option to sell to John at any time if you feel the negotiation with Bob isn't going well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Make a counteroffer:** You can propose a price closer to your desired range. 
* **Gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate:** His counteroffer indicates he's interested in buying, but his price point suggests he's not yet fully convinced. 

Selling to John at this point would be less profitable than potentially reaching a better agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,300,000 is a good offer, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,375,000?  I think this price is fair considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,325,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer is very close to your desired price range, and it's higher than what John is willing to pay.  It's important to remember that you have a higher value for the product, so even though you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance you won't get a significantly better offer. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale while minimizing the risk of a lengthy negotiation or a lower price from John."
