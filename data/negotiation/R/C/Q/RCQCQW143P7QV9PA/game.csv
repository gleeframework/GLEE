"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $1,062,500?  This shows I'm serious about buying, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1062500.0,Bob,4,
