Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I could try to push for more, Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I could get a better offer from him, and waiting carries the risk of him walking away. Accepting his offer now secures the deal."
