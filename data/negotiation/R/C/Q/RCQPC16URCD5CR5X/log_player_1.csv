"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high to give myself room to negotiate down. Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's a good chance he'll engage in negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** By starting at $1,400,000, I leave Bob feeling like there's a potential deal to be made.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While I have John as a backup, my goal is to maximize profit. Settling for John's offer too early would be leaving money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider something closer to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price. While I want to make a deal, accepting $1,200,000 at this stage would be leaving a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations in terms of value.  How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By suggesting $1,300,000, I'm signaling a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong position. This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Highlighting Value:** I want to reiterate the product's value to Bob. He's already indicated he's willing to pay a significant amount, so emphasizing its potential benefits might sway him towards a higher price. 
* **Time Consideration:** We're still in the early rounds, but I'm conscious of the 10-round limit. Striking a balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal in a timely manner is key."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a number that works for me.  Could you do $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which indicates he's motivated. However, the current offer is still significantly below my target. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can push the price closer to $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product.  Let's find a number we can both agree on. What if we settle at $1,275,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:** I'm proposing a price that's a $25,000 concession on my part but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer.  
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win, highlighting that both parties are making a beneficial agreement.  
* **Maintaining Momentum:** I'm showing flexibility while staying firm on my overall goal of securing a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close. I can appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,240,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,240,000 is a significant improvement from his earlier offers. It's only $60,000 less than my last counteroffer, and accepting now represents a substantial profit.
* **Time is Money:** We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds. While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more, there's a risk that Bob could become frustrated and walk away. Accepting now secures a very good deal. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and potential risk. Accepting this offer allows me to move forward with other business opportunities."
