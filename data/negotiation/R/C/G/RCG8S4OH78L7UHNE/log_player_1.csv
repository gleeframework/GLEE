Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in.  My asking price is $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This initial price allows for potential counteroffers without immediately going below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly message might make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your generosity. However, my budget allows me to spend no more than $10,000 on this purchase. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting would result in a loss for me.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  Rejecting allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value, potentially reaching a compromise.
* **John as a safety net:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage to negotiate more confidently with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm reducing my price but staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the ""great deal"" reinforces the product's worth and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By not going down to $10,000 immediately, I keep some leverage in case Bob rejects this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. Unfortunately, my budget still only allows me to spend up to $10,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further compromise:** Bob has remained firm at $10,000, which is below my minimum.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a higher offer.
* **Secure the higher price:** John is guaranteed to buy the product for $12,000, which is significantly more than Bob's offer.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to more back and forth, wasting time and effort without a guarantee of a better price."
