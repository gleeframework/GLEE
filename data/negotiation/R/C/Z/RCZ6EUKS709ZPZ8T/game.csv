"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Its value to both of us is undeniable. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial proposal.  This product offers immense value, and I believe $1,400,000 is a more appropriate reflection of that. Let's find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
