# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While the price is higher than Alice's value, $12,000 is still less than both your maximum budget ($15,000) and what John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you the most money."
