{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but not ridiculously high. This gives Bob some room to negotiate and allows me to gauge his interest.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to him, hoping to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $10000. Could we possibly come to an agreement at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I need to see if I can get closer to my goal.  I will counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  The product is worth a bit more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I'm confident you'll find it a great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10000. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum price of $12,000, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to accept this offer because it's  a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer from Bob.  Plus, it's better than selling to John for $12,000."
