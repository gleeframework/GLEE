,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? That still gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my target price.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm feeling flexible, though.  Would you be willing to go up to $8,250? That's a good price for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,5,
