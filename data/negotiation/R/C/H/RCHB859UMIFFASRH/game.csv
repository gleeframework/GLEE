"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'll accept $825,000 for the product.  This is still a good value for you, considering its worth to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know your thoughts.",825000.0,Alice,3,
