Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're providing. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider offering the product for $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While your offer is tempting, I'm confident this product is worth a premium. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is very close to Alice's minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely Bob will go much higher and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether.  Accepting the $8,750 offer secures a good profit.
