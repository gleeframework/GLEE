"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I'm willing to consider a compromise and offer it to you for $1800000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.
