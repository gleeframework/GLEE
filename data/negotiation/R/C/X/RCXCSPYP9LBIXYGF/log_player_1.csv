"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves significant room for negotiation in the following rounds, allowing me to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me a floor price. If Bob doesn't come close to that, I can always switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my starting price and well below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a low price this early in the process.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price, but I'm still maintaining a significant margin.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and see how much higher he's willing to go.
* **Avoiding John:** I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is slightly higher than the previous one, it's still significantly below my desired value and my safety net with John.
* **Opportunity for More:** With several rounds remaining, I believe I can get a more favorable price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Risk of John:**  While selling to John is always an option, I'm not yet ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob."

* **Closing the Gap:** This offer is close to John's price, making it a more compelling option for Bob than the previous offers.
* **Final Push:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to entice Bob into accepting, as we are approaching the middle of the negotiation rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Not Enough:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Time is Ticking:** We're in the middle of the negotiations, and time is running out. I need to see if I can push Bob further.
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John is tempting, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal with Bob."

```

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are down to the final few rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Uncertainty:** Bob's offers have been consistently below my expectations, and I'm not sure if he will ever come close to my desired price. 
* **John's Guarantee:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my floor price and a safe alternative to potentially losing more time with Bob. 

Given the limited time remaining and the uncertainty around Bob's willingness to meet my price, I'm choosing to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
