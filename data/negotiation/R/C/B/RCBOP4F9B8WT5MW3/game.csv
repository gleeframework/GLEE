"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While it seems interesting, $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $95? That feels like a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $105. It's still a good price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a fair compromise.",105.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I still need to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $108. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering.",108.0,Alice,7,
