Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it to other interested parties.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,300,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing your profit.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested parties, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, pushing Bob to decide quickly. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a price he might consider, given the product's potential value to him."
