"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I think you'll find it's well worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $9,750. I'll offer the product to you for $10,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
