"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still exceeding your target. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique features"" and ""potential for Bob's business,"" we aim to anchor the value proposition in Bob's mind, justifying the high initial price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  We want to appear flexible and willing to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage in the conversation rather than immediately rejecting the offer.
* **Alternative Option (John):**  Knowing we have John as a backup buyer at our desired price provides leverage. We don't mention John explicitly, but it gives us the confidence to aim high and potentially walk away if the deal isn't favorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,300,000 is far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it. This is my maximum offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is far below our minimum acceptable price. While he claims it's his maximum, there's a high likelihood he has room to negotiate. We'll reject this offer to signal that we're serious about a higher valuation and encourage him to move closer to our range. We still have ample rounds to negotiate and the security of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below its market value and what I'm looking to receive for this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a substantial concession on my part, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and his budget constraints while making it clear his initial offer is unacceptable.
* **Significant Drop, But Still High:** The  $300,000 reduction signifies flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the $2,000,000 price remains well above both our minimum and Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""market value,"" we're subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth beyond just his individual assessment.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  We reiterate our desire to find a solution that works for both parties, encouraging Bob to engage constructively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $2,000,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Enough:** Bob's offer has increased significantly, which is positive. However, $1,000,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation moving and allows us to gauge how much further Bob is willing to go. 
* **John Option Still Viable:** We are not desperate to accept a low offer as we have the safety net of selling to John for our desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about reaching an agreement, and I appreciate that.  Your offer moves us closer, but we're still not quite there yet.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to consider $1,700,000.  This is a significant move on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal considering the product's true value."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We want Bob to know we recognize his efforts and movement towards a compromise.
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** By offering $1,700,000, we're signaling a willingness to meet closer to the middle ground between his last offer ($1,000,000) and our previous ask ($2,000,000). However, we're still slightly favoring our side. 
* **Final Push:**  This counteroffer aims to encourage Bob to make a significant jump closer to our acceptable range. It's getting to the point where we need to see substantial movement from him to continue prioritizing this deal over John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement Stalling:** Bob is still negotiating, which is a good sign, but his offer increments are getting smaller.  We need to assess if there's enough room for him to reach our minimum.
* **Approaching the Halfway Point:** While $1,200,000 is a significant improvement from his initial offer, it's still less than halfway between his starting point and our target.
* **Leverage of John:** We have a strong alternative with John, and with fewer rounds remaining, we can apply more pressure.  Bob needs to understand we're willing to walk away if necessary."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we need to find a solution that works for both of us. Your offer is moving in the right direction, but it's still a considerable distance from my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're making it clear this is our final offer to create a sense of urgency and signal we're unwilling to go much lower.
* **Slight Concession:** We're coming down slightly from our $1,500,000 minimum to $1,550,000 as a show of good faith and to incentivize Bob to finalize the deal.
* **Justification and Time Pressure:** We're reiterating the product's value while subtly introducing time pressure by positioning this as a ""take it or leave it"" offer. 
* **Alternative (John):**  With only a few rounds left, we're subtly reminding Bob of our alternative option. If he doesn't accept this offer, we're prepared to walk away and sell to John."
