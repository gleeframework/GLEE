"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,300,000 is far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it. This is my maximum offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below its market value and what I'm looking to receive for this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a substantial concession on my part, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $2,000,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about reaching an agreement, and I appreciate that.  Your offer moves us closer, but we're still not quite there yet.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to consider $1,700,000.  This is a significant move on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal considering the product's true value.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground here.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we need to find a solution that works for both of us. Your offer is moving in the right direction, but it's still a considerable distance from my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product brings.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
