"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a little higher than my minimum, but still within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for my minimum just yet. I have 9 more rounds and can try to push for a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, I'm looking for a bit more. How about $105? That still gives you a good deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 
I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer. This shows Bob that I'm flexible, but I'm not willing to settle for his first counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $105 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $102.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, I'm still not willing to settle for that price. I'll try to get him to move a little closer to my target by countering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's split the difference this time. How about $103.75? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 103.75} 
``` 
I'm lowering my offer slightly again, but I'm still aiming for a price that's more than my minimum. I'm also highlighting the fact that this is a fair price for both of us, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $103.75 is the best deal for me. I'm still thinking $100 is a fair price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on $100, and I'm getting close to my minimum.  I'm running out of rounds, and it seems like I won't be able to get much more from Bob.  It's better to secure the sale with John for $100 than risk losing everything by continuing to negotiate."
