"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, I believe a price of $1500000 is slightly above what I'm currently willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product while still being a fair amount for both of us. Would you be open to discussing this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
