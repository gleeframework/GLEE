"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offer of $150 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100 and John's offer. There is plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for further negotiation if she completely rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still above your budget and what John is offering. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand we're trying to find a fair price. How about $95? That's closer to the middle ground."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

This counter offer:

* Shows willingness to compromise but stays firm on being below $100.
* Is a significant jump from $80, indicating you're serious but still want a good deal.
* Leaves Alice room to counter if she's absolutely unwilling to go below $100."
