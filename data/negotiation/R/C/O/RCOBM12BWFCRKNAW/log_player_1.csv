Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $9,500 leaves room for potential negotiation without immediately hitting Bob's ""no"" threshold. 
* **Focusing on Value:**  My message highlights the product's potential value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.

This approach strikes a balance between being assertive and leaving space for a mutually beneficial deal. If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and counter-offer accordingly, always keeping John's $10,000 offer as a backup."
