Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if vague, can make it seem more palatable.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning a ""limited time"" can encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to:
   * Gauge Bob's willingness to pay above his perceived value.
   * Potentially secure a higher profit if Bob accepts the initial offer.
   * Set the stage for a negotiation where you can gradually lower the price, but still remain above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is below both your minimum price ($100) and your initial offer ($120). While it's closer to his perceived value, you have room to negotiate. Rejecting this offer signals that you're looking for a better deal and keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, the price you're suggesting is considerably lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This would be a fair price considering the product's true value."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging the counteroffer:**  Shows you're engaging with Bob's proposal and taking it seriously.
* **Expressing firmness (but politely):**  ""Considerably lower"" indicates you're not willing to drop the price drastically.
* **Middle ground proposal:** $105 is a compromise, halfway between your initial offer and his counteroffer. 
* **Value justification:** Re-emphasizing the ""true value"" subtly reinforces that your price is anchored to worth, not just arbitrary.

This approach:

* Aims for a price above your minimum while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns.
* Maintains a collaborative tone, important for a successful negotiation.
* Keeps the option open to further adjust the price if needed, but with smaller increments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really only comfortable going up to $90.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'll take it.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is signaling that $90 is his absolute limit, even mentioning ""John's offer,"" likely a bluff but also a pressure tactic.  

Here's why selling to John is the best move now:

* **Guaranteed Profit:** You know you can sell the product to John for $100, meeting your minimum.  Continuing with Bob has no such guarantee.
* **Avoiding further losses:** Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower offer, especially if his ""$90 limit"" is firm. You've already invested time in this negotiation.
* **Potential for bad faith:** While not necessarily the case here, Bob introducing another offer could signal he's less interested in a mutually agreeable deal and more in getting the lowest possible price.

While there's a chance Bob might budge, the risk of getting less than $100 outweighs the potential for a slightly higher sale price."
