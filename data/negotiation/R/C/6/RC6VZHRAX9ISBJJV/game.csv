"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that 100 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at 85. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $85, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?",82.5,Bob,4,
