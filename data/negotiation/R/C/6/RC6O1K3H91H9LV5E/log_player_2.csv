"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget, so it's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left, providing ample opportunity to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to invest in this product for a slightly lower price point.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it, given its potential benefits and my overall budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate and aiming to quickly find a middle ground.
* **Justification:** Bob highlights the product's potential and his budget constraints to make the counteroffer more persuasive. 
* **Open to Compromise:** The message leaves room for further negotiations, indicating Bob's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I can't accept anything less than $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob has 7 rounds remaining to try and push the price lower. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process. It might lead to Alice lowering her price further, especially if she wants to close the deal quickly. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While buying from John is always an option, Bob wants to try and get the product at a price closer to his desired range."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge the value of this product,  $1,350,000 is still slightly out of my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to invest in this opportunity and you to secure a sale."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:**  This counteroffer is a smaller step than the previous round, demonstrating a more reasonable approach and a willingness to come closer to Alice's position.
* **Focus on Compromise:** Bob emphasizes the idea of ""meeting in the middle"" to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness and encourage her to accept a compromise.
* **Maintain Momentum:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and leaves room for further discussion if necessary."
