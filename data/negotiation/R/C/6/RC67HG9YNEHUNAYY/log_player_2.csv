# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget of $8,000.  It's not even close to your maximum of $8,000.  It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my maximum. Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above my budget. While it's closer to my maximum of $8,000, it's still a significant difference. I'm going to try and get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not convinced that $9,500 is a good price for the product. I'm willing to consider a slightly higher price, but I need to think about the value it will bring to your business. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still significantly higher than my budget of $8,000. It seems like we are not going to be able to reach an agreement on price. I'm better off buying the product from John for $8,000, which is within my budget and saves me money in the long run."
