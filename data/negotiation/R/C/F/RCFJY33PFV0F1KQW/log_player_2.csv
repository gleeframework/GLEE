Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $14,000? I believe that's a fair price considering the value this product brings.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to consider it if we can meet somewhere in the middle. Would you be open to $12,500? This would allow me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. It seems we're getting close.  I'd be willing to come down slightly to $11,750.  This is truly as low as I can go while still feeling good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is very unlikely to go below $11,750.  At this point, it's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John for $12,000. You've already spent time negotiating, and further haggling might not yield a better result than your backup option."
