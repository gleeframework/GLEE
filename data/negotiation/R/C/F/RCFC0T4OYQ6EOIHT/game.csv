"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $110? This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $150 to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $97.50 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,6,
