# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product! We're excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $900,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. 
* You have a higher maximum budget than Alice's minimum selling price, so there's potential to strike a deal within your range.
* It's worth exploring further negotiation rounds to see if you can secure a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This price is within my budget and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is closer to your desired price, but it's still a bit high. 
* You're aiming for a lower price, and since you have more room to maneuver within your budget, it's worth pushing for a better deal.
