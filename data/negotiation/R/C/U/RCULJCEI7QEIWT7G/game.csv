"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $16,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you do $9,000? I think that's a fair offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try this - $12,000 and we have a deal. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
