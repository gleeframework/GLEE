Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $16,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try this - $12,000 and we have a deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down to her minimum price ($12,000) which is still above your maximum budget. It's unlikely she'll go any lower. You have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000.  There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice."
