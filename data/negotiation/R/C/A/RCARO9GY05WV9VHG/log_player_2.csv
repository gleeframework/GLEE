"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll love it! As we've discussed, this product is truly one-of-a-kind and has immense value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $850,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than he wants to pay. He can try to negotiate further by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gotten a much lower price than Alice's initial offer and a better price than John's offer.  At this point, he's likely to save more money by accepting and moving on than by trying to negotiate further.  There is a chance he could get a slightly lower price, but it's not likely."
