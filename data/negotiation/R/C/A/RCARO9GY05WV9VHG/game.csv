"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I'll receive from the product, and it allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
