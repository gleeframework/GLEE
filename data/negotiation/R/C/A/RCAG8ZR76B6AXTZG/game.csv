"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial returns you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This offer reflects a more realistic price point while acknowledging the value you'd be gaining.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
