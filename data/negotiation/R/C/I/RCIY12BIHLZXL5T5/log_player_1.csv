Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800000. Would you consider reducing the price to $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I will counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $960000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $960,000 is getting close to my desired price, I think I can push for a bit more.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet, so I'll counter Bob's offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer.  $960,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $965,000.  This is my final offer, so let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 965000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a final price of $962500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, Bob's offer of $962,500 is a reasonable compromise. We've been negotiating for a while, and it's likely we won't get much closer. I'm happy to close the deal and avoid selling to John at a lower price."
