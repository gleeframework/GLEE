Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise. I'm willing to make a deal at $1,150,000. This offer stands until [Set a reasonable deadline], after which I have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible while still making a significant profit above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning a deadline and another buyer (John), you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Deadline:** The deadline should be short enough to create urgency but not so short that it seems unreasonable. 
* **Bob's Personality:** Consider what you know about Bob's negotiating style. If he's known to be aggressive, you might want to start with a slightly higher price."
