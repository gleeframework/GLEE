"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential return on investment for you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This offer reflects my maximum budget and what I believe is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident this product will be profitable for me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's potential.  To be frank, $850,000 is significantly below its true market value and what I'm willing to accept.  I'm open to finding a compromise, so I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects a more reasonable middle ground.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go a bit higher than my initial offer.  How about $1,100,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my part and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in price and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,100,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from what I had in mind. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,600,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value I'm offering.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about $1,300,000? This feels like a fair midpoint for us and a price I can comfortably work with. I believe this deal is mutually beneficial, allowing you to sell the product and me to acquire it at a price that's both reasonable and profitable. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
