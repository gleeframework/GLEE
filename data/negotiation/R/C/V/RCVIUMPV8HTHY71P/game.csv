"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer the product to you for $10,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good middle ground. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  $10,250 is a bit closer, but I'm aiming to stay closer to $9,000. Could you do $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.
