"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, it's still above his $8,000 limit.  He'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, as that's the maximum I can go right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $8,500.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his limit of $8,000. While $9,000 is a better price than the initial offer, it's still not within his ideal range.  He'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,875. This is a very fair price for both of us.  I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,875 is the closest Alice has come to Bob's $8,000 target, Bob is still hesitant to accept. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate and knows he has the option of buying from John for a lower price. Bob wants to push for a price closer to his limit, knowing there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $8,800? It's a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal on this price."", ""product_price"": 8800}
