"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, as that's the maximum I can go right now. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $8,500.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,875. This is a very fair price for both of us.  I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment.",8875.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $8,800? It's a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal on this price.",8800.0,Bob,6,
