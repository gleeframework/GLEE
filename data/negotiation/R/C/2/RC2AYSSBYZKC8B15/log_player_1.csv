"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value of $120. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my minimum value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is higher than my minimum value of $120 and it's likely he won't go higher. It's a good deal for me to accept."
