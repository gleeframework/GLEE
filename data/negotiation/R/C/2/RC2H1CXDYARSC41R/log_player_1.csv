Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175.  This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price considering his initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up higher. I'm not sure how much more he's willing to pay, but I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm offering $160. This is a compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will recognize that it's a fair price, considering his previous offer.  I'm still making a decent profit, and it's a better deal than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $140 is closer to my desired price, it's still not quite what I was hoping for.  At this point, I'm running the risk of going back and forth with Bob for too long. I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John."
