"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $650,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer at $900,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in talks. I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $850,000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle if you're willing to meet me halfway",850000.0,Alice,5,
