Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and highlights the perceived value to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussion, allowing for a potential counteroffer.

**Strategy:** 

* By starting high, I aim to secure a higher price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer, potentially lowering the price slightly, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.
* If negotiations stall or become unproductive, I can always walk away and sell to John for my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000, and even below the value to Bob of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, even though he rejected my initial offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value or a compromise that is more beneficial to me. 
* **Plan B:** I'm keeping the option of selling to John open, but I'm optimistic that I can get a better price from Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer at $10,000:**  This price is still above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my initial offer. It shows I'm willing to compromise while still getting a price closer to my desired value.
* **Focus on Fair Price:** The message highlights the price as being fair for both parties, emphasizing the potential for a win-win outcome. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm reiterating my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us, keeping the door open for further discussion.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a compromise that is closer to my minimum value.
* **Building Trust:** By being open to negotiation and focusing on fairness, I hope to build trust with Bob and make him more likely to accept my counteroffer.
* **Plan B:**  I'm still keeping the option of selling to John open as a backup plan if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
