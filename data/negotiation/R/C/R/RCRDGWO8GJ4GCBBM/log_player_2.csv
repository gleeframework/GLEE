"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum price and what John offers. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with a lower offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Justification:** While not strictly necessary, giving a brief reason (even if it's just that the price is too high) can make your position feel more considered. 

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but it's important to leave room for further negotiation. It will be interesting to see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $8,500 to make this work. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but her offer is still higher than John's.  There's room for further negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a better price and are willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a significant increase from my last offer and would allow us both to walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer shows a willingness to compromise and move closer to Alice's price.
* **Middle Ground:** Aiming for the middle ground is a common negotiation tactic. It suggests fairness and can help reach an agreement faster.
* **Positive Framing:**  Highlighting the positive aspects (a win-win situation) can make the offer more appealing.

By offering $7,500, you're still below John's price while showing Alice that you're serious about making a deal. It remains to be seen if she'll accept this offer or continue to negotiate."
