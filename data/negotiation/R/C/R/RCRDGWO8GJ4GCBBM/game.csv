"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $8,500 to make this work. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a significant increase from my last offer and would allow us both to walk away happy.",7500.0,Bob,4,
