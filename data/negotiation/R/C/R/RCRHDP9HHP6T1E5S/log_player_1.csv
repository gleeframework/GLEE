Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond your initial assessment."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob.  While $9,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. I'm confident this price reflects the true value you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```
Reasoning: Accepting $11,250 is a reasonable compromise at this stage. It exceeds my minimum price and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether by pushing for more.
