"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, but no higher. Can you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,4,
