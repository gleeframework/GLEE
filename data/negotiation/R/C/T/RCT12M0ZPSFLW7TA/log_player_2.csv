# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you the chance to purchase a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. While I won't disclose the details just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  I'm willing to let it go for a price that's very attractive, considering its potential.
