"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think the product is interesting, but I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial price. How about $10,500? This gives us both room to negotiate further.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to accept $9,800.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $10,200? That's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,900 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",9900.0,Bob,6,
