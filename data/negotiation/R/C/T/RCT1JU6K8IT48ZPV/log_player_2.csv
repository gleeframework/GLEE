"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm starting at $900,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is valuable, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($700,000) than Alice's initial price ($900,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Polite and Professional:**  The tone remains respectful and collaborative, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** I'm not rejecting Alice outright but inviting her to consider my counteroffer and continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth a lot, and I'm confident it will generate significant value for you. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice came down in price, $850,000 is still above our $800,000 maximum budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are several rounds left, suggesting Alice might be willing to negotiate further.
* **John as Backup:** We have the option to buy from John for $800,000, giving us leverage."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  This feels like a fair price that reflects the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer, but in a smaller increment ($75,000) than Alice's previous decrease, signaling willingness to move but also demonstrating that I'm price-conscious.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This language suggests fairness and compromise, potentially making the offer more appealing to Alice.
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reminding Alice that the price should ""reflect the value of the product,"" which may encourage her to be more realistic in her expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $775,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing In:** Alice is getting closer to our $800,000 limit, but we still have room to negotiate.
* **Time Remaining:** We're at Round 5 with 5 rounds left. We have time for a few more back-and-forths. 
* **John Option:**  The safety net of John's offer allows us to continue pushing for a better deal from Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, this product has great potential. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000 even. I think that's a really fair price and shows how serious I am about acquiring this product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** This offer is our maximum budget.  
* **Show Seriousness:** By reaching our limit, we signal strong interest and seriousness about the purchase.
* **Time for a Decision:** Offering our final price now gives Alice time to seriously consider it over the remaining rounds.  If she's unwilling to accept $800,000, we can still buy from John."
