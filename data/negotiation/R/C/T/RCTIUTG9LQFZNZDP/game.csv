"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $800000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. My initial price is $2000000, which reflects its significant value. I'm open to discussing this further, so let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000, which still gives you a substantial value gain.  Let's keep the negotiation moving forward, I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1700000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make a profit",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $1400000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and settle on $1550000? This price is fair for both of us, allowing you to make a healthy profit while giving me a reasonable return.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on this round.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $1400000. I think that's the maximum I can afford for this product. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buying it from you, but I need to be realistic about my budget. Can you consider meeting me at $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
