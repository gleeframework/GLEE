Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I have to say that $11,000 is already a very competitive price for this product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $10,800, which is a good deal for you. You're saving $1,200 compared to buying from John, and you're only $800 above your ideal price. It's worth accepting the offer."
