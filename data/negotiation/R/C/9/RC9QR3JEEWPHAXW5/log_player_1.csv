Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

At this point, Bob is not budging from his $1,200,000 offer. It's clear that going back and forth isn't going to get me a number I find acceptable.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome and prevents me from potentially losing even more in a protracted negotiation."
