"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible.

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $10900. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $11200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.
