Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also higher than the product's value to Bob, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a great deal for Bob, highlighting its value to him. This could potentially encourage him to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a slightly aggressive price to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his responses and my willingness to continue negotiating. I have the option to stop negotiations at any time and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to meet in the middle.  This allows me to potentially secure a higher price while still demonstrating flexibility.  I'm confident in my ability to get a better price through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've reduced my price to $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. It shows flexibility and signals my willingness to reach a deal.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness and compromise aspect of my counteroffer. I'm also highlighting the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement, which could encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer strategically aims to meet Bob halfway. It's likely to be more appealing than my previous offer while still remaining above Bob's initial counteroffer. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward while increasing my chances of securing a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $925,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to earn closer to $1,200,000, continuing to negotiate carries the risk of losing the deal with Bob entirely and having to settle for John's offer.  

**Strategy:**

It's important to weigh the potential gains from further negotiation against the risk of losing a sale altogether.  In this case, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that is reasonable and significantly higher than the value of the product to him. This decision minimizes risk while still securing a respectable profit."
