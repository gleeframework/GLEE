Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** It's always better to start with a higher price and negotiate down if needed.  This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to get a price closer to your ideal.
* **Leave Bob room to negotiate:** Offering a price slightly above his perceived value might encourage him to counter-offer, leading to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Have a backup plan:** You know John will buy the product for $80, so you have a guaranteed minimum sale price. This gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob."
