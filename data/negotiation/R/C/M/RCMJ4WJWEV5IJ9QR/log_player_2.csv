"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to pay $100."
