Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is closer to my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize Profit:** I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum as possible.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have room to negotiate further without selling for less than my minimum.
* **Maintain a good relationship:** A positive tone encourages cooperation and makes it easier to negotiate later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for negotiation:** While $11,000 is not ideal, I can still potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Not desperate:** I have a backup option with John who is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** I can control the negotiation and potentially get a better price.
* **Explore possibilities:** I can continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can find a middle ground.
* **Ensure a better outcome:** Ultimately, I want to maximize my profit, and accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  By not accepting his initial offer, I've shown that I'm not desperate and am willing to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $12,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a great deal for him. 
* **Positive Tone:** A positive tone encourages further negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:** I'm trying to get as close to my minimum as possible while keeping the negotiation open.
* **Maintain Control:** I'm still in the driver's seat and can adjust my counteroffers based on Bob's responses. 
* **Increase the Chances of Agreement:**  A reasonable counteroffer increases the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable price."
