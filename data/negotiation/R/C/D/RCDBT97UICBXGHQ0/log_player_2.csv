Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation and shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal.

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not willing to accept it.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if I can get Alice to come down further. If this doesn't work, I'm prepared to go with John's offer."

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but this time it's only a small increase.  I'm trying to find the sweet spot where Alice is willing to accept a price that's still within my budget.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll likely go with John's offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting very close to my budget, I'm going to try to push for one more round of negotiation. I'm confident that I can get her down to a price closer to $800,000. If this doesn't work, I'll be happy to accept her offer, but I want to exhaust all options before going with John."
