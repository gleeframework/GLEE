"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a high baseline for the negotiation and leaves room for potential concessions.
* **Importance of the Product:** Since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'm aiming for a significant profit.
* **Unknown Value to Bob:** I don't know how much Bob values the product, so I need to test the waters. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own.
* I'll keep the $1,000,000 offer from John in mind as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:**  $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's counteroffer is unfavorable, it shows he's interested in the product. This gives me an opportunity to negotiate a better price.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:**  While $1,000,000 from John is a guaranteed sale, I'm willing to risk it for a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll need to carefully consider a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but also leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have 8 rounds left to try and reach a mutually acceptable price."
