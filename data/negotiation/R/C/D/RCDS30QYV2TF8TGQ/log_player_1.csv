Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I think it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're getting more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** It leaves room for negotiation and suggests you're open to a deal.
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you're confident in the product's value.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $11,000, you're better off holding out for a better deal. John is a solid backup option, but you can likely get a higher price from Bob.  Let's counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $13,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

This counteroffer is still above your minimum but shows you're flexible and willing to negotiate. It also keeps the pressure on Bob to come up with a better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $13,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget.  Could we settle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is your minimum price, and while you could potentially counteroffer again, there's no guarantee of a better offer.  It's likely that if you reject this offer, Bob will walk away, and you'll be stuck selling to John for the same price.  It's best to accept Bob's offer and secure the deal."
