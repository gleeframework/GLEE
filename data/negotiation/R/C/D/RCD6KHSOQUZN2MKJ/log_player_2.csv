# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1500000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your portfolio. Consider this offer carefully, as I'm confident another buyer is ready to acquire it at the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and John is selling the product for the same price as Alice, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You can get the same product for the same price from John."
