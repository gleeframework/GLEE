"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1000000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800000. I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done, but I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist this offer. What do you think?
