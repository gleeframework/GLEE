"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1700000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and offered you a great deal at $1700000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is my final compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
