"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident in my ability to get a better price.  I'll counter with a lower price and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000, which is still above Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired price.  I believe this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob while still being advantageous for me."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still keeping it above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,450,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer but I'm hoping that it will be enough to incentivize Bob to accept the offer. We're getting closer to a deal and I'm confident that I can secure a price that is close to my desired amount."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time and Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower.  I'm not confident that I can secure a better deal with him in the remaining rounds. Selling to John at $1,500,000 ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation."
