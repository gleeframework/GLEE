"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You know John will sell you the same product for $1,200,000. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for you to buy from John and save $200,000."
