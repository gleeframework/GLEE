"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$110:** This price is a starting point, aiming to secure a good deal while still being open to negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but allows room for compromise.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making the offer more appealing. 

**Strategy:**

* This initial offer sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room to lower the price if necessary. 
* I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on how close it is to my desired price point. 
* If negotiations stall or become unproductive, I can always fall back on selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Accepting Bob's offer would leave me with less profit than selling to John.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired $100. This keeps the negotiation going and allows me to test Bob's flexibility.
* **John as backup:** I'll keep John as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$95:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum. 
* **Message:**  I'm staying friendly and emphasizing the value of the product while suggesting a compromise. 

**Strategy:**

* **Midpoint Approach:**  By offering the midpoint, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and hopefully encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price. 
* **Confidence in Value:**  Reiterating the product's worth helps reinforce the value of the price.
* **Flexibility:** If Bob still rejects, I'm prepared to make another counteroffer depending on how close he is to my minimum.
* **John as Backup:**  I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $85 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I am confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired $100, but still lower than my previous offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while keeping in mind my own profit goals.
* **Time as a factor:** As the rounds are limited, I am weighing the potential gains of further negotiation against the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John.
* **John as backup:** John's offer of $100 remains a reliable safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $90 to make this deal work. It's still a good value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$90:**  This counteroffer is another compromise, lowering my price slightly from the previous round but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraint but emphasizing the value proposition of the product while proposing a compromise. 

**Strategy:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is my final attempt to reach a deal with Bob. If he rejects, I'm prepared to move on to John.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only five rounds remaining, I need to push for a resolution.
* **John as Backup:**  John's offer of $100 provides a safety net. I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $82 is simply not enough. I've already compromised significantly, and with only four rounds left, the risk of not reaching a mutually acceptable price is too high.  John's offer of $100 provides a guaranteed profit and minimizes the risk of losing out on a sale entirely.

**Strategy:**

* **Time Pressure:** With limited rounds remaining, the possibility of reaching a satisfactory price with Bob is diminishing.
* **Profit Maximization:**  While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, John's offer guarantees my minimum profit and allows me to close the deal.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation and the risk of walking away with nothing."
