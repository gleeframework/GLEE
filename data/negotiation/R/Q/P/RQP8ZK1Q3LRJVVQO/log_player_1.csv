This offer starts high, at $15,000, but leaves room for negotiation. This approach allows for potential for a higher sale price while also leaving room to make concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $10000? That's the highest I can go right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. That's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $13000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11500.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher with a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,500 just isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,250.  That's a fair compromise that I think we can both agree on. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12250}

Bob's final offer of $11,750 is still below my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to go any lower, so I'll sell the product to John for $12,000. It's a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum price."
