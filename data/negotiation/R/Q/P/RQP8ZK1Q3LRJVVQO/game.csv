"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $10000? That's the highest I can go right now.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000. That's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11500.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11500 just isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12250.  That's a fair compromise that I think we can both agree on. What do you say?",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12250 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11750.  This is my final offer. ",11750.0,Bob,6,
