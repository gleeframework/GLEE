"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, though. How about $85? That's the most I can afford right now.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $90 for it, and that's my final offer.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
