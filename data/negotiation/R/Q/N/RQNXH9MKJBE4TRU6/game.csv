"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,175,000.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,212,500. This is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1212500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,212,500 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the price I was initially willing to pay for the product from John. I'm hoping we can meet on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
