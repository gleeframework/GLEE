"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

``` 

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and $120 to you.  You can get it for $100 from Alice, or for $120 from John.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows you to potentially get it for less than $100."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
Alice's offer of $95 is better than buying from John for $120.  While you might be able to get it for lower, there's no guarantee of success in further negotiations."
