Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price of $100 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $20) while also allowing you to make a significant profit above your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price Bob is likely to accept and a price that maximizes your potential earnings."
