Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll be pleased with it."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Create Urgency:** By offering a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price with John, I incentivize Bob to act quickly without knowing I have another buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, giving me a chance to potentially earn even more."
