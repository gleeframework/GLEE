"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,250. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your original offer. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
