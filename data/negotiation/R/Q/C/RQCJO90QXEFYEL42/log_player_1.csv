Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiating, $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'm willing to explore a price closer to my initial offer, but I won't go below $1,500,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum value for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,750,000. This reflects both the value of the product and the potential benefits it can bring to your business.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to counter with $1650000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm open to further negotiation to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is above my minimum value of $1,500,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial offer, accepting this deal ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations or selling to John for a lower price."
