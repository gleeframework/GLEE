"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1400000 is significantly below my minimum value for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1750000. This reflects both the value of the product and the potential benefits it can bring to your business.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to counter with $1650000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm open to further negotiation to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
