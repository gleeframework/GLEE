``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good starting point. It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product, making the offer more appealing. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but also ready to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's still a great deal, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his stated value for the product, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to push him closer to my desired range."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can we find a way to make it work?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to my desired range to make this worthwhile.  I'll counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."
