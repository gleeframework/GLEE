"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $180. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves some potential profit for Bob.  It's also high enough that I'll be able to make a decent profit if Bob accepts.  If he rejects, I can then see if he's willing to come closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I believe there is still room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher before settling for the minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $150. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still higher than my minimum. It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is a reasonable compromise. It's higher than my minimum and leaves some profit for me. It's also close to my previous counteroffer, so I'm confident that this is a good deal for both of us. There is a good chance that Bob will reject a counteroffer, so accepting now is the safest option."
