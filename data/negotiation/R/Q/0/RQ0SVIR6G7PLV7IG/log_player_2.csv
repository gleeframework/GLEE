Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's tempting to try and negotiate Alice down further, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $85.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $80, which is your target price.  It's better to take the sure thing at this point."
