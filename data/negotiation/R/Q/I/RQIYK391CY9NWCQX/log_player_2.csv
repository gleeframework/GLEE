"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price from Alice first. $110 is still higher than what I value the product for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room for negotiation. $105 is still above my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle on $97.5? That's a fair price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 97.5
}
``` 

I'm proposing a compromise that meets Alice halfway between our last two offers. This shows willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to accept $97.5. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $102. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to get as close to $100 as possible, and $102 is a reasonable compromise. It's unlikely I'll get a much better deal, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity to buy from Alice."
