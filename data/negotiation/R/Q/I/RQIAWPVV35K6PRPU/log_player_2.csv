"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and potentially secure a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
