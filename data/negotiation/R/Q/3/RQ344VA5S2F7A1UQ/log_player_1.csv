"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value and could significantly benefit your operations. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $2,000,000."", 
 ""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price point. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression that the product's value is even higher in your mind.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $2,000,000, I'm setting a high anchor. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it frames subsequent negotiations around a higher number.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer will help me gauge Bob's seriousness and understand how far apart our valuations are."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to negotiate, accepting $1,200,000 would mean a substantial loss.  I'll counter-offer in the next round to see if we can find common ground closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counter:**  My counter-offer shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of a substantial loss.  
* **Middle Ground:**  By suggesting $1,750,000, I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my target while still acknowledging Bob's initial offer.
* **Continued Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's benefits to reinforce its worth in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's unique advantages, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 now matches my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the negotiations could stall. Accepting this offer guarantees I achieve my baseline target without unnecessary risk."
