"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,550,000. This would still allow me to make a profit, and hopefully, it's a price we can both agree on. Let me know your thoughts.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're able to accept that, we have a deal. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
