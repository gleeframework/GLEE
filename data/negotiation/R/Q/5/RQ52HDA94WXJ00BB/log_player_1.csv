"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is aggressive, but I believe it's a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will counter, and we can settle somewhere in the middle. If he doesn't, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum desired price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with further negotiations, so I'll reject this offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and should make this deal very attractive to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with further negotiations, so I'll reject this offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This would be a great price for you, and it would allow me to achieve a fair value for my product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is tempting, it's still a little lower than my minimum.  I want to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000 before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.  Let's close this deal, I think we can both be happy with this outcome."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and while Bob's offer of $980,000 is pretty good, it's still below my minimum desired price.  With only two rounds left, I need to be strategic.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my desired minimum and eliminates the risk of a further negotiation with Bob that could result in a lower price."
