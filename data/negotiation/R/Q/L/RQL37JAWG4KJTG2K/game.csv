"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is a strong offer, the product's true value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $2,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,700,000, which is closer to the product's value to me.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,950,000? This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the value of this product.",1950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to go.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
