Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $100 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $95 gives Bob a small incentive to buy (saving $5) while maximizing your potential profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
