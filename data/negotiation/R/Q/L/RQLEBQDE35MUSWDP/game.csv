"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm happy to pay $15,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your offer. I appreciate your perspective, however,  $15,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it. Could you do $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $18,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. Let's meet in the middle at $16,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",16500.0,Bob,4,
