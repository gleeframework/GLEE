"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your compromise, $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway -  how about $925,000? This price is still well below your estimated value, and it allows us both to walk away with a satisfactory deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $925,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach a deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
