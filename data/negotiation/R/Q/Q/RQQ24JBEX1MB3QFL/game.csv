"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'd be interested in buying it for $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to close this deal quickly. ",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in buying your product, and I'm willing to go up to $10,600.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're close to a deal.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer and go with $10,650.  This would be a great price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with your purchase. ",10650.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting very close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price.  Would you be open to $10,600?  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal quickly.",10600.0,Bob,6,
