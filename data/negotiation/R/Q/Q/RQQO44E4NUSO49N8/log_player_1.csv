{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, my goal is to get the highest price possible. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm setting the price slightly below my guaranteed sale price to create a sense of urgency and make the offer more appealing to Bob. 
* **Value Perception:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price and potentially sway Bob's perception of its worth. 

By offering the product at $1,190,000, I have a good chance of:

* **Bob Accepting:**  He gets the product for $190,000 less than its perceived value to him.
* **Maximizing My Profit:** I earn a higher price than my guaranteed sale to John."
