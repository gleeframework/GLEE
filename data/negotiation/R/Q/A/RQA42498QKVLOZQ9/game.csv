,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $975000, Bob. I think the product's value is worth more than that, considering what you've been willing to pay in the past. I'll offer it to you for $1025000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in it.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer the product to you for $1050000.
