"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This price still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $7,750? That's a significant increase from my last offer and puts us closer to a deal.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $8,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us a chance to finally close this deal. What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your flexibility.  Would you consider $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal today.",8000.0,Bob,6,
