"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
 ""product_price"": 85
}
```

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with an offer slightly above Alice's value ($80) to leave room for negotiation but signal I'm looking for a significant discount. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message aims to keep the negotiation friendly and collaborative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're making progress, but there's still room for negotiation. Alice is coming down, indicating a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic often feels fair to both parties. It shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price well below my maximum.
* **Direct and Clear:** I'm keeping the communication straightforward to avoid any misunderstandings and hopefully speed up the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $105, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $105 is a solid price, saving me $45 compared to John's offer and representing a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  Alice using the phrase ""final offer"" suggests she's unlikely to go much lower. While it might not truly be her final offer, pushing further risks antagonizing her or reaching a stalemate. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
