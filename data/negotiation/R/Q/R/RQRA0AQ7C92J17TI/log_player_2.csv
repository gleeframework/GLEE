"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($600,000 vs. $800,000), suggesting there's room for negotiation. There's also a chance to get a better price than John's offer ($800,000). It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if a more favorable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is intriguing, but it's a bit lower than I'd hoped. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to pay $700,000. This represents a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $700,000 yet. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer you the product for $650,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $650,000 is closer to my desired price point, it's still below what I believe is a fair price given the product's value. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a more favorable deal.  I'll counter with an offer closer to $700,000 to try and bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $650,000 is closer to where I want to be, I still believe $680,000 is a more reasonable price considering the value of this product. Let's try to find common ground. This offer is a compromise on my end, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 680000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $660,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $650,000 and $680,000, so I'll offer you the product for $665,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $665,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $665,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $665,000, which is closer to my desired price range and a good deal considering John's offer of $800,000. While I could continue to negotiate, the time spent doing so could potentially lead to Alice walking away or me missing out on a good deal.  Accepting this offer is a smart move to secure the product at a reasonable price."
