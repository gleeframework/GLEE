"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for your business. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. It's worthwhile to try to negotiate further and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a bold move, but it could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still leaves room for you to profit from this purchase.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above my target price of $800,000, but it's significantly closer than her previous offers.  I'm willing to accept this offer because it's a reasonable compromise and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product altogether.  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and me being forced to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
