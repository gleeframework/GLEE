"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a much lower price. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
