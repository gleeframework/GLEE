"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($8,000) and John's offer ($8,000). There's plenty of room for negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal to Alice that she needs to come down significantly in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a much lower price. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is substantially lower than Alice's asking price, but it's a common negotiation tactic to start low. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Signaling Interest:**  While the offer is low, the message expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer is closer to your target price and keeps John's offer of $8,000 as a viable backup plan."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has come down in price, $9,000 is still higher than your ideal budget and John's offer. There's still room to negotiate and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's price while still remaining below your $8,000 maximum.  It aims to find a compromise.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By staying firm and not immediately accepting $8,000 (John's price), you signal that you're looking for the best possible deal.
* **Limited Time:**  While you haven't explicitly stated it, Alice might infer that you have other options and are willing to walk away if a suitable agreement isn't reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is holding firm at $8,200, which is only slightly better than John's offer of $8,000. At this point, the potential savings of $200 by continuing negotiations with Alice are likely outweighed by the risk of her not budging further and the time spent haggling.  It makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings and buy from John."
