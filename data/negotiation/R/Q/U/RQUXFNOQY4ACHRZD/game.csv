"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,300,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $2,300,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I'm willing to be flexible to find common ground.  Let's meet in the middle - would you consider $1,950,000?",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate Alice's willingness to negotiate. While $1,950,000 is still beyond my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I hope this might be closer to what Alice is willing to accept while also staying within my financial limits.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  How about we settle this right now at $1,800,000?  This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to see this deal done.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my position. I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,800,000 is still out of my reach. I would like to make one final counteroffer of $1,650,000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually acceptable price.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
