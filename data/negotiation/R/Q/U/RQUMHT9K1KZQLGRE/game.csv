"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I'm afraid $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8,250. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $7,800 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $8,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob! I'm willing to make one more attempt to find common ground. I'm counteroffering at $8,100. This is my absolute limit, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product and meet me at this price.",8100.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $8,100, so I'm going to make a new offer. I'm willing to throw in some extras, like a free maintenance package and a warranty extension, which will add significant value to the product. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $8,100, but I think these extras make it a much more compelling deal. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,9,
