Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price for my product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $11,200.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John."
