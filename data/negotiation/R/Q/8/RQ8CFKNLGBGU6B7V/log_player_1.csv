{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $11,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be a great asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $12,000 guaranteed, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,000 is a strong starting point:
    * It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($8,000).
    * It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
    * It's still lower than what John is willing to pay, ensuring a profit.

**Important Note:** This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. Depending on his response, I can adjust my approach in further negotiations."
