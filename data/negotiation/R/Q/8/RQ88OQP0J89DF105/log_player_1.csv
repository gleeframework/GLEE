"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000).
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, emphasizing potential value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and potential counteroffers. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest while maximizing my initial profit. I'm also leaving room to adjust my price based on Bob's response and potentially reach a deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can't afford $12000 right now. Would you consider lowering the price to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob acknowledged the value of the product.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a good price, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm reiterating that I believe the product is valuable for him and that this price is fair.
* **Focus on Win-Win:** I'm framing the offer as beneficial for both of us, fostering a more collaborative negotiation.

By counteroffering at $11,000, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on. I'm still aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
