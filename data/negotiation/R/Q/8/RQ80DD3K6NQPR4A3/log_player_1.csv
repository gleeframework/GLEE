Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate, given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept anything below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm countering with $16,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $14,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can't get a better offer from him.  It's also better than selling to John for $15,000. I'll accept Bob's offer."
