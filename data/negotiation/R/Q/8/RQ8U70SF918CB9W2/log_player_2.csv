Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I think that's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500. It's a good compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```
At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000. You're better off taking John's offer to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at your target price.
