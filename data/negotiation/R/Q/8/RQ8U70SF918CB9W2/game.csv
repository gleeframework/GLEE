"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,500 for it. What do you think?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I think that's a fair offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500. It's a good compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
