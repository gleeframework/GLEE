Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm expressing optimism that Bob will find the product valuable, which could make him more open to negotiation.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, making the process feel less confrontational. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I can always fall back on John's offer if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  While $12,000 is less than my initial ask, it's still a good price.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe there's room for negotiation, and I can likely get closer to my target price with a counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John is safe, I'm willing to take the risk of potentially getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer!  I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is tempting, I'd need to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $13,500?  That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing a ""good compromise"" rather than focusing on the reduction, making it seem more agreeable.
* **Still above minimum:** This price is still well above my minimum of $10,000, so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Continued negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion by inviting Bob to respond."
