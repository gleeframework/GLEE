Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to a higher final price.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed $12,000 sale with John, so there's a safety net.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
