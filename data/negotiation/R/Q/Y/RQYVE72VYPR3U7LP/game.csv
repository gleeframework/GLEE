"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could consider a price closer to $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer you the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm eager to come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
