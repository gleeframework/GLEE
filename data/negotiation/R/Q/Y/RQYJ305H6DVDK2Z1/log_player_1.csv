"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $18,000. This is a bold opening move that aims to establish a high initial value in Bob's mind. It's crucial to keep in mind that I have a safety net with John's offer of $12,000, so there's no risk in aiming high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I'll proceed to the next round and try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $15,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and encourage Bob to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm happy to accept this offer.  I don't want to risk losing a sale and ending up with John's offer of $12,000. It's time to close the deal!"
