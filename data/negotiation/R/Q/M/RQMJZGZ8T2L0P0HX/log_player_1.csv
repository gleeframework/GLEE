{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product for $100. This is a price that's still above Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum price.  It gives Bob some room to negotiate and makes it more likely he'll accept the offer.  If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While it's a good deal, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $92.50 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go to $88. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $100.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $88 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 90}
