"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal compared to her asking price, you can likely do better.  You have a backup option with John who will sell it for $80, so you have room to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are aiming for a price closer to $80, and while $92.5 is better than her initial offer, you can likely negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $92.50 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go to $88.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $88 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy from John. At this point, you've negotiated with Alice for a while, and while $90 is better than her initial offer, it's still higher than what you're comfortable spending. You have a reliable alternative with John, who will sell you the product for $80. It's best to avoid further negotiation with Alice and go with the more secure option."
