"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While it's a good deal, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $92.50 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go to $88. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $88 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward.",90.0,Alice,5,
