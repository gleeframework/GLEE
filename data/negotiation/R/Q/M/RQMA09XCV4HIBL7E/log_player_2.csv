# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair price, taking into account your budget and the product's worth to you. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can meet in the middle.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering above my maximum budget. While I do want this product, I'm not willing to pay above $1,500,000. I will continue to negotiate, but I'll keep John as my backup option if this deal doesn't work out."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm offering it to you for $1,212,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my own needs. I hope we can finally find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,212,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,212,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,212,500 is still slightly above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. While I'm close to a deal with Alice, it's getting late in the negotiations.  I've made several counteroffers and I'm not sure she'll budge any further. To avoid risking missing out on the product altogether, I'll buy from John for $1,500,000. It's not ideal, but it guarantees I get the product and doesn't leave me stuck in a potentially endless negotiation."
