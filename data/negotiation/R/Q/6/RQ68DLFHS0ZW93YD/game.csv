"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my financial limits. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is far greater than your initial offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This is a significant price adjustment, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This demonstrates my continued interest in the product while staying within my financial limits. Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
