"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting price:** I want to maximize my potential profit, so I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired outcome.
* **Acknowledging Bob's value:** I'm mentioning that I know the product is valuable to him, building a foundation for negotiation.
* **Open to discussion:** I end with a friendly question to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation.

This strategy aims to set a strong initial position while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I have 10 rounds and can still make counteroffers to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoiding a quick sale:** Selling to John immediately would secure $800,000, but I believe I can potentially get a better deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and open the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $950,000 is tempting, I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:**  I emphasize that my counteroffer allows for a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Staying firm on value:**  While compromising, I haven't dropped below my minimum acceptable price, maintaining my position. 

This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still holding a firm stance on the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $1,000,000. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is at my minimum acceptable price. This means I'm guaranteed to make at least my desired profit.
* **Negotiation progress:**  We have successfully negotiated a price that is acceptable to both parties. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that his next counteroffer will be lower.

Accepting Bob's offer secures my desired profit and avoids the potential downsides of further negotiation."
