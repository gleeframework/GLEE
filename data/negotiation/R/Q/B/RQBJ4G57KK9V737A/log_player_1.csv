Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth at least $100. Would you be interested in buying it for $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it:

* **Reflects your minimum value:** $90 is still above your minimum of $100.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space to lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Shows you're willing to compromise:**  It's not an aggressive starting point, making it more likely Bob will engage. 

We'll see how Bob reacts and adjust our strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm currently looking to stay within my budget. Could you consider selling it for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $100.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. Would you be interested in $88?"", ""product_price"": 88}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Keeps the negotiation alive:** It keeps the door open for a deal while still protecting my minimum value. 
* **Is reasonable:**  $88 is a fair compromise, giving Bob a better price than before, but also allowing me to make a profit."
