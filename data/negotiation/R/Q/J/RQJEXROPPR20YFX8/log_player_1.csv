I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate.  I believe this initial offer is high enough to pique Bob's interest while leaving room for potential concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not going to accept it immediately. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

Bob's offer is $1,250,000. This is above my minimum of $1,200,000 and is a decent amount higher than John's offer. I'll accept this offer and sell the product to Bob."
