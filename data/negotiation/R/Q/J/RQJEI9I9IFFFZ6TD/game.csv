,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $8200. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm still not willing to go all the way down to $8000, but I'm willing to meet you a bit closer to your target. How about we try $8400?",8400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $8400 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8200, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8200.0,Bob,6,
