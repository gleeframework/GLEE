Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment for you."", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to your ideal outcome.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial high offer will help gauge Bob's seriousness and give you an idea of his perception of the product's value. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, which gives you a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you given its value to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate, and rejecting this offer signals that you're serious about getting a better deal. You'll aim for a counteroffer closer to $1,700,000 - $1,800,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. This product has significant potential and I'm confident it can generate considerable value for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):** By coming down to $1,750,000, you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong price. 
* **Highlight Value:** Re-emphasize the product's value to Bob. This keeps the focus on the potential benefits for him, justifying a higher price.
* **""Meeting in the Middle""**:  Framing the counteroffer as a compromise can encourage Bob to feel like he's getting a fair deal and incentivize him to move closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the potential of the product while staying within my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially push for a slightly higher price in another round of negotiation, there's a risk that Bob might walk away.  It's a good business decision to accept this offer and secure a profitable deal."
