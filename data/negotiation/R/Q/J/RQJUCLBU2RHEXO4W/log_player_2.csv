This product has significant potential and I'm confident it can generate considerable value for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still too high for my budget. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can come to an agreement."
