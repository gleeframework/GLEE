{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts at a relatively high price, leaving room for negotiation.  It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I think that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is at your minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I will counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our potential for a long-term relationship.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $8,250. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my minimum.  While I would prefer more,  it's a better deal than selling to John for $8,000.  I'm accepting the offer to secure the sale."
