"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and what John is offering. You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if I can get it closer to my budget.  Would you consider $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiating practice to start with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Significantly Below Alice's Offer:**  By offering $80, you're signaling that $150 was far too high. 
* **Above John's Price:** While you have the option to buy from John for $100,  starting negotiations at $80 gives you a chance to get an even better deal.
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed positively, expressing continued interest while clearly stating your budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While $110 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you want to spend, especially knowing you can get it for $100 from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving down from $150 to $110. This suggests there's potential to get the price lower. 
* **Leverage of John's Offer:** You can use the fact that you have another offer for $100 as leverage in the next round of negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $110 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I could do $90, and I think that's a fair offer.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** Increasing your offer from $80 to $90 shows Alice that you're willing to negotiate and move closer to her price point.
* **Still Below Budget:** $90 keeps you well within your budget and leaves room for a potential final compromise without exceeding $100.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating that you think $90 is a fair offer, you subtly introduce a sense of urgency for Alice to accept before you potentially walk away and choose John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're really interested in this product, Bob! I can see you're willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is now only $5 away from John's price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Not Worth the Risk:** While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go down to $100.  It's not worth the risk of her refusing and sticking to $105.
* **John's Offer is Solid:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $100 from John. This meets your budget and saves you the hassle of further negotiation."
