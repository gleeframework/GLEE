"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if I can get it closer to my budget.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $110 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I could do $90, and I think that's a fair offer.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think you're really interested in this product, Bob! I can see you're willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
