"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  While I can't disclose specifics just yet, it's worth at least $10000 to me.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I believe it will be mutually beneficial.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $12,000. While she claims the product is worth at least $10,000 to her, that information is irrelevant to your decision. You know you can get the same product from John for a lower price."
