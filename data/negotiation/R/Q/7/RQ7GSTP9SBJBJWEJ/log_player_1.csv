Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $150, we want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to our valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your minimum ($150) leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing on a price higher than $150. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  A high initial offer helps gauge how interested Bob is. If he immediately rejects it, we can always go to John."
