"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and your appreciation for it, I propose a starting price of $11000. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering the significant benefits this product can bring to your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** Bob's maximum budget is $12,000, and Alice is asking for $11,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation, as Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000 and Alice's value is $10,000. 
* **No need to rush:** Bob has 10 rounds, so there's no urgency to accept the first offer. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of our product and your interest, I am willing to negotiate at $10750. This price still reflects the high quality and value of the product while accommodating your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's value:**  Alice is now offering $10,750, which is closer to Bob's maximum of $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could counteroffer again, the potential for saving more money is limited. 
* **Time is a factor:**  As the rounds progress, the risk of not reaching an agreement increases. 

Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price,  leaving some room for potential profit if he resells it."
