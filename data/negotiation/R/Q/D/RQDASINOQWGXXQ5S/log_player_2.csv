{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $100. This is a strong opening offer, making it clear that I'm serious about buying the product but won't go higher.  I'm hoping Alice will see the value in closing the deal rather than risking losing the sale entirely."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. Although it's getting closer, I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price. I'm also considering the value of the product to Alice, which is $150.  I believe there's still room for a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only to $120. I'm trying to find a middle ground between Alice's offer and my budget. I'm hoping that this offer will be enticing enough for Alice to accept, as she's only making a $20 profit at this price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget of $100.  However, it's getting closer.  With only a few rounds left, I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can reach a price I'm comfortable with. I'm also keeping in mind that John is always an option if we can't reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $125, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $120 and Alice's offer of $130. I'm hoping this shows Alice that I'm serious about reaching a compromise and that we're close to a deal. With only two rounds left, I need to find a price that both of us can agree on."
