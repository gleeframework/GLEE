"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $10,500?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll come down to $10,000. That's my final offer. If you're not able to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, $9,000 is as low as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make a decision soon. Can you meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,6,
