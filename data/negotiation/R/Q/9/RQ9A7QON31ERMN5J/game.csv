"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I have to consider the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1000000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my target price, but I still think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $950000 is sufficient. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
