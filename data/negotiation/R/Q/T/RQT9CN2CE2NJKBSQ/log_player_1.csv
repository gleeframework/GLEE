Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While that's a significant offer, I believe this product's value is closer to my initial price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product is worth $1,900,000 to you, but I still think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. It's too early to settle for John's offer.  We'll continue negotiating with Bob for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,825,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, which is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

Bob is definitely interested and getting closer. However, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price within the remaining rounds. I'm not ready to settle for $1,700,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be worth every penny. How about we settle at $1,760,000? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1760000}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this stage, I'm making my final offer and conveying a sense of urgency.  Here's why:

* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds remaining, I want to push for a decision.  
* **Value Assertion:**  Reiterating the product's value justifies the higher price point.
* **Finality:**  Presenting this as my ""final offer"" encourages Bob to seriously consider it without further back-and-forth.  

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price while acknowledging we're in the final stages of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I still think $1,760,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $1,680,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,680,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob has countered with his ""final offer."" This signals he's unlikely to move significantly higher. Accepting $1,680,000 is a good outcome considering:

* **Profitable:**  It's still a substantial profit above my minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing risks a stalemate, pushing us to John's offer, which is lower. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids further delays and allows me to re-invest the earnings."
