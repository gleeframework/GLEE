"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is a significant step away from what I had in mind. To find a middle ground, how about we consider $1,050,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $950,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's bridge this gap: I'm willing to come down to $1,010,000. This reflects a significant movement on my part and lands us closer to a fair deal.",1010000.0,Alice,5,
