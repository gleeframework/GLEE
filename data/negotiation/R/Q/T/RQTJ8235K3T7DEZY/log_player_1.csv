"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming to maximize profit, so starting with a strong offer ($1,100,000) close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) is strategic. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial price gives us room to negotiate down while still staying well above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Polite and Professional Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone is crucial for building rapport and encouraging a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant profit, it's substantially lower than both our initial offer and Bob's perceived value. Rejecting shows we're willing to negotiate but not at any cost, encouraging him to move closer to our desired range. We're still early in the negotiation, so the risk of losing the deal to John is relatively low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is a significant step away from what I had in mind. To find a middle ground, how about we consider $1,050,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($900,000) and our previous price ($1,100,000) but leans slightly in our favor. 
* **Justification:** We're providing a reason for our counteroffer (""fair deal for both of us"") to make it more palatable.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** We're still using a collaborative and understanding tone to encourage continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $950,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial offer. While $950,000 is tempting, we're still six rounds away from our guaranteed sale to John. We have room to push for a better price without jeopardizing the deal too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's bridge this gap: I'm willing to come down to $1,010,000. This reflects a significant movement on my part and lands us closer to a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 1010000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller concession this round ($40,000) compared to the previous round ($100,000), signaling that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Highlighting Our Movement:** We're emphasizing our willingness to negotiate by explicitly stating we've made a ""significant movement.""
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  Continuing to frame the negotiation around a ""fair deal"" reinforces that we value a win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,010,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $990,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $990,000 is a significant profit margin, well above our minimum acceptable price and a good return on the negotiation.
* **Negotiation Pattern:** Bob has consistently increased his offer in $40,000-$50,000 increments. It's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer beyond this point.
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, closing the deal now provides certainty and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling."
