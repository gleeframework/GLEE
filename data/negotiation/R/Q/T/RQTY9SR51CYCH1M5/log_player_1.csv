Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly what John is offering, and it's my minimum acceptable price.  However, I've already had multiple rounds of negotiation with Bob and haven't been able to get him to budge. I'm also not sure if I can make a better offer to him that he will accept.  It's better to just sell to John now and be done with it."
