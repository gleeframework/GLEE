"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for both of us. This unique item is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I believe it would significantly contribute to your endeavors or personal ambitions. After careful consideration, I am proposing to sell this product to you for $1,200,000. This offer represents a significant discount compared to its true worth, aiming to ensure that we both benefit from this transaction.

Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. I am eager to facilitate this sale and bring this valuable asset into your possession.

Warm regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly inflating the value of the product to you. You know your maximum price is $1,500,000, but there's no guarantee the product is actually worth that much.
* Her offer, while seemingly generous, is still significantly higher than what it's worth to her ($800,000). 
* By rejecting her offer, you force her hand. She wants to sell, and you're a potential buyer.  She'll likely come back with a lower offer.
* Your alternative is buying from John at $1,500,000.  While that's your maximum, it's better to see if Alice will drop her price first."
