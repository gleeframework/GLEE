Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 10000} 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000), but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate.  This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still leaving room for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, you can still try to get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially get closer to your target price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still aiming for a price closer to your desired $10,000.  It shows you are willing to negotiate but are still trying to get a better price."
