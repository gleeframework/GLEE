"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a way to make this work.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $130 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to pay $110, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,5,
