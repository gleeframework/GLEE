"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to us, we're considering a price of $14,000 for it. We understand its worth to you might be around $12,000, but we hope this price will be acceptable for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. While her message acknowledges my potential valuation, I have room to negotiate. It's worth seeing if I can get closer to my target price before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $14,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000. It's a fair price that considers its worth to me."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is getting closer to my range, but I'm still $500 away from my ideal price. I'll try to meet her halfway and see if she's willing to compromise further."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250? That seems like a fair compromise for both of us."",
