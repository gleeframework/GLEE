I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a starting point, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  However, if he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to consider his counteroffer or walk away and sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer, but it's still not enough for me.  I'm going to go ahead and sell to John for $8,000. It's a guaranteed deal and it's closer to my desired price than Bob's offer."
