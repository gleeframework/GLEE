"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is below my initial asking price, I recognize your perspective on its value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
