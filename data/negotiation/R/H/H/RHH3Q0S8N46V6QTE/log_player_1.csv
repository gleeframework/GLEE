Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. My price is $130, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn a higher profit.  I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, which could make Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $110 for the product right now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While I understand your position, $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. This would still allow me to make a fair profit and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
