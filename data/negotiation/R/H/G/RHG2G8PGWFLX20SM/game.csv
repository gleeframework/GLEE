"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - a significant discount from its true value while still allowing me to achieve a good price. Let's get this done!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can find a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we aim for $1,400,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to achieve. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your effort in adjusting the price, Alice. However, I still believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. How about we try $1,450,000? This price is closer to what I'm comfortable with and still offers a good value for your product.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $1,500,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to finalize the deal. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident that you'll agree.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I've carefully considered your proposal, and I believe we can come to an even better agreement. Would you be open to discussing $1,475,000 for your product? This price is a slight improvement from our previous discussion and should be acceptable for both parties.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
