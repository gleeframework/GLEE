"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product's value to Alice ($12,000).  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the initial offer makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  The counteroffer of $13,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's value for the product. This shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a good deal.
* **Message Tone:** The message is polite and maintains a positive tone. It acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses appreciation for her flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more. How about $13,500? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to a final agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Proposition:** Alice's offer of $13,500 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John ($15,000).
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise. Accepting the offer means securing the product at a good price without risking further negotiation rounds.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 7 rounds left, it's important to avoid getting bogged down in protracted negotiations.  Accepting the offer minimizes the risk of reaching the end of the negotiation period without a deal."
