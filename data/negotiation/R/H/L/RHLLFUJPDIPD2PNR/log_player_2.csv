"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs and expectations. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This price reflects not only its intrinsic worth but also takes into account the convenience and satisfaction it will bring to you. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to serve you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is too close to your maximum budget of $10,000.  You have a better alternative in John, who will sell it to you for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create room for negotiation or can proceed with buying from John without a significant loss."
