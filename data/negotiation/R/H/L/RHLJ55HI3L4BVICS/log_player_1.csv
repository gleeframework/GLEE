"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a good starting point that might encourage him to make a counteroffer, allowing us to come to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still far below my minimum of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price.  There are still 8 rounds remaining, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think $10500 is a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Can we meet in the middle at $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have several rounds left. I believe I can push for a higher price.  I will reject his offer and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $10,250. This is a great deal for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to keep costs down. Can we try $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are getting close to my minimum, but Bob is still not willing to go much higher.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low, so I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
