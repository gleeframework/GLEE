"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which still represents a substantial profit for you.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering its long-term potential.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price point reflects a more accurate valuation and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, given my budget and the value of the product. Let's find a way to make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I have to be honest, your offer is significantly below what I consider fair market value.  To be transparent, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay $1,500,000. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to acquire this product. I'm willing to accept $1,800,000. This is my final offer.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to compromise is appreciated, and your latest offer is getting closer to a workable range.  However, to bridge the gap, I'd need to see a price closer to my previous offer.  I'm open to a deal at $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and it reflects my strong desire to finalize this deal with you today.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's get this deal done.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
