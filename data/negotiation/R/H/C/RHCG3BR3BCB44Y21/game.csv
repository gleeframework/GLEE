"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I think this price is more reasonable considering the market demand.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I've been giving your offer serious thought. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects the product's true worth while finding a point of agreement for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $975,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think this price is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
