Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it presents significant value, and this is a competitive offer."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Since Bob values the product at $12,000, there's room to negotiate above that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  It's important that the offered price is still significantly appealing compared to John's guaranteed $15,000 offer. 

This strategy aims to secure a sale price significantly higher than Bob's valuation while remaining attractive enough to avoid him rejecting the offer."
