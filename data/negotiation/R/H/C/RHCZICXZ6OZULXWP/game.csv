"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $750,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I've placed on the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This price is fair considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer of $800,000 and my previous offer of $900,000.
