"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $1100000 for it? This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've offered. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is my best counteroffer so far, and I'm confident it's a great value for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $1150000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm happy to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1150000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1300000, so I'm offering the product to you for $1200000. This is my best offer so far, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
