Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149.  I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, while still securing a profit above your minimum.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** Since you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, you have leverage. There's no pressure to go below your minimum. 

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might outright reject $149. However, this strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit from Bob while still ensuring a sale at your desired price point."
