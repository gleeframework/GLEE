"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($120 < $150).** 
* **You save money by accepting Alice's offer compared to buying from John ($150).** 
* **While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will lower the price, and you risk losing the product.**"
