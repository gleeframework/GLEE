"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? I believe this would still provide a good value for the product.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $105? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.",105.0,Alice,3,
