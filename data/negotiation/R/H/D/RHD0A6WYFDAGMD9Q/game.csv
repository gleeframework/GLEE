"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hey Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $14,000 to make it worth my while. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my absolute maximum. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $13,500? It's a bit higher than your maximum, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're running out of patience, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a free maintenance package. How about we meet at $13,500 and I'll add these extras?",13500.0,Alice,7,
