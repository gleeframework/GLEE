"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you consider this offer?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $13000, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",13250.0,Alice,5,
