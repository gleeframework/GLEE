"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and your offer.  I understand your perspective, but the value of this product to me is quite high.  I'd be willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe that's a fair reflection of its potential.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,650,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.  While $1,650,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept that price at this time.  My final offer is $1,700,000. This represents a significant reduction on my initial asking price and reflects my desire to see this product in the hands of someone who recognizes its potential.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,700,000. I'm willing to make one more offer: $1,600,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this final offer?",1600000.0,Bob,6,
