"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is too high for Bob. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he knows he can get the product for $800,000 from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, as that's the highest I can go at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is significantly higher than $850,000. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target.  He's willing to pay $850,000, and he knows he can get it for $800,000 from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $975,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price significantly, it's still above Bob's target of $900,000.  Bob is still willing to pay more than John's price, so there's room for further negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, hoping to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  your price is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $950,000. I believe this is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's counteroffer of $925,000. While there's a chance Alice might budge further, it's risky to continue.  Given that Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000, it's the most logical choice. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks ending up with a higher price than John's offer.  Therefore, it's time to secure the product from John and avoid further uncertainty."
