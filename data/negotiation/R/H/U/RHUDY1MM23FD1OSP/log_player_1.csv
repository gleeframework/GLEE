Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price reflects a significant savings for me while still offering you a fair return on your investment.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This price is a fair compromise, and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

While I could push for a bit more, $1,075,000 is a solid profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further extended negotiations."
