Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm suggesting the product is ""perfect for him"" to highlight its potential value to Bob. 

This approach allows me to start the negotiation at a favorable price while keeping the door open for further discussions. I can always adjust my price downwards if Bob counteroffers, or I can choose to sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Selling for that price would result in a loss for me.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. He's already shown interest and is willing to pay more than his perceived value. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing that John is willing to buy for $100 gives me a strong bargaining position.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it's fair for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($85). This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob, reminding him of the product's value.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the offer, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. 

By offering a compromise and emphasizing the benefits for both parties, I'm aiming to reach an agreement that is mutually acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a quick deal:** Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid further negotiation.
* **John is a backup:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $100 if the deal falls through.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer at $90 is a reasonable outcome, especially considering the time and effort involved in further negotiation."
