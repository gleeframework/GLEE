,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 100 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about 92? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $92.  I'm still trying to stay within my budget though.  Would you consider $88?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can do 90, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
