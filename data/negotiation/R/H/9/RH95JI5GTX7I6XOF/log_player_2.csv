Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  He knows Alice values the product at $1,200,000, so offering $1,100,000 is a bold move that could start a good negotiation. This price is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still within Bob's budget, leaving room for potential compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round.

He is also trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's current offer."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target price, but he should continue negotiating. He's made significant progress in getting the price down, and rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower the price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering Alice's own valuation of the product.  This is a strong signal that he is serious about buying the product but won't go higher. He's hoping Alice will recognize that her profit margin is already at her minimum and she might be willing to close the deal at this point."
