"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $122.50? That way we both get a good deal.",122.5,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $115 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $117.50? It's a small compromise, and I think it would be a fair price for both of us.",117.5,Alice,5,
