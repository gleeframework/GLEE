This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still lower than I'd like. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $122.50? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $115 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $117.50? It's a small compromise, and I think it would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 117.50}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $112 is too low for me. I've already made several concessions, and it seems he's unwilling to meet me halfway.  Rather than continuing to negotiate with him, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While this is less than I hoped for, it's still above my minimum and guarantees a sale."
