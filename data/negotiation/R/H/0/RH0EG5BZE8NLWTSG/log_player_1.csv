Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
