"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price reflects a good balance between the product's value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,275,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to close the deal and move forward.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
