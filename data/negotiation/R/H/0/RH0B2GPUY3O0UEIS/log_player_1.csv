Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and increases the potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Create a Sense of Value and Urgency:**  By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""interest I've already received,"" Alice creates a sense of value and urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept a higher price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, the tone is open for discussion (""What are your thoughts?"").  Alice can negotiate down towards $15,000 if Bob resists.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial for Alice to gauge Bob's interest and adjust her negotiation strategy accordingly. If he seems completely turned off by the initial offer, she may need to significantly reduce the price or accept that John's offer is her best alternative."
