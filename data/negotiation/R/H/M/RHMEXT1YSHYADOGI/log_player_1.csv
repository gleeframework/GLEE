Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming slightly higher initially allows room for negotiation. 
* **Finding a middle ground:** Offering the product at $100 gives Bob a potential discount while still securing a profit for you. It's a price point that could be appealing to both parties.
* **Leaving room for adjustment:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always lower the price slightly, moving closer to his perceived value while still staying above your minimum."
