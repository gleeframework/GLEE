"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,200,000), it's still lower than what you would pay John ($1,500,000). Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000."
