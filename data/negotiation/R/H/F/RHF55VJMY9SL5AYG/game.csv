"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $10,500. How about $9,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $9,800 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  How about $10,200?  This is a good compromise that reflects the value of the product while still being within your budget. Let's try to close this deal!",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit far from $10,200. How about $9,900? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to get as close to my budget as possible.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence.  To be honest, $9,900 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $10,000?  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,7,
