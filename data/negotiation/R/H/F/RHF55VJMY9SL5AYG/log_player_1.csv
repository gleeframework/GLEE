{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price that's slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Balancing Act:** I want to maximize my profits, but also encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. A significantly higher price might scare him away.
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not overly pressured to accept a low offer from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would mean losing a substantial amount of profit.
* **Negotiation:** I still have room to negotiate with Bob. I'm willing to entertain a counteroffer, but I'll try to push for a price closer to my ideal.
* **Backup Plan:**  It's important to remember that I have John, who's willing to pay my minimum. This gives me leverage and allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price between $10,000 and $11,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** My counter offer aims to find a middle ground. It's higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility while still prioritizing my desired profit margin.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's interest and try to build rapport by expressing willingness to compromise. I also highlight the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing that my offer still presents a good deal for him.
* **Backup Plan:** The knowledge of John's offer allows me to be more firm in my counteroffer, as I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I secure a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next offer and decide if I want to counter or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  Accepting would mean leaving a substantial amount of potential profit on the table.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I want to push for a higher price. There's still room for a compromise, and I can likely get closer to my target price.
* **Backup Plan:**  The fact that I have John as a backup buyer gives me confidence to reject Bob's offer. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I'm willing to walk away if I can't reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price between $10,000 and $10,500. My goal is to find a price that's fair for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $9,800 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  How about $10,200?

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's try to close this deal"" adds a sense of urgency, subtly suggesting that I'm ready to move forward, but also open to a final compromise.
