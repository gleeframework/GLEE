"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. This is a fair price considering its unique value and potential. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $2000000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product, but I'm sure we can find a middle ground. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1500000 is simply not a fair price for this product.  It's a unique opportunity with significant potential value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1750000?  This leaves some room for negotiation but also reflects the product's true worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1600000?  I believe this price is fair considering our ongoing discussions and my budget constraints.  Let's try to reach a final agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  $1600000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not quite there.  To bridge the gap, how about $1650000? This reflects the value of the product and acknowledges your financial constraints. It's a fair compromise that allows us to finalize this deal.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  However, $1650000 is still a bit above my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $1625000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement. It's a reasonable price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1625000.0,Bob,6,
