This offer starts high, but is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, $125 is significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. That's still a good price for a product of this quality, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $140 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll make one last counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal. If Bob rejects it, I'll sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $130 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we settle at $135? That's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}

Bob's offer:

You have three options:

This is getting tedious. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm starting to lose patience. I've already made several concessions and I'm not convinced he'll go any higher.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
