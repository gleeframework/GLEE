You can still get the product for a lower price than $850,000. It is worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you and the value I place on it.

Alice's offer of $825,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than the $850,000 she offered before, and it's significantly lower than the $1,200,000 he would pay John.  At this point, it's a good idea to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation."
