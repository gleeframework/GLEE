"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850000. I believe this price still reflects its value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $850000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $750000.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product. This represents a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will be a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go below $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000.
