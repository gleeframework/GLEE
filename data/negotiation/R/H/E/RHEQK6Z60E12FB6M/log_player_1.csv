``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal (as it's still below his value of $1,000,000), while also allowing you to potentially get a better price than John's offer. This strategy is meant to encourage negotiation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1250000 is a bit above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1050000 at this time. It's a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a higher price, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to make this deal happen. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential gains. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1150000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1100000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
