Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product. I believe it's incredibly valuable, and I'm asking for $18,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both my minimum price and Bob's valuation. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing my own minimum price. This justifies the high initial offer.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, I'm setting an ""anchor"" for the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects the offer, his counteroffer is likely to be closer to my initial price than if I had started lower.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while leaving myself room to negotiate down towards a price that is still very profitable for me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if Bob's counteroffers are too low, as I have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below both my asking price and his own stated valuation of the product. This suggests he's trying to negotiate a bargain, which is understandable. However, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer when I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and propose a counteroffer that is still above my minimum but shows a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $8,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's find a middle ground - how about we agree on $14,000?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Reduced Price:**  I've dropped the price by $4,000 from my initial offer, signaling flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps the price well above both my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value of the product.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** My message emphasizes finding a compromise, encouraging Bob to engage in a more realistic price discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss $11,000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price and represents a reasonable profit. While I could try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob might walk away if I push too hard. 

**Outcome:**

It's better to secure a sure $1,000 profit than risk losing the sale altogether. I'll accept Bob's offer."
