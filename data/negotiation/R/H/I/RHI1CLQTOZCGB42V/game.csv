"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Alice,3,
