It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation."

Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is still slightly higher than your maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."
