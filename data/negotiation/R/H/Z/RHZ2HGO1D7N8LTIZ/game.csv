"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  It's still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to make a good profit.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
