"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130.  What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $85 right now. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $110. That gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle at $102.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $98.75. Let's finalize this deal and get this product in my hands!",98.75,Bob,6,
