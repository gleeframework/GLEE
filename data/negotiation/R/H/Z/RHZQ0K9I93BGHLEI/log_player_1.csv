"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,350,000? This still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close the deal quickly.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. $1,300,000 is a good price and we're getting close to the end of the negotiations. It's better than selling to John for $1,200,000."
