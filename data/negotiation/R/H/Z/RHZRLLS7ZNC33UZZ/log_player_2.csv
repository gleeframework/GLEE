{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth paying $120 for a product you value at $100.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering $90 for the product. This is a fair price considering I value it at $100 and you are also willing to sell it for $100."

While Alice's offer is closer to my value, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."

I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise, as it's closer to her price and still within my budget."

Alice is getting closer to my price, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's better to buy the product from John for $100, as that's the best deal available now."
