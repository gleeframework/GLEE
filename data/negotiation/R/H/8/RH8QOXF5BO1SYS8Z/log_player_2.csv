"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You have a lot of room to counteroffer before having to resort to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your absolute maximum price. It's a bold move, but it sets a clear boundary and shows Alice you are serious about negotiating.  If she rejects this, you know she's not interested in selling at a reasonable price, and you can move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,700,000 is still a significant amount, it's closer to your desired range. However, there's still room for negotiation, and there's no guarantee that Alice won't come down further. Rejecting this offer allows for continued negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's significantly higher than your initial offer, showing willingness to meet Alice halfway.  At the same time, it leaves some room for further negotiation if Alice is willing to come down further. It's a calculated risk, but it positions you for a potentially successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,650,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still a significant amount. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and you've shown a willingness to meet her halfway.  Rejecting this offer and counteroffering again will continue to put pressure on Alice and could potentially lead to a deal closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and she's coming down in price.  This counteroffer is a significant jump from your last offer, but it's still well within your budget and leaves room for a possible agreement. If Alice rejects this, you're likely going to have to accept her next offer or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your desired price. You've already made several counteroffers and shown a willingness to negotiate, but Alice hasn't come down enough.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will not result in a price you're comfortable with.  To avoid further delays and ensure you acquire the product within your budget, it's best to accept John's offer of $1,000,000."
