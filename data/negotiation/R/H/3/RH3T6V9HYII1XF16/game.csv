"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $107.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $107.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $106? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $106 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you the product for $108. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",108.0,Alice,5,
