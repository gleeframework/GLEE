Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is closer to your maximum budget, you're still better off trying to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, and you can still get the product for a better price than John's offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $105 is the best price she's offered so far and is within your budget. It's a good deal, considering you can get the product for $120 from John.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away from the deal entirely."
