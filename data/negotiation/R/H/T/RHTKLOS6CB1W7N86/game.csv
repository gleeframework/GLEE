"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm trying to save as much as I can. Can you meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a fair price for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's make this deal happen!",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $105? It's a fair price for me, and I think we can both be happy with that.",105.0,Bob,4,
