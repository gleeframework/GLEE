# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her valuation, but still within your budget.  However, it's likely Alice is willing to negotiate lower since she's motivated to sell. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned the product has for your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than her original offer, but still below your maximum.  It appears she is willing to negotiate.  There's still room to bargain for a lower price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $1,150,000, but I'm still not sure if that's enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,300,000, so I'll offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is still higher than her valuation, but it's lower than your previous counteroffer and close to the middle ground.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in a small decrease in price, and the risk of losing the deal is increasing.  Accepting the offer secures the product for a reasonable price within your budget."
