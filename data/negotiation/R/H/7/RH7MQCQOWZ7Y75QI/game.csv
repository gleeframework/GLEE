"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $8,500.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's make this happen.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,875. That's the middle ground between our previous offers, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",8875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,875 still isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle again,  How about we settle on $9,062.50?  That's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",9062.5,Alice,5,
