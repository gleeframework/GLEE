"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $700,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This is the highest I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
