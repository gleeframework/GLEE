"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset while providing me with a fair return on my investment. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is still a significant amount of money, but it's within my budget. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to be careful with my finances.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still leaves room for you to benefit significantly. Let's find a middle ground so we can both walk away happy.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $925,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to be careful with my finances.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial situation, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $940,000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price if we keep talking.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. I hope we can come to an agreement.",915000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $915,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $927,500? This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we keep working together.",927500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $927,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",920000.0,Bob,8,
