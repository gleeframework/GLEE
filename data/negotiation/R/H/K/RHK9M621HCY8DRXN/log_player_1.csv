Round 2
Bob's offer:

We're still quite a bit away from my bottom line. Let's see if we can negotiate further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product holds significant value, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one final attempt to reach a compromise. I can offer $790,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his final offer. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on potential profit. It's wiser to take John's guaranteed $800,000 offer at this point."
