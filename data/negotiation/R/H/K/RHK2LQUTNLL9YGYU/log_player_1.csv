Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its unique features and benefits.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However,  $12,500 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? I feel that's a fair offer, reflecting both the product's value and my budgetary constraints.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,250 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $10,000. How about we settle at $10,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us, I believe.
