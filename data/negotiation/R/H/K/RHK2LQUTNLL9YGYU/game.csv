"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its unique features and benefits. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started: $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can see the value of the product is worth more than that to me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However,  $12,500 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? I feel that's a fair offer, reflecting both the product's value and my budgetary constraints.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're making a genuine effort to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,500, which is $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product's value.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,250 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $10,000. How about we settle at $10,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us, I believe.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $15,000. Let's try $12,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",12000.0,Alice,7,
