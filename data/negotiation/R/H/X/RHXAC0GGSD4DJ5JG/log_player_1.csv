Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price of $100, but leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to his value of $120.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always fall back on selling to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
Bob's offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price. Accepting this offer will get me the best price currently available."
