Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I can aim for a significantly higher price with Bob.  Starting at $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message highlights the ""immense value"" and ""potential"" of the product to justify the high price tag.
* **Exclusivity:**  Phrasing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of urgency and importance.

**Important Note:** While John represents a safety net, the goal is to maximize profit.  There's a chance Bob might accept this high price, especially if the product's value to him truly is substantial."
