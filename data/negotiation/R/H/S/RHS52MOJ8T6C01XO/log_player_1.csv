Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for a product worth so much. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable offer:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's above your minimum:**  You're still getting more than your minimum value.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects it, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his response.

Let me know if you want to explore other strategies or adjust this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm looking to get the best deal possible, and I'm not sure I can stretch to $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and counteroffer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value and my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $10,000.  This is still a great price for a product of this value, and it allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

This counteroffer does a few things:

* **It's a compromise:** It's halfway between your last offer and Bob's offer, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum value.
* **It frames the offer positively:** You're emphasizing the value of the product and the benefit of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to pay $9,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and counteroffer again.  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not high enough for me to accept.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I respect that.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800, which is a great price for the value you'll get. Let's close this deal and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

This counteroffer is a small compromise from your previous offer, but it still keeps you above your minimum value. It also frames the offer as a win-win situation for both of you.  You're showing a willingness to negotiate while also making it clear that you're not going to give away the product for much less than what it's worth to you."
