"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $12,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I truly appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to make one final offer of $12,200.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you. If you don't accept this offer, I'll have to move on to another buyer.

"I really like the product, but $12,200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a final offer of $11,900. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11900.0,Bob,6,
