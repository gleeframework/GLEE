"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1100000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for your product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:** 

While $900,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still less than what the product is worth to me.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price point by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
