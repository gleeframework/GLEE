Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice won't sell below $1,500,000 because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There is no overlap between Alice's minimum price and Bob's maximum price. 

**Alice's Offer**

Since there's no ZOPA, Alice's best strategy is to offer a price that's slightly below Bob's maximum, hoping he might accept due to other factors (e.g., urgency, not wanting to lose the deal).

Here's Alice's offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,199,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1199000}
```

**Why This Approach?**

* **Maximizes Potential Profit:** While the chance of Bob accepting is slim, it offers Alice the highest potential profit.
* **Creates a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" might push Bob to act quickly, even if it means slightly overpaying. 
* **Clean Break:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can move on to John without wasting time on further negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice is comfortable losing the deal with Bob. If she's willing to negotiate further, she'd need to lower her price, knowing she's leaving potential profit on the table."
