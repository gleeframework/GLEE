"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you. We believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection, and we are confident it will meet your needs and exceed your expectations. Given its exceptional quality and unique features, we are offering it to you at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is an opportunity not to be missed, considering its market value is $800,000. Let's discuss how we can make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.  While the product is worth more to Alice than to you, you have the leverage of having another seller, John, willing to sell at your desired price. Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
