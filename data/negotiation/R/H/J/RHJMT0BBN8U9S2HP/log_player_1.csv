This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than your minimum acceptable price, giving you room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to secure a price that works for me."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $950,000,  $920,000 is a good compromise, and it's a better deal than selling to John for $1,200,000.  It's important to recognize that Bob is likely to be more motivated to buy the product at this price point, and there's a chance further negotiation could lead to a stalemate."
