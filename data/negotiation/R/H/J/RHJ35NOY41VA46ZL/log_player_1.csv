Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering the product at $9,000, knowing it's worth more to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not setting the price too high, as that might make Bob immediately reject the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for a conversation and potential compromise.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still potential to reach a price closer to my goal by counter-offering. 
* **Avoiding a ""quick sell"":**  Selling to John for $10,000 is tempting, but I'm not in a hurry. Negotiating with Bob might lead to a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $8,500 but lower than my original $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:** $8,750 is still above my minimum price of $10,000, so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution. 

**Next steps:**

I'll be ready to adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response. If he rejects again, I might consider lowering my offer slightly more or even opting to sell to John if I feel the negotiation isn't going anywhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $8,750 is still a little high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,625.  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** $8,625 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Further negotiation is unlikely:**  Bob has been consistently lowering his offer, making it unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I'd prefer $10,000, continuing to negotiate might take too much time and could risk losing the deal entirely.

**Conclusion:**

Given the current situation, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision. I can secure a sale close to my minimum and avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a stalemate."
