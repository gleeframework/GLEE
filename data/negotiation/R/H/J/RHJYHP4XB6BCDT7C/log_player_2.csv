"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than John's price of $12,000, it's still possible to get a better deal. Since you're willing to pay up to $12,000, there's room to negotiate with Alice.  By rejecting her initial offer, you might encourage her to propose a lower price, bringing you closer to the product's actual value to her ($8,000)."
