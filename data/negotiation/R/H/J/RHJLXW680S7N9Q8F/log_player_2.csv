While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. There's room to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $700,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable range, considering my maximum budget. I'm hoping to get Alice to budge and meet me halfway."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me a chance to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $725,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping this move will encourage Alice to make a more agreeable counteroffer in the next round."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $762,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but I'm starting to see a pattern of her counteroffers being closer to my desired price point. I believe with another round of negotiation, I can secure a deal closer to my maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 740000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, this time to $740,000.  Alice has been moving closer to my price point, and I believe this counteroffer will push her to seriously consider a deal.  I'm still below my maximum budget, and this offers a good middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $755,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $755,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my maximum budget of $800,000.  While I would still prefer a lower price, the negotiation has gone on for several rounds and I'm starting to run out of time. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and running the clock down even further."
