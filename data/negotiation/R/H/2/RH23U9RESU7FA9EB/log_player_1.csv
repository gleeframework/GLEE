Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $130. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $130, which is slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  While $130 is probably too high for Bob, it allows him to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While I could accept $90, there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering. 
* **John is a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me the security to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great deal for you, considering what the product is worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Value Proposition:**  I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of its worth.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is still friendly and encouraging, keeping the negotiation amicable. 
* **Not Too Low:**  $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I'm getting a reasonable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $100? I really like the product, but I have to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price, and it risks losing Bob as a buyer entirely.
* **John is a Safe Option:**  John is willing to pay $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer. This makes John the better choice in terms of maximizing profit.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag things out, potentially costing me time and the opportunity to sell to other buyers.  

Therefore, selling to John is the most logical and financially advantageous decision."
