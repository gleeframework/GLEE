Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that is mutually beneficial.  I also state my willingness to negotiate to make Bob feel like he has a chance to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value, but it's still worth negotiating further.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $135? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is below my minimum value. While I could try to counteroffer again, it's likely the negotiation will continue to go lower, and I'm running the risk of not getting a better price. 

It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $100, guaranteeing I at least reach my minimum acceptable value."
