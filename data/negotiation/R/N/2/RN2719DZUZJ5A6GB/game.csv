"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I appreciate your perspective on the value. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider $1,900,000? This reflects the true worth of the product while hopefully fitting within your budget.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $1,900,000 is quite high given my budget constraints. Could you possibly lower the price to $1,600,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
