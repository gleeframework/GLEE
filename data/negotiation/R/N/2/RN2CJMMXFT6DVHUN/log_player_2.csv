"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth $12,000. Let's proceed with this fair price and ensure both of us are satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is starting at her highest price. There's no harm in seeing if she's willing to come down, especially since I have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer tests Alice's willingness to negotiate. Even if she rejects this offer, it gives me room to move up while staying well below my $12,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value and uniqueness of the product, I propose a price of $11,500. This allows for a reasonable compromise while still reflecting the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice came down a bit, but I still think there's room for negotiation. It's worth countering again to see if I can get closer to $10,000.  I'm willing to risk it since I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?"", ""product_price"": 10750}

**Reasoning:** I'm splitting the difference between her counteroffer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also holds firm on getting a significant discount. It keeps us moving towards a price I'm comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This still reflects its value while allowing for a more reasonable agreement for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but her concessions are getting smaller.  $11,000 is a decent price, saving me $1,000 from John's offer.  It's unlikely I'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point, and it's better to secure the purchase now."
