{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached the final round of negotiation with Alice, and while her offer of $8,400 is tempting, it's still above his target. He's already invested significant time and energy into the negotiations and has been unable to get a price he's comfortable with.  He's now at the point where it's more advantageous to cut his losses and buy from John at $8,000 to ensure he gets the product at a price that meets his needs."
