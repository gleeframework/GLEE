"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still beneficial to try and negotiate further.  You're aiming to save as much as possible and there's room for Alice to lower the price.  Rejecting allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend $10000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I can do $11500, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial $12,000 price, and $11,500 is a good deal for Bob. While he might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and going back to her original price or even increasing it is present.  Accepting the offer ensures a good price and avoids any risk of losing out on the deal."
