"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe an initial offer of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and proceeding to the next round to negotiate a lower price is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is significantly below its value.  I could consider letting it go for $12,500. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best strategy to try and achieve a lower price. There are still rounds left to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $10,500. This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
