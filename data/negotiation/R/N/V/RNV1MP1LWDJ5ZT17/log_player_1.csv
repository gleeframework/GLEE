Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but unfortunately, $1,400,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it still allows you to make a significant profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
