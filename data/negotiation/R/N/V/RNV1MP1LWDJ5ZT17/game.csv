"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it represents a great opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but unfortunately, $1,400,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it still allows you to make a significant profit.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. While $1,250,000 is a decent offer, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product at that price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which represents a significant investment for me, and allows you to get closer to your desired price. This is a fair offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.
