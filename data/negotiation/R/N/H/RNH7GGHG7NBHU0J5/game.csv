"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not comfortable meeting you in the middle at $120. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $135? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $130? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if that works for you.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $127? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth the price, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",127.0,Bob,6,
