Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for a better deal:** I don't know Bob's valuation of the product, so there's a chance he might be willing to pay more than $12,000. 
* **Minimizing risk:** By setting the price higher, I reduce the risk of selling it to John for the minimum price.
* **Negotiation room:** If Bob rejects my offer, I can always come down slightly in price to try and secure a sale.

It's a strategic move to maximize my profit, while also keeping the potential for a deal with Bob alive."
