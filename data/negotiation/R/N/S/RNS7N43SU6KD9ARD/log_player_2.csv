"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than its value to her, it's still more than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000, making it the more financially sound decision."
