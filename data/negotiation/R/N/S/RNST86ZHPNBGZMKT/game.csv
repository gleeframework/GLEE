"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. How about we meet in the middle from my previous offer, at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $9,500 still leaves me feeling like I'm not getting a fair deal. I'm willing to come down a little further, to $10,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so how about we try $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $9,250 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,750, which is right in the middle of our last offers. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price for this product. What do you say?",9750.0,Alice,7,
