Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your minimum ($1,200,000) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) creates a negotiation space. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" and a ""limited-time offer"" might incentivize Bob to act quickly.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** You make a profit of $1,100,000, which is $100,000 less than John's offer but still a significant gain.
* **If Bob Rejects:** You move on to John and secure your guaranteed $1,200,000."
