"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price you're willing to pay from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice. There's a chance you can get a better deal with Alice without resorting to John's higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move that aims to get Alice to come down on her price.  I'm hoping she'll see that my offer is still within a reasonable range, considering the potential deal with John, and be willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $400,000 is still a decent price, but there's room for negotiation. I'm choosing to reject and counteroffer again because:

* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe I can get a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. 
* **Avoiding John's high price:** I'm still trying to avoid paying John's $1,000,000 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still want a price closer to my target.  The new offer is a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's latest price. This approach could encourage Alice to come closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come up slightly in her offer, and while it's still above my desired price, it's getting closer.  Considering these factors:

* **Alice's increasing offers:** She's showing a willingness to compromise.
* **John's high price:**  I'm still significantly better off with Alice's offer compared to buying from John.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** It's possible I could get a lower price with further negotiation, but there's no guarantee.

I'm choosing to accept Alice's offer as it's a reasonable compromise that saves me a significant amount of money compared to John's price."
