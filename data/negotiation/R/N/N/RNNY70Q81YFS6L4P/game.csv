"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make a deal!",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1050000 is a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1100000.
