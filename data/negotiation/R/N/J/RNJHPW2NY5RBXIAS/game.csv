,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I like the product, $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $105 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $105 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $110. That's a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $108? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",108.0,Bob,4,
