"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, though.  I'm willing to pay $850000. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $850000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to reach an agreement. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1000000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $900000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I believe this is a good compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, and I'm eager to make this deal happen.  $900000 is still a bit below what I need, but to show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $950000.  This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to gain something. Let's finalize this agreement. ",950000.0,Alice,5,
