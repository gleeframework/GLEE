"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $10000. This is a high-quality item that I believe will greatly benefit you, given its value to you is estimated at $12000. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. The product is worth $12,000 to him, but only $8,000 to Alice.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to propose a lower price and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm happy to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a revised offer. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. How about $9500 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's ideal price:** At $9,500, Alice's offer is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer of $9,000. This means a potential saving of $2,500 compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation might not yield significant savings:**  There's less room for negotiation at this point. Pushing for a lower price might risk losing the deal with Alice and forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price. 
* **Time is a factor:**  While more negotiation might save a little, the risk of losing Alice's deal and having to buy from John is too great."
