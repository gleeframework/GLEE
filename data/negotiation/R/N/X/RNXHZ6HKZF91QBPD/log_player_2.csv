"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is good, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($1,000,000) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. This tactic aims to bring Alice closer to my acceptable price range. 
* **Leaving Room:** I know my walk-away price is $1,200,000 (John's offer). This leaves me with $200,000 of negotiating space.
* **Gauging Reaction:** This first counteroffer will help gauge Alice's flexibility. Her response will give me a better understanding of how much lower she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you think the initial price is a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1,400,000. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down significantly, $1,400,000 is still $200,000 over my budget, and I know I have a fallback option with John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for Alice to reduce the price further. I started low, so I anticipated this might take a few rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to being able to make this work. How about we settle at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** I'm moving up from my initial offer, but staying well below her current offer to signal I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Targeting Below Budget:** Aiming for $1,100,000 gives me a buffer below my $1,200,000 walk-away point and a potential $100,000 in savings.
* **Testing Flexibility:**  This counteroffer will reveal if Alice is willing to go below the $1,200,000 mark."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is only $100,000 over my walk-away price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Saving Some Money:**  While not ideal, I'm still saving $100,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Further negotiation risks Alice backing out or me having to settle for John's offer anyway. It's better to secure the deal now."
