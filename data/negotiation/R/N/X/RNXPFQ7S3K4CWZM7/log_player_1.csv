{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value.** This makes the offer attractive and incentivizes Bob to accept.
* **It's above your minimum acceptable price.** This ensures you still make a profit and get a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation.**  You can adjust your offer based on Bob's response, giving you flexibility throughout the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to go for a quick sale, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $850,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm confident I can get a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $775,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. Let's compromise at $825,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price considering your valuation and my own. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a tricky situation.  Bob's offer matches what John is willing to pay. While I'd love to get more, I'm confident that I can get the same price from John without any further hassle. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll go any higher."
