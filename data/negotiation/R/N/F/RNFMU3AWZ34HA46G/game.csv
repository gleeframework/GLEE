"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too far below my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal work.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
