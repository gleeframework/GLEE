"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am currently working within a budget that doesn't allow for such a high price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand you have budgetary considerations. However, the value this product brings is truly significant. I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000.  This is a more reasonable compromise, don't you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budgetary constraints. I've reviewed your latest offer and while it's more reasonable, I still feel there's room for negotiation.
