"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $9,500. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John's offer of $12,000.
* While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting her offer still saves you $2,500 compared to buying from John."
