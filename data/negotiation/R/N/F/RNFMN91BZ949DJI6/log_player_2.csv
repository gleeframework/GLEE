"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal, it's still above your ideal price point of $150. There's room for negotiation to try and bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $120? I'm really interested in this product and would be happy to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $125 is within my budget and represents a good compromise.  It's a better deal than buying from John for $150, and further negotiation might not lead to a significantly lower price."
