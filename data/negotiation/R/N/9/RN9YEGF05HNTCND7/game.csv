"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is far too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, how about we agree on $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, but $17,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I see you're serious about purchasing. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm getting closer to my limit, but  $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $12,000 even? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
