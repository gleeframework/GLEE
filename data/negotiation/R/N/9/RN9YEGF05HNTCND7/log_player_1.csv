"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is far too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, how about we agree on $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment."", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, but $17,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate. We're still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, so I'll counter-offer again to try and move closer to a more agreeable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I see you're serious about purchasing. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal."", 
""product_price"": 15500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm getting closer to my limit, but  $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $12,000 even? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now hit his maximum valuation and is unlikely to go any higher. While continuing the negotiation might result in a slightly better price from Bob, it's risky. Accepting John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable price and avoids potentially wasting more time in a negotiation that is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome."
