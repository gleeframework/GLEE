"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer allows room for negotiation. While it's a large difference from Alice's initial offer, it opens the conversation and gauges her willingness to move on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product offers significant value, and to be fair to what it brings, I would need to see a price closer to $1,400,000. Let me know if that's within the realm of possibility for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice reduced her price, it's still considerably higher than your budget and John's offer. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating and see how low Alice is willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. To be honest, $1,400,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I could potentially go up to $950,000.  Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**  We are increasing our offer to demonstrate serious interest but staying well below Alice's current offer. This keeps us in the negotiation while aiming for a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However,  $950,000 is just too far from where I need to be to make this deal work.  I'm committed to finding a fair agreement, so I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. However, I do have another potential buyer, and that's my absolute bottom line. Let me know if that's workable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** Alice has reached her bottom line at $1,200,000, which is above your maximum budget. There's no room left for negotiation with her. You can get the product from John for $1,000,000, saving you $200,000."
