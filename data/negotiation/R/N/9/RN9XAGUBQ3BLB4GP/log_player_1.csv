Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,600,000, you anchor the negotiation around a higher value, making a price closer to $1,200,000 seem more reasonable to Bob later on.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will also give you a sense of how interested Bob is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're serious about a higher price and are willing to walk away if necessary. This keeps the door open for a counteroffer that's more in line with your goals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product offers significant value, and to be fair to what it brings, I would need to see a price closer to $1,400,000. Let me know if that's within the realm of possibility for you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Higher Counter:** By countering at $1,400,000, you're still aiming high but showing some flexibility. The significant jump from Bob's offer emphasizes the gap in your valuations.
* **Justification:**  You're reiterating the product's value, reminding Bob why it's worth more than his initial offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** Your language (""closer to,"" ""realm of possibility"") implies that you're willing to negotiate further, but only if Bob makes a substantial move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. To be honest, $1,400,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I could potentially go up to $950,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is now closer to his perceived value of $1,000,000, his offer of $950,000 is still significantly below your minimum of $1,200,000. It's time to signal that you're getting closer to your walk-away point and John's offer is becoming a more attractive alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However,  $950,000 is just too far from where I need to be to make this deal work.  I'm committed to finding a fair agreement, so I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. However, I do have another potential buyer, and that's my absolute bottom line. Let me know if that's workable for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** You're moving directly to your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This signals that this is your best and final offer.
* **Introducing Competition:** By mentioning another buyer (John), you're creating a sense of urgency and scarcity. Bob knows that if he doesn't agree to your terms, he risks losing the opportunity to purchase the product.
* **Clear and Firm:** You're communicating clearly that this is non-negotiable. This puts the ball in Bob's court to either accept your final offer or walk away."
