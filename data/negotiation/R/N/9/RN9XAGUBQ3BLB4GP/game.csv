"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product offers significant value, and to be fair to what it brings, I would need to see a price closer to $1,400,000. Let me know if that's within the realm of possibility for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. To be honest, $1,400,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I could potentially go up to $950,000.  Would that work for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However,  $950,000 is just too far from where I need to be to make this deal work.  I'm committed to finding a fair agreement, so I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. However, I do have another potential buyer, and that's my absolute bottom line. Let me know if that's workable for you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
