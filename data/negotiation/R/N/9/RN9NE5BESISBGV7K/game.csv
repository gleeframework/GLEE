"Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is already a very competitive price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident I can get this product for $8,000 elsewhere. Is there any flexibility at all in your price? I'm really keen on this product, but I simply can't go higher than that.",8000.0,Bob,4,
