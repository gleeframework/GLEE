Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing that my minimum acceptable price is $80. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone in the message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than just rejecting the offer outright."
