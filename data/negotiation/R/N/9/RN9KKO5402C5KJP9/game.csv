"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1600000 is a bit below my minimum expectation. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique item. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is a compromise that I think we can both be comfortable with.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm starting to think we're really close to a deal. However, I still need to get as close to my minimum price as possible.
