# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm asking for $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation of the product, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's more advantageous for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,200,000."
