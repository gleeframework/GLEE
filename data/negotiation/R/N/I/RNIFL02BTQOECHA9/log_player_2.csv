"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a product that I believe would be of great interest to you.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you at $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so a price closer to that would be more favorable.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potential for a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,150,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for significantly more than the product's worth to her.  While her offer is lower than the previous round, there's still room for negotiation to find a price that's more favorable for both parties. Rejecting allows for another counteroffer to try and reach a better agreement."
