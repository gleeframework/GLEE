Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, giving you a good price and allowing me to make a solid profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, making it appealing to Bob. However, it still leaves me with a profit of $400,000.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting the benefits for both of us. This approach helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Next Steps:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further. However, I will always keep my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 in mind, and I'm ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal, but I'm not willing to go above that price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this stage. I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or sell to John for a much higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $1,100,000.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm  acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal, emphasizing my willingness to negotiate, and framing the offer as a fair compromise. 
* **Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider my options.  I may offer a slightly lower price in the next round, but I won't go below $1,000,000.  If the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome, I'll  consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer,  $950,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price, especially considering John is willing to pay significantly more. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired range, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as it's the lowest I'm willing to go while still maintaining a reasonable profit.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's compromise, but emphasizing the need for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm framing the offer as a final chance to reach an agreement.
* **Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer, and I'll be able to secure a much better price by selling to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $925,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my means. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $925,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already made several compromises and am unwilling to go any lower.  Given that John is ready to pay $1,500,000, it makes more financial sense to sell the product to him and secure a much higher profit.  I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer and this is the best decision for my financial interests."
