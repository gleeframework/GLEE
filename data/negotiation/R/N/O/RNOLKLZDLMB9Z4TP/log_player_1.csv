Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $150 as possible, since that's our guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still staying above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Appeal to Value:** Highlighting the ""value"" aims to shift Bob's focus from the price difference to the perceived benefits of the product. 

This strategy aims for a win-win scenario where we potentially secure a higher profit than John's offer, while Bob could still get the product at a price lower than our initial ask."
