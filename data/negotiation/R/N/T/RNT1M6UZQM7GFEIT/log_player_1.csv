Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a time-sensitive offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Value Justification:**  While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message implies the product is highly sought after.
* **Urgency:** Creating a sense of urgency might push Bob to accept the offer quickly, fearing he might miss out. 
* **Alternative Buyer (Implicit):** By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" you subtly remind Bob he's not the only option, increasing the product's perceived value.

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, there's always a risk Bob might reject the offer, leading you to sell at your baseline price to John."
