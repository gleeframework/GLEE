Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value"" to justify the high price. 
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

By starting at $1,500,000, you leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a significantly higher profit than your guaranteed sale price."
