"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it brings to the table. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  While $950,000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price if you can agree to [insert a small, easily agreeable term here, like a positive product review or a future referral]. It's a significant discount, and that small addition would make a difference for me.",950000.0,Alice,5,
