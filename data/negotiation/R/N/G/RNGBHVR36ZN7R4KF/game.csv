"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $75. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reviewing your counteroffer, I am proposing a price of $90 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer, aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget while still providing value for our product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $82. I believe this price is more in line with my budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm still interested in the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",82.0,Bob,4,
