"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than John's price, you can still potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Alice's offer of $140 is a good starting point, but we know the product is worth less to her.
* **Midpoint:** By offering $120, we're aiming for a price roughly halfway between her value ($100) and our maximum ($150).
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving some room for Alice to counter if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price Comparison:**  Alice's offer of $130 is better than John's price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Value:** While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small. It's likely that Alice won't go much lower, and we risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of further negotiation isn't worth the potential reward. It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a good price."
