"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $180 is a bit high for me. I'd be happy to pay $130.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that 180 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for 160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - how about $140?  I'm serious about wanting this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 140. I'm willing to make another compromise - I can offer you the product for 155. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still above my budget. I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go any higher than $145. This is my final offer.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 145. I'm willing to make one more compromise - I can offer you the product for 152. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",152.0,Alice,7,
