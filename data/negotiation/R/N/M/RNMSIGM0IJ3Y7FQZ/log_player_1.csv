{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you, and it allows for some room for negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still leaving yourself room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It doesn't seem overly aggressive or unreasonable, making it more likely Bob will engage in further discussion.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profits while still being open to negotiation. By starting at $1,200,000, you're setting the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation while still allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you'd like to get.  You have the leverage to push for a higher price. It's worth continuing the negotiation, especially since John's offer is a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is still quite a bit below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both some room to compromise. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **It's a reasonable compromise:** It's a significant move from your initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **It's still above Bob's offer:** You're not settling for his price right away, demonstrating you value the product.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, you have room to go down a bit more before needing to consider John's offer.

This counteroffer shows Bob that you're serious about getting a good price, but you're also open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our respective valuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum. You can continue to push for a higher price, as you still have John's offer as a safety net. It's worth seeing if you can reach a more favorable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a very fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a small concession:** It shows you're willing to compromise, but not at a drastic price drop.
* **Is still above Bob's offer:** You're not giving in entirely to his price, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Keeps John's offer in mind:** You're still close enough to your minimum that you can confidently continue negotiating. 

This counteroffer balances flexibility with a firm stance on your desired price, keeping the negotiation moving toward a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am willing to consider $1,025,000 as a fair compromise between our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to your minimum of $1,000,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and you'll be forced to sell to John at a lower price.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and secures a price that's within a reasonable range of your desired outcome."
