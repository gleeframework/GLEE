,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $10,250. This is my final offer. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",9800.0,Bob,6,
