Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm going to try and negotiate a bit more with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price,  $12,750 is still a good profit for me, and it seems like Bob is firm on his position. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for a much lower price."
