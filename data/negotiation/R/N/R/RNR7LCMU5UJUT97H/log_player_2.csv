"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny!  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He's offering a significant price reduction from Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer is a strong starting point for negotiations and should encourage Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $13,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a deal closer to his initial counteroffer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to find a compromise while staying within his budget.  This counteroffer is a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.  This strategy might encourage Alice to accept and close the deal."
