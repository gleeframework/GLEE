"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I'm confident that this product is worth more than $12,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $12,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
