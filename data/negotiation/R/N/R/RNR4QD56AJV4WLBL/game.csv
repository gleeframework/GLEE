"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant amount considering my maximum limit.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial limitations.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you and the fact that you're willing to pay $850,000 initially, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you at $920,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the offer of $920,000. However, I'm still not comfortable going that high.  I'm willing to meet you at $910,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me at $910,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $915,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to make a final concession to reach an agreement.",915000.0,Alice,7,
