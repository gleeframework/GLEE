Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position. However, the gap between our valuations remains significant.  I'm willing to make my final offer: $1,180,000. This reflects my sincere desire to close this deal with you, while also recognizing the product's inherent value.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer and she's unlikely to go below $1,180,000.  While you might be able to get her down a bit more, it's not worth the risk. You have a guaranteed option with John for $1,000,000, saving you at least $180,000."
