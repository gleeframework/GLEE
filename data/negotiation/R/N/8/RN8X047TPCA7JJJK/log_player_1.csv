``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving you a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $7,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$7,000 is still too low. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer Bob again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
