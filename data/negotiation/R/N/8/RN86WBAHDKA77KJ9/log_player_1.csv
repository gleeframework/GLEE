Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's valuation but still allows room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter and potentially close the deal with him. However, I'm always aware that I have a guaranteed $10,000 offer from John, so I won't be afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
