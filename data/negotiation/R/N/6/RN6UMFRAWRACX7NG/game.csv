"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This still gives you a good price and allows me to get a fair return on the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a little high, but I'm willing to go up to $120.  This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for that price. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,4,
