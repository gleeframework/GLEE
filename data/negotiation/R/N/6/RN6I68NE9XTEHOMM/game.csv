"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $9500 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9500 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8200. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the compromise. I appreciate that. However, $8200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value I see in it, and it's closer to where I can comfortably land.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7500 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $8000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7750. It's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",7750.0,Bob,6,
