"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price of $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's still a great price for a product worth $8,000 to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving a bit closer, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,250. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd need $8,000 to make it worth my while. Let's try $8,000, and we can call it a deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
