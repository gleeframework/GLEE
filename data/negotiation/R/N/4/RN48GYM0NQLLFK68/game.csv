"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on this.  How about $9,500? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",9500.0,Alice,3,
