"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for the best possible price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 is below what I can accept. Would you consider $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while giving us both a good deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest, the product's worth is considerably higher than your current offer.  I'd be willing to go down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
