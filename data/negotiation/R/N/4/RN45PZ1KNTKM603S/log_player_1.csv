# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. That's the maximum I can afford.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. $8,500 is still too low for me, and I want to see if I can negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to my bottom line, but it's still not enough.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and it seems like he's not willing to budge much. It's time to move on."
