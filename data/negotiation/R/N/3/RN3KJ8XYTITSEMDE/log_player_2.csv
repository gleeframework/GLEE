"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still potential to save more.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice is willing to go lower to secure the deal, and Bob has the safety net of John's offer if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  He's proposing a price that's $200,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a substantial reduction and likely to be a good starting point for negotiations.  Bob wants to find out if Alice is willing to negotiate and if she has a lower price point in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is aiming to save as much as possible and rejecting this offer allows him to continue bargaining for a lower price. While $1,150,000 is a good deal, Bob wants to see if he can achieve a price closer to his $1,000,000 counteroffer. If he fails, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a gradual but steady decrease in price.  He's proposing $1,100,000, which is $50,000 less than Alice's last offer. This shows that Bob is serious about getting a lower price but isn't pushing too aggressively, hoping to keep the negotiations amicable.  He's also staying within a range that's potentially acceptable to Alice, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has counter-offered at $1,175,000, which is only $25,000 higher than Bob's last offer.  At this point, continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a significant saving.  Bob can secure the product for a price that is significantly lower than John's offer.  Given that Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it saves him $325,000."
