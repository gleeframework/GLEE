Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $12,500. This is a fair price considering you're still getting a profit, and it's a good starting point for us to find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $13,000 for the product. This is a good compromise that gets us closer to a deal while still allowing you a reasonable profit.  What do you think?
