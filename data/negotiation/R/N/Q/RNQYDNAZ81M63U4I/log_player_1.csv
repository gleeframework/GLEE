Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high but reasonable price:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 aims to maximize profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob. He gains a $50,000 discount compared to your guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" and calling it a ""one-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer rather than risk losing the opportunity.

This strategy balances maximizing your potential earnings while still presenting a compelling offer to Bob."
