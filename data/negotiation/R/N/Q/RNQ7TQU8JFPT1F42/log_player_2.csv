"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $750000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. We believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $750,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which would still be a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still not comfortable with the price. After re-evaluating our options, we're willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. We're willing to sell the product to you for $725000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and $725,000 is a good deal.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or needing to buy from John for $800,000 is too high.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $75,000 compared to John's price."
