Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $750,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $700000 for the product, which would still be a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still not comfortable with the price.
