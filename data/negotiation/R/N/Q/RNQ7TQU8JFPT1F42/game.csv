"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $700000 for the product, which would still be a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still not comfortable with the price. After re-evaluating our options, we're willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. We're willing to sell the product to you for $725000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800000.",725000.0,Alice,3,
