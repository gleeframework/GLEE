Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm also leaving room for negotiation, as it's likely Bob won't accept this first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, so I need to push for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a new price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's a significant decrease from my original offer. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant decrease from my previous offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise. However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not giving up on getting a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a price I'm not happy with. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements."
