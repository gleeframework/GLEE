Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay that amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,500,000 is a strong offer, this product's unique value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,600,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. There's a risk he'll walk away entirely if I counter, leaving me to accept John's offer. It's better to secure a good deal now."
