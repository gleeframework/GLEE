,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I can meet you at $10,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let's see if we can finally agree on a price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
