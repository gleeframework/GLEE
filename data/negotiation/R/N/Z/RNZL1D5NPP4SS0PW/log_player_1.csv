{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $17,000. This is a compromise from my original offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still allows me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $16,500 is still a good profit and a significant amount of money. I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to settle for John's offer of $12,000."
