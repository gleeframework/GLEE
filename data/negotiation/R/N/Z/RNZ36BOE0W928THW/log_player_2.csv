You can do better than $11,500. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering $10,500. This is still a good deal for Alice, as it's above her valuation of $10,000, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed."

I'm offering $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident Alice will accept it."

It looks like we've reached a point where Alice is unlikely to budge much further.  $11,300 is a better price than John's offer, so it's time to accept and get the product."
