Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value is $100.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there is still room for negotiation.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price to $125.  This is still a good profit for me, and I hope it's attractive enough for Bob to consider. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I don't want to go too low too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems determined to get the product for the minimum price.  I've already compromised once, and I'm not willing to go lower.  It's time to move on and sell to John, guaranteeing me a profit of $100."
