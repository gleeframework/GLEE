"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your interest in selling, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a bit closer to the original price I had in mind. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to sell the product at a price that's above your valuation.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiation, Bob. I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. However, I was thinking that $1,000,000 is still a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $1,050,000 to make it worth my while. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000. This is a very fair price, allowing you to make a substantial profit while still keeping me within my budget. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further negotiations.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
