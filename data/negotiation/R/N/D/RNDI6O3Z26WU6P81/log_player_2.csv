It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $600,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for negotiation.  Let's see what Alice's counteroffers look like."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}

I'm going to start by making a significant counteroffer at $450,000. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if she's not open to a substantial discount."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

We're getting close, but $550,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to counter one last time before considering buying from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 525000}
