{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product description, without revealing its exact nature] that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Product description:** I've kept it vague to avoid revealing too much information about the product's value.
* **Price:**  I've started with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to give myself room to negotiate.  
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to make a counteroffer. I can then adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum, but it's worth exploring whether I can get a higher price.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $135? This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and express a willingness to negotiate.  I propose a price in the middle ground, showing flexibility. 
* **Price:**  $135 is a compromise, allowing me to potentially get a better price than John's offer while still being reasonable. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and hopefully secure a deal that's beneficial to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go a bit lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is still above my minimum of $100, and it's getting closer to my initial desired price.  It's likely that further negotiation will lead to a price closer to his initial $120 offer, which I'm not sure I'm willing to go down to.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a price above John's offer, making it the most profitable choice at this point."
