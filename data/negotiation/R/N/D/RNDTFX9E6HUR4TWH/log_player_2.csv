Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to be sure the price is right. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This product is worth a lot to both of us, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  $1,100,000 is still a good deal for me, and accepting avoids further negotiation and the risk of Alice hardening her stance."
