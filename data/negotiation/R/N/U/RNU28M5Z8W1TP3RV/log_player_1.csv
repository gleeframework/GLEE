"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By starting at $12,000, I have some room to negotiate down if necessary without dropping below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I have 8 rounds left, which gives me ample opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** Although John is willing to pay my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob before settling for that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is a little low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $10,500 for the product. This still offers you a great deal considering its value, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and signals a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him that the offer is still a good deal even at the higher price. 
* **Maintain Room to Negotiate:** While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I still have some room to budge if necessary. This allows for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for meeting me halfway, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm not yet ready to accept. 
* **Time to counter again:** I have 6 rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm still confident I can reach a more profitable agreement. 
* **John is still a backup:**  Though selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're getting closer to what I need. While $9,800 is still a bit low, I'm willing to make a final concession. I'll accept $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to make a final compromise, hoping to push Bob to accept.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I highlight the fairness of the price, making it appealing to Bob while still being within my acceptable range.
* **Urgency:** I urge Bob to make a final decision, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging a quicker resolution.

This counteroffer aims to close the deal while still ensuring I receive a price that's significantly closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** I have only 4 rounds left, and the negotiations seem to be getting more challenging.
* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm grateful for Bob's willingness to negotiate, his final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation and ensures I get a good return on my product.

At this point, it's wiser to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to risk losing more time and money with Bob."
