"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price with further negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $90. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a price that's above my minimum. I believe this will encourage Bob to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $87 is only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer. With limited rounds remaining, I'd rather secure a sale at a reasonable price than risk losing the deal altogether."
