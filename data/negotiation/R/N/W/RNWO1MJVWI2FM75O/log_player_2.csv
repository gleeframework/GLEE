"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. I think it's a great deal for something of such high quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation of the product. It's best to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start significantly lower than our actual budget ($80) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Polite and Interested:** We maintain a positive and polite tone to encourage Alice to continue the bargaining process. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This low offer helps gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $60 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. Could you do $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still way above your budget. While she came down a bit, it's best to see if she's willing to move closer to a reasonable price. You can always go with John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $60 is low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $80? That's the most I can offer for it."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer, Firm Limit:** We're significantly increasing our offer to show Alice we're serious while establishing our maximum budget as a firm limit.
* **Seeking Compromise:** ""Meeting in the middle"" suggests a willingness to compromise and encourages Alice to do the same.
* **Transparency:** We're being upfront about our budget, which can sometimes expedite negotiations."
