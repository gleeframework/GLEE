"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  If you're interested, let me know, and we can finalize the transaction.  If not, I'll be selling it to John for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice is trying to sell the product for more than it's worth to you. You can get it for $10,000 from John, so rejecting her offer makes sense."
