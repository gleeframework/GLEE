Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's unique value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Balance Risk:** Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and forcing a sale to John at $800,000. 

This strategy aims to secure a significant profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
