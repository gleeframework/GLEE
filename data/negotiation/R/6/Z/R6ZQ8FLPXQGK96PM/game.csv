"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While $1,100,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this reflects its worth while still offering you a good deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
