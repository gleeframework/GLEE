"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more reasonable for you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $9,500. I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value I place on the product.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $10,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm counteroffering at $10,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $10,250 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $9,750. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a significant compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $9,750. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering the product to you for $10,000, but I'll throw in a special bonus worth $250. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal.
