"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum, but I want to see if he'll bite at this price first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'm going to try and counteroffer with something a little closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise from my initial offer and closer to Bob's offer. I think it's a fair price that will hopefully convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $92 is a good price, especially given the limited rounds remaining. It's also significantly better than selling to John.  I'm not sure if I could push for a higher price and still close the deal in the remaining rounds."
