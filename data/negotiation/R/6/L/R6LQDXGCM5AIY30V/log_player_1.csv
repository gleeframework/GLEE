Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target:**  My goal is to maximize my profit, so I want to get as close to Bob's value of $15,000 as possible.
* **Risk:**  If I ask for too much, Bob might reject the offer, and I'll only get $8,000 from John.
* **Strategy:**  I'm offering $12,000, which is a good compromise. It's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and it gives Bob a good deal, leaving him with $3,000 in value. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a good profit for me."
