Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and signals the product's value to you. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, I'm aiming to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if the price is too high for him, it sets a benchmark that might make his counteroffer closer to my desired range.
* **John as Leverage:** I have the security of John's offer, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob.  

This is just the opening move. I'm prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's reactions and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a substantial gap between his offer and my starting price, indicating there's room for negotiation. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  I'm not in a position where I need to accept a low offer immediately. I can leverage John's offer to maintain a strong negotiating position. 

I'll counter with a price that moves closer to Bob's offer but still keeps me within a reasonable distance from my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To find a middle ground, I could consider $1,800,000. This reflects the true value and potential I see this product bringing to your business."", ""product_price"": 1800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by a significant amount ($400,000) to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a brief explanation to anchor the new price to the ""value and potential"" the product offers, subtly shifting focus away from his initial low offer.
* **Holding Ground:**  While I'm making a concession, I'm still significantly above both his offer and my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for further negotiation while aiming for a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still out of my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000.  It's a fair price given the value we both see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has not budged from his initial offer of $1,000,000, even after I made a significant concession. This suggests he's unwilling to meet me closer to my acceptable range.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further stalemates and wasted time.  I have a guaranteed offer from John that meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Significant Loss:** While I could potentially earn more by continuing with Bob, there's no guarantee he'll ever reach a price I'm willing to accept.  

It's in my best interest to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk getting stuck in a dead-end negotiation with Bob."
