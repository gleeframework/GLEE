Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm not ready to settle for $1,100,000 yet, as it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,250,000?  This still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,175,000. This would allow us both to make a decent profit and avoid further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my target.  I'm not ready to settle yet, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise.  While $1,175,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm offering $1,225,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,225,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm proposing $1,210,000 as a final offer. This price is very close to your asking price and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,210,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,210,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,210,000 is only $10,000 below my minimum acceptable price.  Considering the limited rounds remaining, and the fact that John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm willing to accept this offer to secure the deal.  It's a good compromise, and I can still make a substantial profit."
