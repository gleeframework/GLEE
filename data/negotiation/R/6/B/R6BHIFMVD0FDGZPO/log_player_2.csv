``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,250,000?  This still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise.  While $1,175,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm offering $1,225,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.
