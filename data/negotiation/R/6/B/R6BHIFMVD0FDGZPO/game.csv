"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,250,000?  This still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,175,000. This would allow us both to make a decent profit and avoid further negotiation.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise.  While $1,175,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm offering $1,225,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,225,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm proposing $1,210,000 as a final offer. This price is very close to your asking price and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1210000.0,Bob,6,
