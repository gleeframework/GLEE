# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $7,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you consider $6,500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
