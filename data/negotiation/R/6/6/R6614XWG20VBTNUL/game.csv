"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $7,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you consider $6,500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings.",6800.0,Alice,3,
