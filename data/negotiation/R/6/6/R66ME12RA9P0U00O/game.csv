"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,150,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,175,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product, but I need to be convinced that this is the best price I can get. Can you meet me at $1,150,000 or lower?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
