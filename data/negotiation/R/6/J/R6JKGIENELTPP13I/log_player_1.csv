"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000.  This is a strategic move for a few reasons:

* **Sets the Bar High:** It establishes a high baseline for the negotiations.
* **Gauges Bob's Interest:**  If Bob immediately rejects, it suggests the product is not worth that much to him. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  It provides room for me to lower the price if necessary without feeling like I'm losing too much.

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly in the next round."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to accept Bob's offer right away.  He's starting at the bottom, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 

I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'll need to be careful not to alienate Bob, but I also want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000.  This is a compromise, but it still gives me a profit margin and signals that I'm willing to negotiate.  It's also a significant amount closer to my ideal price than Bob's initial offer. 

My hope is that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and be willing to meet me in the middle.  If he rejects this, I'll have to re-evaluate my strategy, but I'm still feeling optimistic about getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved up to $8,500, which is a better offer than his initial one. While I'd still like to get closer to my ideal price of $9,000, we're running out of rounds.  It's likely that if I reject this offer, Bob might not budge further, and I'd be left with the $8,000 option from John. 

It's a calculated risk, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale at a reasonable price."
