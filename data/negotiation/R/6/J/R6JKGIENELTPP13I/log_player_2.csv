"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's first offer is at Bob's maximum price, there's a good chance Bob can negotiate a lower price.  He has 10 rounds, so there's time to explore."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, offering 20% less than Alice's initial price. This signals to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to negotiate.  He leaves room for further negotiation while still staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly from her initial offer, but it's still not a great deal for Bob. He can likely get a better price, especially since he has multiple rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. He is showing Alice that he is willing to negotiate, but he still wants to get a better price than $9,000. He is also leaving room for Alice to counteroffer again.  Bob is getting closer to his goal of saving money while still potentially getting a good deal."
