"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $18,000 is already a competitive price for this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $15,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm firm on my offer of $12,000.  If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $12,000 offer.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a better outcome. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for the same price, it makes the most sense to sell to John and avoid further haggling."
