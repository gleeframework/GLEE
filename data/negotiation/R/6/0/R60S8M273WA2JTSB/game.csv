"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a fair price considering its value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. If you're open to that, I'd be happy to make the purchase. ",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though! I can offer you the product for $180. It's a fair price considering its value, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",180.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $180 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $80. If you're not able to come down to that, I'm going to have to pass and buy from John.",80.0,Bob,4,
