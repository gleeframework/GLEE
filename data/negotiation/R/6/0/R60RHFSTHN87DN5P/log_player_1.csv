I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $140. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 130}
