Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a price of $19,000 offers a significant markup from your minimum while still being potentially appealing to Bob if the product is worth $15,000 to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests there might be some room for negotiation, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a bit high."
