Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but we also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept.
* **Understanding Value:** We know Bob values the product at $10,000, so offering it for that price or lower guarantees he'll accept, but we lose potential profit.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  $11,500  leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit for Alice. If Bob rejects this offer, Alice can still sell to John for her minimum acceptable price."
