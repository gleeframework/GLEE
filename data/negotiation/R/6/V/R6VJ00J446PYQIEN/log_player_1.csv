"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $975,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob clearly values the product and we have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move towards a mutually agreeable price.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your offer, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could try to push for a bit more, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we're now at $950,000. Accepting ensures a significant profit above our $800,000 minimum and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us running out of negotiation rounds."
