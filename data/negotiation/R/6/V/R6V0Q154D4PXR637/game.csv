"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep my budget below $10,000 for this purchase. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $9,500? I understand if this isn't feasible, but I wanted to ask before moving forward.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I'm confident this price reflects the product's value to you and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'll try one last time. Given the current market conditions and my budget constraints, could we possibly settle at $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
