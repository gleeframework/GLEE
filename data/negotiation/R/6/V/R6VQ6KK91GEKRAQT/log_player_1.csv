Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $100 guaranteed, there's a chance to earn an extra $19 by selling to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $99 is just below my minimum and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""good deal"" for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob could counter-offer, and I can always slightly lower the price to secure the sale."
