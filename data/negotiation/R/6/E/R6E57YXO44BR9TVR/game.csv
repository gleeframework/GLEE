"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $90 is lower than my initial offer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $100? I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. How about we meet at $105?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. ",105.0,Alice,5,
