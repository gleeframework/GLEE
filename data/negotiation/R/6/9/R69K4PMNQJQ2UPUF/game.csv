"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a fair price given its value.  Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This gives you a great deal, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $10,500 is still a little steep. Would you consider $9,750? That's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $9,750 isn't quite there for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,125? This would allow me to make a fair profit, and still give you a great deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $9,900? It's a fair offer, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're very close to a deal.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,
