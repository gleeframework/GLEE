"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me.  However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you consider $120? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $135. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",135.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $135, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $150. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for this amazing product.",150.0,Alice,5,
