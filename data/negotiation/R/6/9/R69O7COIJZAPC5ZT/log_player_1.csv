Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, knowing it's more than Bob values it, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This allows for a back-and-forth without me immediately going to my minimum price.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly approach might encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Prepared for John:**  If Bob rejects, I have a backup buyer in John, guaranteeing I'll get at least $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $100 is below my minimum of $120, so accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While I can sell to John for $120, there's still a chance to get closer to that with Bob through further negotiation. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  By rejecting, I can send a counteroffer and attempt to get a price closer to my desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $110? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my absolute minimum.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly and cooperative tone to encourage continued negotiation.
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer (""fair compromise""),  making it sound more reasonable.
* **Still above minimum:**  $110 is still above my $120 minimum, ensuring I don't lose money even if Bob rejects again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still interested in purchasing the product and would like to counter with $100. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No room for improvement:**  Bob is unwilling to budge from $100, which is below my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  John is guaranteed to buy for $120, ensuring a profit.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially ending up with nothing.

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit with John rather than risk further negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
