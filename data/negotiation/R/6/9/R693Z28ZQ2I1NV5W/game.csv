"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start at a price of $2000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $500000. I believe this price reflects a fair valuation for both parties.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $500000 is a significant discount from the original price, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. My counteroffer is $1250000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While $1250000 is still higher than my preferred price range, I understand your perspective on the product's value. I would like to propose a counter-counteroffer of $750000. This price aims to bridge the gap between our initial offers and could potentially lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $750000 is still a significant discount from the original price, and I'm not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. My counteroffer is $1000000. I think this is a fair price that balances the product's value with your budget constraints.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest proposal, Alice. I appreciate your effort in finding a common ground. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $900000. This price reflects a compromise that considers both the product's value and my budget constraints. I hope this proposal will lead to a satisfactory agreement for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",950000.0,Alice,7,
