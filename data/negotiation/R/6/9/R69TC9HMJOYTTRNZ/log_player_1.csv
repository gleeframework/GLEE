Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see significant value in. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Our goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without losing him to a rejection.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While we start high, the offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, although any agreement below $800,000 would be unacceptable to us. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup ensures we won't be forced to accept a low offer from Bob."
