``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but significantly lower than my minimum of $1,500,000.  This allows room for negotiation while still securing a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $1,200,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is too low for me.  Considering the value you've stated, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefits you'll gain. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

While $750,000 is a better offer than Bob's previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll make another counteroffer, hoping to close the gap further."
