Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice needs to make at least $12,000. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **John's Guaranteed Purchase:** Alice has a guaranteed sale for $12,000 to John.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice's optimal strategy is to offer the product to Bob for a price slightly lower than $12,000. This approach aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** By going slightly below her guaranteed price, Alice can still potentially earn more than $12,000 if Bob accepts.
2. **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  Offering a price too close to $12,000 risks Bob rejecting the offer, leading Alice to sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000.

**Example Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special discounted price of $11,800. I think it would be a great deal for you!"", ""product_price"": 11800}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Message:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting a ""special discounted price"" to entice Bob.
* **The Price:** $11,800 is a compelling offer for Bob, potentially saving him $200 compared to his perceived value. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:**  There's always a chance Bob might counter-offer. Alice can decide if she wants to negotiate further or stick to her minimum of $12,000.
* **Risk Tolerance:** Alice can adjust the price closer to $12,000 if she's less risk-averse and wants to try for a higher profit, keeping in mind the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer."
