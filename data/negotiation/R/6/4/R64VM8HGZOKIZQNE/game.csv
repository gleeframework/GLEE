"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to move closer to my initial offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $10500. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your new counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $11200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value.",11200.0,Alice,5,
