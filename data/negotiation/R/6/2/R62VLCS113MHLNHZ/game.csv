"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I think $1,150,000 is a fair price for me. I'm not willing to go any higher, so I'm offering $1,150,000 for the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get this product, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $1,150,000 is still quite a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is the lowest I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
