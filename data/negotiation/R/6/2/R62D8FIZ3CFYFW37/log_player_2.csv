"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Alice is offering it for $900,000. You have room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $800,000. My goal is to save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product. A counteroffer of $850,000 is a good starting point as it's halfway between Alice's value and my maximum budget. This leaves room for further negotiation, but also shows Alice that I am serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is better than John's offer of $1,000,000.  While there is still room to negotiate, the potential savings of $125,000 are significant.  It's likely Alice won't go lower than her $800,000 value, and risking further negotiation could result in a price closer to John's offer.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a lower price."
