Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This initial offer aims to:

* **Start high:**  The price is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving room for negotiation.
* **Show confidence:**  A bold opening price can signal your belief in the product's worth.
* **Open communication:**  The message invites Bob to engage in a conversation and allows for potential counteroffers. 

Remember, this is just the first step!  You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,150,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1,180,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1180000} 
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates that you're open to negotiating and willing to meet Bob halfway.
* **Maintain your ground:**  The price is still above your minimum threshold, showing that you're not desperate to sell.
* **Frame it positively:** The message emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" and the ""good deal"" for Bob."
