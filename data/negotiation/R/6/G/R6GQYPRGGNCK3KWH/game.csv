"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still unable to meet you halfway at $110. I would like to stick to my original proposal of $100 for the product. If this is not feasible, I will consider purchasing the product from John for $100.",100.0,Bob,4,
