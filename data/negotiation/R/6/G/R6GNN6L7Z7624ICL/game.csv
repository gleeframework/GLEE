"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits it will bring to your business.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does staying within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I'm confident this is a fair offer that reflects the product's worth while allowing me to make a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
