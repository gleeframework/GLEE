Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits it will bring to your business."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does staying within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I'm confident this is a fair offer that reflects the product's worth while allowing me to make a worthwhile investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could hold out for more, accepting $1,100,000 is a significant profit over my baseline. It's always possible to get a higher price, but there's also the risk that Bob walks away. This offer balances risk and reward effectively."
