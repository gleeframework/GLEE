"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $140 is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly opening message builds rapport and makes Bob feel valued.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message indicates I'm open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value & Negotiation:** While $125 is above my minimum of $120, it's still below my desired price and I have room to negotiate further.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $140 by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While selling to John for $120 is an option, I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob for the possibility of a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand it's a bit lower than what I was hoping for. I'm willing to go down to $135, which is a good middle ground.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing I'm flexible by making a counter-offer.
* **Compromise:**  $135 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer of $140.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:**  $130 is very close to my desired price of $135, and is a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer of $125.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit closer to my desired range. 
* **Potential for Delay:**  Rejecting and counter-offering again might prolong the negotiation and increase the risk of Bob withdrawing or another buyer appearing.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could potentially get a higher price, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for $120 is too high."
