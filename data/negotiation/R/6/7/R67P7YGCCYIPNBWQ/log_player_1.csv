Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This would still allow you to make a significant profit and hopefully we can reach an agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
