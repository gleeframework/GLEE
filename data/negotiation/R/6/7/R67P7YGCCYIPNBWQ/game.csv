"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This would still allow you to make a significant profit and hopefully we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant, and I need to be closer to $1,300,000.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I still believe the $1,250,000 price is a bit high, I'm willing to go to $1,150,000. This seems like a fair compromise and hopefully we can finally reach a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
