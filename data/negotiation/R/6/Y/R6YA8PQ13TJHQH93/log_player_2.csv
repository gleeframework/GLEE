"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm asking for $900000 for it. I know it's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd rather see this go to someone who can truly appreciate its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
