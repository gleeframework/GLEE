Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. It's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get the highest price possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Starting High:** I'm starting with an offer above Bob's perceived value ($120) and my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Confident Demeanor:** My message is positive and positions the offer as a ""great deal,"" aiming to influence Bob's perception of value. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a degree of risk. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll still make a profit by selling to John, but I might miss out on a higher potential profit from Bob."
