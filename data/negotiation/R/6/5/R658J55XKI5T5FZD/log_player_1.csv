"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer that's slightly higher than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a great deal. 
* **Acknowledging Value:** The message highlights the product's value, subtly reinforcing why Bob would be willing to pay a high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000) and slightly lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), leaving space for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay a premium for the product, and I still have room to negotiate before reaching my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the immense value this product holds for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic aims for a compromise that feels fair to both parties. It signals willingness to negotiate while still holding onto a strong position.
* **Holding Firm on Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob why he's willing to pay a significant sum.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps the price well above my minimum while still moving closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, encouraging him to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I see the value, $1,000,000 is still a bit too steep. Could we settle at $930,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to my target price, but I'm willing to push a bit further. His willingness to negotiate suggests there's still room for improvement.  We are early enough in the negotiation to keep trying for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product.  Let's make this happen. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and close the deal at $965,000?"",
""product_price"": 965000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:** The message includes phrases like ""Let's make this happen"" to subtly introduce a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to reach a decision.
* **Splitting the Difference (Again):** This continues the pattern of compromise while keeping the price above the halfway point between Bob's last offer and my previous offer. It shows a willingness to be flexible but firm. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This offer is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential further negotiation if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to move a little bit more.  How about $940,000? That's a strong offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $940,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating his strong interest in the product. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away increases with each counteroffer. It's better to secure a very good deal now than risk losing the sale altogether."
