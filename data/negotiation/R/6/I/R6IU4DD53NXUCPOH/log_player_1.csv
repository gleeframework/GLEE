Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects its value. I'm open to negotiations and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to drastically lower my price this early in the game.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

Let's keep the negotiations moving and find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. I'm open to further negotiations and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to $1,500,000 to see if we can reach a compromise. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and while I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offers are getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,500,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's the best way to ensure I don't end up with a deal that's not profitable enough."
