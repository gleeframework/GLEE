"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for you. I'm confident you'll see the potential it has to benefit your business.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to buy it for $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $650,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. I believe $850,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of this product. I'm eager to work with you, but I need to stay within a reasonable price range to make this deal work for me.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. $750,000 is closer, but it's still below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute bottom line. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
