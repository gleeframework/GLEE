{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm offering it at a price of $1,200,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly lower than Bob's maximum allows room for potential counter-offers. Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, but even if he gets a small discount, Alice still wins.
* **Consider the Alternative:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 sets a strong bottom line. Offering it to Bob for $1,200,000 ensures a significant profit regardless."
