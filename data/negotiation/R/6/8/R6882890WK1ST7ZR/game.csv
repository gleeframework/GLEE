"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value and the potential benefits it holds for your business.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant discount and would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a good value for you.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it's the maximum I can pay. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your stance, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and it's a price that allows me to at least partially recover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
