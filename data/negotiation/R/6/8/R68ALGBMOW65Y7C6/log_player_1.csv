{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where I have room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but still leaves me with a significant profit. It also shows that I am willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $10,000 is a good deal for Bob, it's not enough for me. I want to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still leaves me with a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
