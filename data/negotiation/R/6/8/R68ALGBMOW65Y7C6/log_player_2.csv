"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $15,000.** 
* **You have room to negotiate.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to propose a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This still leaves me with a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is now within your budget of $15,000.**
* **You've already successfully negotiated down from her initial price of $12,000.**
* **Accepting the offer saves you $4,000 compared to buying from John.**

While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk is that Alice could become unwilling to sell, and you would be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
