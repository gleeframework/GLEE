"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This still leaves me with a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to you. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
