"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. It's a fair price, considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy it now. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9000, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $8750? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal right now.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8875? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think.",8875.0,Alice,5,
