"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $145. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $145 is within your budget, you can get the product for $150 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for a potential counter-offer, allowing you to potentially secure a better price closer to John's offer."
