"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe the product holds more value and I'm willing to negotiate further. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. It's a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up in his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $17,000.  It's a good price, and we're getting closer to a deal. There's a risk that we might not close the deal and I'll be forced to sell to John for $15,000, but I think it's worth it to take a chance on getting a slightly better price."
