Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Strategic Pricing:** A price of $950,000 is significantly below your minimum but still leaves room for a substantial profit.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The wording emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as a limited-time opportunity, potentially influencing Bob to act quickly. 

This approach seeks to strike a balance between securing the best possible price from Bob while acknowledging the risk that he might reject the offer."
