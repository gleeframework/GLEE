While ideally, I'd want a price closer to $1,300,000, Bob has drawn a hard line. Accepting his offer of $1,220,000 is the most logical choice at this point for a few reasons:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. Continuing to push might make Bob walk away entirely. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The difference between his offer and my goal is shrinking.  Each round's gain is minimal compared to the risk of losing the sale.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** $1,220,000 is still a significant profit margin. Accepting ensures I don't walk away with only John's offer of $1,000,000."
