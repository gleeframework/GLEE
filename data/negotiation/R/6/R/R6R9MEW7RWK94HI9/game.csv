"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to go lower than $130. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $115?  That's a good middle ground for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",125.0,Alice,5,
