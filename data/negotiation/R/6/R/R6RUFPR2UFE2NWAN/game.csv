"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's still within your range.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This is the maximum I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting close!  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal right now. Let me know what you think.",8875.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,875 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but I really need to be at or below that price to make this deal work for me. Can you meet me at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,6,
