Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $9,500?**  This price is a compromise between your minimum acceptable value ($10,000) and Bob's maximum value ($8,000). It gives Bob a decent discount while still allowing you to make a profit. 
* **Risk Analysis:** There's a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, you have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay your minimum price. 
* **Potential Outcome:** If Bob accepts, you gain $9,500. If Bob rejects, you gain $10,000 from John. Either way, you secure a good return on your product."
