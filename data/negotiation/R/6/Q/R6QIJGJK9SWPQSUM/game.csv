"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $16,000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17,000. This would still give me a fair profit, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to keep the cost below $16,000. Could we possibly negotiate down to $15,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
