Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer that still nets you a significant profit above Bob's perceived value. It creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" subtly reminds Bob you have a fallback option if he rejects the offer.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
