"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,250.  This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's work together to make this happen!",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,250 is closer, I'm still only comfortable with paying $8,750.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's make this deal happen!",8750.0,Bob,4,
