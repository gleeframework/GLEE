"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's work something out!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value to both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. This price allows for a healthy profit for you while still being within my acceptable range. Let's meet in the middle!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would give us both a good deal and allow us to move forward with the sale.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is my final offer.  This price allows for a significant profit for you, while still ensuring a fair return for me.  I believe this is a mutually beneficial solution that allows us to finalize this deal.  If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll need to move on to another buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
