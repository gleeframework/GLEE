"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120. It's not worth accepting at this point. You can do better by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $100. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. I want to see if I can get her to come down significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $130 is closer to my budget, it's still slightly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I believe I can still negotiate a lower price, and it's not worth settling for $130 when I have the option to buy from John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $115, moving closer to Alice's last offer but still staying within my budget. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to compromise and encourages Alice to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $125 is very close to my budget, I'm still determined to get the product for the lowest price possible. I'm only $5 away from my target price, and I believe I can still negotiate a lower price. I'm confident that I can secure the product for my desired price or potentially even lower if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm finally offering my maximum price of $120. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it. If she doesn't, I'll go ahead and buy from John for the same price."
