"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but not too aggressively. This allows room for negotiation and gives me some leverage in the first round. I'm interested in gauging Bob's interest at this price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum,  I'm not in a rush and want to see if I can get a better price.  Bob's low offer suggests he might be willing to pay more, and I'll counter with a price higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, but not too drastically. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a better price than his initial offer."
