"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a great price for a product worth $12,000 to you. Let's try to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll accept $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
