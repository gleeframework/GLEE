"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more equitable price. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value. However, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows you to get a valuable asset, while ensuring I get a fair return.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. This aligns closely with the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties involved.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
