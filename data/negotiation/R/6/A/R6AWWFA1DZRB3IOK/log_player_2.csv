"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $14,000. Given its value to you, I believe this is a fair offer that allows us both to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  This price still allows you a good profit while providing me with a significant savings. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your position, I would like to respectfully decline it. My initial offer was based on the value of the product and my costs. I am unable to lower the price further. However, I am open to discussing other terms or conditions that might be beneficial to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has clearly stated she won't go lower than $14,000. Bob has already attempted to negotiate a lower price and been rejected.  While it's possible to keep counter-offering, the risk is that Alice will walk away from the deal entirely.  At this point, buying from John for $15,000 guarantees Bob gets the product, even if it's slightly more expensive than Alice's offer."
