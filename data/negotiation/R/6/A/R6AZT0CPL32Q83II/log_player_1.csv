{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant price reduction from its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** Offering $1,200,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strong Opening:**  The message highlights the value of the product and the potential for a good deal for both parties. 
* **Plan B:**  I have a fallback option with John, so I can walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a significant investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While Bob's counteroffer is a step closer to my asking price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer,  trying to find a middle ground. 
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, but I want to explore the possibility of getting closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price point.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Strong language:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product and reiterates the desire for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Finality:** I'm  framing this offer as a potential closing point.  This adds pressure for Bob to respond positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,150,000, so I'll offer $1,075,000. Can we make a deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, his offer is still significantly below my desired $1,500,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could drag the process on and doesn't guarantee a better outcome. 
* **Secure alternative:** Selling to John ensures I receive my desired price without further risk or negotiation."
