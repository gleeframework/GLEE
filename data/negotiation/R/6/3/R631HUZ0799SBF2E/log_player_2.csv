"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget. You should reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $700,000 at this time.  This is my best offer, considering my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $700,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $900,000 is still above your target. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your budget with another counteroffer.  You can potentially reach a compromise closer to your target within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me closer to the middle.  I've tried to be flexible, but I have to be firm on my bottom line. To avoid wasting any more of your time, I'm willing to accept $875,000 for the product. This is my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within your budget and very close to your target price. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away and you'll be forced to buy from John at $800,000. It's better to secure the product now at a price that's favorable."
