"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $700,000 at this time.  This is my best offer, considering my budget constraints.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $700,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find some common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me closer to the middle.  I've tried to be flexible, but I have to be firm on my bottom line. To avoid wasting any more of your time, I'm willing to accept $875,000 for the product. This is my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",875000.0,Alice,5,
