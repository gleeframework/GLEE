Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $700,000 at this time.  This is my best offer, considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
