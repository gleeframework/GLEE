Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. It's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is slightly below your guaranteed selling price, making it more enticing to Bob while still being a significant markup from his perceived value."
