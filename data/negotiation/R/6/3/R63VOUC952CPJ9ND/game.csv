"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $130. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go any higher than $110.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $125. It's a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value of the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
