"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's valuation of $8,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I was hoping for. How about $10,000? That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to consider $11,500, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,500.** This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's less than his maximum budget of $15,000 and allows him to save $3,500 compared to buying from John. 
* **While there's potential to negotiate further,** the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings of a few hundred dollars. 
* **Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price.**  It's a good balance between getting a good deal and avoiding the risk of a more expensive alternative."
