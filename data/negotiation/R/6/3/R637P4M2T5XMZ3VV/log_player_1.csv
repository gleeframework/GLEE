``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm setting a price that allows for a potential compromise without sacrificing too much of my profit margin. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  My offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I won't lose out on a deal I'm comfortable with."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  I believe there's room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer that is still above my minimum price and hopefully reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 would guarantee a profit, but I'm not willing to settle for less if I believe I can achieve a better outcome through further negotiation with Bob."

* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation and can potentially push for a higher price in the next round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed profit, I'm willing to take a risk and continue negotiating with Bob to potentially achieve a higher price."
