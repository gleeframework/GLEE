Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.  Going too close to $1,200,000 might make him walk away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its long-term benefits."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,050,000 is a strong starting point, giving you room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting ""unique value"" and ""long-term benefits"" subtly justifies the price without explicitly revealing your other offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The message leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to potentially meet somewhere in the middle while still exceeding your minimum.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared to adjust your strategy and offers based on Bob's responses and willingness to engage."
