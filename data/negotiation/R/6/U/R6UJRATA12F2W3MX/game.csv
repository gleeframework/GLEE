"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,500, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000, as I believe this product is worth more. Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $11,500. Would that be possible?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit too low.  How about we compromise at $12,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate that.  How about we settle this right now at $12,250? That's my final offer.",12250.0,Bob,6,
