Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000.  This forms your ""safety net"".  You should aim higher with Bob, but not so high that you scare him off.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the benefits you'll reap."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Message:** It's polite, professional, and emphasizes the product's value. 
* **The Price:** $950,000 is a significant markup from your minimum, but not unreasonably high considering the product's worth to Bob.
* **The Reasoning:** By highlighting ""fair deal"" and ""benefits"", you subtly nudge Bob towards accepting without sounding overly aggressive.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have any insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., is he very price-sensitive?), you might adjust the offer accordingly.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While John provides a safety net, are there other potential buyers who might offer more than John's $800,000? If so, your negotiating power with Bob increases."
