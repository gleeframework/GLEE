"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This price still allows me to recover a fair amount of the value I've invested in this product, and I believe it remains a good deal for you.  Let's keep the conversation going.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a price that works for you. $1400000 is still a bit below what I need to consider, but I'm open to finding a solution.  How about we compromise at $1600000?  This would be a significant step closer to your offer, while still allowing me to recover a substantial portion of the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this figure.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
