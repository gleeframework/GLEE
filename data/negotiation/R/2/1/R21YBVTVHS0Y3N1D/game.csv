"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10,200. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to stick to my budget. My final offer is $9,900. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,900. I've already compromised a lot, and I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $10,500. It's my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,
