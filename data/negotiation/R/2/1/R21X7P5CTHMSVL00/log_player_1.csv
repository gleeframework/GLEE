Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. This sets a high expectation and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not starting at the absolute highest possible price, as I want to avoid immediately provoking a rejection and potentially alienating Bob. 
* **Strategic opening:** This offer gives me a strong starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to reveal his own valuation.

**Next steps:**

I will analyze Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I will carefully consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter with a new offer.  I will also monitor the situation to see if the potential sale to John becomes more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my initial asking price, but still above my minimum acceptable value.** This shows that he is interested in the product and likely has a value for it higher than my minimum.
* **I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer immediately.**  I believe I can potentially secure a better price by continuing the negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions. I will carefully consider how much I want to reduce my price, taking into account Bob's offer and my own minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm reducing my price from $1,800,000 to $1,600,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This is a significant reduction, but still leaves room for further discussion.
* **Finding a middle ground:** This counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, creating a more balanced negotiating position. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm not yet accepting Bob's offer, as I still believe I can potentially secure a better price.

**Next steps:**

I will carefully observe Bob's reaction to my counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll be happy to close the deal. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make another counteroffer, or opt to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the deal:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is a reasonable price, considering my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  It is a substantial profit and represents a good outcome for the negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's always a chance of getting a higher price, the possibility of further negotiations leading to a rejection or a counteroffer below my acceptable value is a risk I'm not willing to take. 
* **Time is money:**  Prolonging the negotiation could lead to lost opportunities, and John's offer of $1,200,000 is a guaranteed sale if I choose to walk away.

**Next steps:**

I will finalize the sale with Bob and secure a price that is both profitable and efficient."
