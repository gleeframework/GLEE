"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done some research and understand that it's worth $800000 to you. However, considering its value to me is at least $1500000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
