"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done some research and understand that it's worth $800000 to you. However, considering its value to me is at least $1500000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
