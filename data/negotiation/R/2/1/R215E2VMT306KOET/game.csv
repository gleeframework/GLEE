"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe this product will bring you a lot of benefits, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I can only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what I'm looking for, but still reasonable for you. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $11,000 is still quite a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could we possibly agree on something closer to $7,000? I believe that would be a fair price for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're committed to finding a solution, and I'm willing to increase my offer slightly. Would you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and I'm glad we're getting closer. However, $7,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,7,
