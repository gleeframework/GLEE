Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers a safety net of $1,000,000, the goal is to maximize profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, giving us room to negotiate above John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice (earning her $150,000 more than John's offer).

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, increasing the chances of a successful sale to Bob at a price that benefits Alice significantly."
