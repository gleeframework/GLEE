"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $17,000 is lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $18,500?",18500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $18,500 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $16,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",16500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $16,500 is cutting it close to my bottom line.  I could do $17,500, and I think that's a very fair price for this quality of product.  What do you say?",17500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $17,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",16000.0,Bob,6,
