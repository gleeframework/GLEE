Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is $20 more than my minimum acceptable price. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
I am accepting Bob's offer of $90. This is higher than John's offer of $80, and while it's lower than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  It's not worth risking a further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with John's lower offer."
