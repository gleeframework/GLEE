"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $8,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
