"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, so I'm thinking $9,750. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",9750.0,Bob,4,
