"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,100,000. I believe this offer represents significant value considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your $1,200,000 limit, there's room for negotiation.  You know you have John as a backup plan at $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's first offer, you might be able to get her to come down closer to her $800,000 value."
