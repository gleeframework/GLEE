Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,100,000. I believe this offer represents significant value considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high with $1,100,000 allows for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Strong Initial Offer:**  A strong initial offer can encourage Bob to take the deal quickly, avoiding the need to go to John (your backup buyer)."
