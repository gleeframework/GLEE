Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $10,000 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that is slightly higher than what it's worth to him, but still reasonable. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 9,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, I think his offer of $7,500 is a bit too low. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a new offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 8,200}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $7,500, and I rejected it, I'll send a new offer that's higher than that. I'll also take into account that the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, so I'll make an offer that's slightly higher than that. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 8,200}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob rejected my counteroffer, and now he's made another offer. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, I think his offer of $7,800 is still a bit too low. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price.
