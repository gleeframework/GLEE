"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and a steal at this price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate towards a price closer to your $120 limit, and it's unlikely Alice will go that low on the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($100), I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving space for Alice to counter-offer and for us to potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is phrased politely to maintain a positive tone and suggest that I'm still interested in the product. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential savings while keeping the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $120? That's still a great deal for a product worth so much more! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my maximum price. There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further, as I can buy the product from John for the same price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at my target price."
