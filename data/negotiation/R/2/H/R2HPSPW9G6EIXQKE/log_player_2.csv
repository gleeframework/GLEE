Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fantastic deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $11,250. This is a good price for both of us, and it's getting closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the best possible deal. Although $11,250 is closer to his ideal price point, he's willing to keep negotiating.  He's likely hoping to bring the price down further before the 10-round limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  Let's split the difference again. How about $10,875? This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting the sense we're both committed to making this work. How about $11,062.50?  That's right in the middle of our last two offers. I think this is a fair price that we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,062.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,062.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already made a significant number of counteroffers and is likely getting close to his limit of 10 rounds.  $11,062.50 is within his budget, and while he would prefer a lower price, it's getting closer to his ideal price point and a good deal compared to buying from John. It's a reasonable compromise and he can likely get a better deal with Alice than with John."
