"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet halfway? I propose $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering both our positions. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer to a workable figure, I can't accept anything less than $1,250,000. This product has significant value that I'm confident justifies this price. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
