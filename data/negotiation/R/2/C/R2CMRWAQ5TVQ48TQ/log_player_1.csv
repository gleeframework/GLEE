Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that amount as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $750,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $750,000. This is a relatively high offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate and meet me somewhere in the middle."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $700,000. Since this is lower than my initial offer, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.
