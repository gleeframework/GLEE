Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and allows me to gauge his interest. I'm also framing the message positively to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer allows me to avoid further negotiation and secures a sale without risking a lower price or a lost sale to John."
