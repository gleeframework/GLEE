"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find an agreement that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This recognizes the product's value while still providing you a significant gain.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise. It's closer to your offer, and still a good deal for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
