"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer that's closer to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) than mine ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation but ensures I don't undervalue the product.
* **Gauge Interest:** This first offer helps me understand how eager Bob is to buy. His response will give me a better sense of his negotiation strategy. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is better than John's $1,000,000, but it's still significantly below Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm looking for a price closer to the product's true worth. I'll aim for a counteroffer that splits the difference between his offer and my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find an agreement that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This recognizes the product's value while still providing you a significant gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By proposing $1,100,000, I'm aiming for a compromise. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still staying firm on a price above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits and profits he stands to gain.
* **Time Consideration:** We are in Round 3 of 10. While I have time,  I want to make progress towards a deal, and this offer keeps the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise. It's closer to your offer, and still a good deal for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a significant improvement. It's only $25,000 below my previous counteroffer and represents a substantial profit above my minimum.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, but his increments are getting smaller. Holding out for a higher price might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I could potentially push for more, continuing negotiations takes time and effort. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good deal and move on."
