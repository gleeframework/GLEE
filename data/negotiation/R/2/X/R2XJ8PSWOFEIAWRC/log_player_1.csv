Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product for $14,500 creates a sense of urgency (it's a limited-time deal better than my guaranteed offer) and potential savings for Bob while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** If Bob outright rejects this offer, there might be a small window to negotiate slightly down, but not below $15,000."
