{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  there's potential to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates urgency, potentially leading Bob to accept quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing potential profit."
