Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I can do $110, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge below $110. Her ""final offer"" and mention of ""other options"" suggest she's becoming less flexible.  At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price lower than John's $150 offer. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal."
