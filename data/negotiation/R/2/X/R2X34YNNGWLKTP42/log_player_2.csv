"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the market value is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice's offer of $900,000 is lower than John's $1,000,000 price. 
* **You save money:** Accepting Alice's offer means you save $100,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though Alice is trying to sell you the product for more than it's worth to her, it's still the best deal for you in this scenario."
