Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $14,500.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so any offer above that has the potential to be accepted.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $15,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, so there's no pressure to go below that.

**The Strategy:**  Start by offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer, while still ensuring a profit."
