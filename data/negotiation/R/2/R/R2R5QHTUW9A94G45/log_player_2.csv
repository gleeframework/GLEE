Alice is back to her original offer. It's tempting, but we've come too far to settle for that. We need to see if we can get her down a little further before resorting to buying from John."

Alice is raising her price, which means we're unlikely to get a better deal from her. We've already gone through 8 rounds of negotiation, and there's only one round left. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John for $1,200,000."
