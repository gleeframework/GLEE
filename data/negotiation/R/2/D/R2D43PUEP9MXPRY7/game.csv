"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $11,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's within your desired range and represents a significant savings for me. Let's see if we can make this deal work.",10000.0,Bob,4,
