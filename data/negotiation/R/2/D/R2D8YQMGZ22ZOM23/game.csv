"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you reaching out first.  While I'm interested, $150 is a bit outside my budget. How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $110 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $130? It's a fantastic product, and I'm sure you'll get a lot of use out of it.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I really appreciate you being flexible. I'm still aiming to stay under $120. Would you consider $115?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
