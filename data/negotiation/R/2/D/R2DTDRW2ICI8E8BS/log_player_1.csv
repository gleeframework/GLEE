Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it provides significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation or a quick sale at a price exceeding her minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $15,000 offer gives Bob the impression there might be room for negotiation if he's interested but finds the price a little steep. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Alice knows John will buy the product for $10,000. This provides a safety net, allowing her to confidently start high with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, it's a calculated risk Alice takes to potentially maximize her profit. She can always negotiate down or accept John's offer later."
