"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150 and Alice is offering the product for $150, accepting her offer is the best option. You're getting the product at your maximum price point, so there's no benefit to rejecting the offer or buying from John."
