"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to your target, but I'm not willing to give away too much profit. How about we meet at $102? It's still a good deal for both of us.",102.0,Alice,5,
