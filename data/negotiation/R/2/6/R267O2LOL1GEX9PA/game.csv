"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $1,200,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to this amount?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to meet you at $1,300,000. Could we perhaps aim for $1,250,000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still providing you with a fair profit.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me,  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I am still unable to meet you at $1,275,000. Could we possibly agree on $1,225,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
