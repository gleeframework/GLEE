"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $150 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $165. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my willingness to negotiate.  What do you say?",165.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $160 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",160.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $160 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $162.50. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",162.5,Alice,5,
