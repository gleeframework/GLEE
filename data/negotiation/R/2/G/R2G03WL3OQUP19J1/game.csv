"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm happy to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10500.  This is a fair price, as it's still a profit for you and it allows me to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10500 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10750. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,
