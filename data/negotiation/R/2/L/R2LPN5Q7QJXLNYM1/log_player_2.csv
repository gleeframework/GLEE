"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is way above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in your product but I'd need to get it for a much lower price to make it work for me. How about $12,000? I'm sure we can find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** A $6,000 drop from Alice's offer is a significant reduction, showing I'm serious about negotiating.
* **Focus on benefits:** I emphasize the mutual benefit of a deal.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** $12,000 is still above my max budget, allowing for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This price still reflects the significant value of the product, but it's a considerable compromise on my end. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $16,000, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating as I'm confident I can get a better price.  John's offer is always a safety net, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about buying your product, but I need to stay within a tighter budget. I'm prepared to offer $14,000.  This represents a significant step forward for me, and I hope we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the negotiation:** I'm showing Alice that I'm committed to finding a deal, but I'm not willing to go above my budget.
* **Reasonable offer:** A $2,000 decrease from Alice's last offer is significant, but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Focus on compromise:** I reiterate that I'm looking for a solution that works for both of us."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $15,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. However, the negotiation is progressing, and Alice seems willing to compromise.  I'm confident that I can push for a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and continue the negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm still committed to purchasing your product, but I need to stay within my budget.
