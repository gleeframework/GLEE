Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity with tremendous potential. I'm pricing it at $900,000, which is a significant discount considering its value to me. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering the product at $900,000. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the product's value and offering a discount to incentivize Bob. I'm also keeping the tone friendly and open to negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This offer sets a high starting point while allowing for potential compromise. It's important to be aware of the following:

* **John's offer:** I have a backup buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000. This gives me a strong bargaining position. 
* **Bob's perception:** $800,000 is Bob's perceived value.  He might be willing to pay more, but not significantly more.

By starting high and being willing to negotiate, I aim to secure a price as close to $1,000,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John's offer provides security:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum price.
* **Negotiation potential:** I can still negotiate with Bob, but I need to be strategic.

**Next Steps:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer to try and bridge the gap. I'll aim for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal.  Let me know if this is something you can work with."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price from $900,000 to $875,000.  This demonstrates flexibility while still staying above Bob's initial offer.
* **Value emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By offering a slightly lower price and emphasizing the product's value, I'm aiming to find a middle ground with Bob while maintaining a profitable deal.  I'm prepared to walk away if necessary, knowing that I have John as a secure backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price further? Perhaps to $825,000? I believe this would allow us to reach an agreement that suits both of our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $825,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price.
* **Limited negotiation potential:**  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price that meets my minimum requirements.

**Strategy:**

Given the circumstances, selling to John is the most profitable option. It guarantees me my desired price and eliminates further negotiation with Bob."
