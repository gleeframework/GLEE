Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I think I can still get closer to my desired price of $140."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $125 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  I'm willing to be flexible to make this work."", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $130 is a good compromise and it's better than selling to John for $120."
