"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $16500. This is my best counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and I can only go up to $15000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering it to you for $16000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,
