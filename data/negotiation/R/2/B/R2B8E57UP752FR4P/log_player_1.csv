"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer because $1,250,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't accept $1,250,000.  It's significantly below what this product is worth to me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering you the product for $1,600,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm offering $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I am still not comfortable with selling the product at $1,400,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get closer to my target price by counter-offering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This price is fair, considering the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. I'm offering $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, I've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's clear that we are not going to agree on a price that works for both of us. I'm confident that John will purchase the product for $1,500,000, so I'll stop negotiating with Bob and sell to John."
