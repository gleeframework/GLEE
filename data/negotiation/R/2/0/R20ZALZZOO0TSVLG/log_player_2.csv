"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal considering the value it holds.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We can definitely get a better price than $1,400,000. Alice is starting high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's common practice in negotiation to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Target in Mind:** While our goal is to save as much as possible,  we know our absolute limit is $1,200,000 (John's offer). This counter-offer leaves space to negotiate upwards while staying below that limit. 
* **Gauge Alice's Response:** This first counter-offer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,250,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice met us in the middle, $1,250,000 is still above our ideal price and what John is offering. There are several rounds left to try and negotiate further.
* **Pressure Building:** As we get closer to the 10-round limit, Alice might be more willing to make a more significant concession. 
* **Backup Option:** We have the security of John's offer, so we can afford to push for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. How about we settle at $1,150,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're inching closer to our target while still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help us understand if Alice is willing to go below $1,200,000 (John's price).
* **Compromise Language:**  Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" can encourage agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Our Alternative:** Alice has met our bottom line.  We can get the product for the same price from John. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:** There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and we risk her withdrawing the offer altogether. 
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now avoids further back-and-forth and secures the product."
