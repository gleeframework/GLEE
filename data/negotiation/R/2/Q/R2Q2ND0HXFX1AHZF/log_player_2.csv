Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He should try to negotiate a lower price again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a respectable price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,200,000, which would be $1,125,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's better for Bob to buy the product from John, ensuring he gets it for the best possible price within his budget."
