Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum price but still potentially attractive to Bob since the product is worth $150 to him. I'm hoping to get a good price without scaring him off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $150. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm countering with $165. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $155 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John would pay, and it's close to my initial goal. Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation."
