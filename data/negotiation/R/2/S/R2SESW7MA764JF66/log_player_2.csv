"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price. $125 is still above your limit, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $125 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to take it off your hands."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $110 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $115, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice has come down to $115, which is within my budget. It's still a good deal for me, so I'll accept the offer."
