"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to sell you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'll start with a price of $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what you're willing to pay, you can likely get a better deal.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However,  $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I still think my initial price of $100 is a fair one. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. This is the lowest I can go for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a better offer than Alice's previous one, it's still higher than what you're comfortable paying.  You're only willing to spend up to $120 and have already indicated that you're willing to pay $90. Continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still not quite there at $95.  Let's split the difference and go with $92.50.  This is a fair compromise and allows us to both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. I can do $97.50, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about other options, so let's see if we can finalize a deal today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $97.50 is still within your budget of $120. While you could continue negotiating, it's becoming riskier. You're nearing your limit of rounds, and Alice might be losing patience.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product and saves you some money compared to buying from John."
