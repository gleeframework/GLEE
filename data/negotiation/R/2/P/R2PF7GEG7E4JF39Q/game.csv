"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents the true value of this product, I understand your perspective.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $15,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Could you do $11,500? That would be great.",11500.0,Bob,4,
