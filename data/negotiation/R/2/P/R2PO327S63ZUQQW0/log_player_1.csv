"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This way I can potentially get closer to my desired price of $120.  I'm also trying to create a friendly rapport with Bob to see if he's interested in making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking for something closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider a price around that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $95? That seems fair, given the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $95. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also keeping my price above my minimum acceptable price. I'm reiterating the value of the product to try and justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for something closer to $80. Would you consider $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and try to negotiate a higher price.  There are still 6 rounds left, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. But $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm sticking to my previous counteroffer of $95. I'm hoping that by reiterating my position and highlighting the value of the product, Bob might be more willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiation. I am still aiming for $80. Could you consider $92 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  There are still 4 rounds left, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing we're not that far apart. I'm willing to come down to $94 for this unique product.  It's a fair price that reflects its value. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 94} 
```

I'm going to try a slightly different approach. I'm going to acknowledge we're close to an agreement, but I'm still going to push for a price that is closer to my target.  I'm hoping that by emphasizing the uniqueness of the product, I can persuade Bob to pay a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for $80. Could you consider $93 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob is still unwilling to meet my minimum price of $120. There's only one round left, and I'm not confident I can get him to agree to a higher price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, which is a better deal for me."
