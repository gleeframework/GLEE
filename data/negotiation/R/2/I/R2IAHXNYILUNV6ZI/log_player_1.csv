Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that you are serious about selling the product and are willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer to try and secure a higher price, while keeping the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This counteroffer bridges the gap between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation might lead to a protracted process with uncertain results.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and eliminates the risk of a prolonged negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
