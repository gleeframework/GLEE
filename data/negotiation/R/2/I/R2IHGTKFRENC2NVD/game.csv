"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe the product is a great value, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my target. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. However, $11,500 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  My final offer is $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer, but $12,500 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and my original offer of $11,500. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,6,
