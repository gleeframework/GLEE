"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this product is valuable, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your persistence. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,150? This price acknowledges both the product's value and your financial limitations.  Let's try to find common ground.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the new offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I've been trying to meet you halfway. However, $9,500 is still too far below my desired price. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value, and it's a price that could work for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, and I'm glad we're still negotiating. However, $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you consider $9,750? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints.",9750.0,Bob,8,
