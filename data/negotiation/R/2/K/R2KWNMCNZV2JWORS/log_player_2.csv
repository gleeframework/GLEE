Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $750,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $575,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you $620,000, which is a significant reduction from my original price. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your limit is $600,000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot on the price, and I need to make a profit. I'll offer you a final counteroffer of $610,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer.  While getting to $600,000 would have been ideal, the difference of $10,000 isn't significant enough to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting at $610,000 secures a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at the higher price."
