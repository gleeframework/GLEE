"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000, which is still a significant discount from what I could pay elsewhere.  Let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $650,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you.",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $650,000 is still a bit high. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $700,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential savings you'll get from closing the deal quickly. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $700,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you and the potential benefits of doing business together.",675000.0,Alice,5,
