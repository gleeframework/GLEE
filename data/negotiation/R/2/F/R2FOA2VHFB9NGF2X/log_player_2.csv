{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is close to your maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. In light of your proposal, I would like to suggest a price of $1,075,000 for the product. This allows us to both benefit from the transaction while maintaining a fair price. I look forward to your response.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but there's still some wiggle room. I'm willing to continue negotiating for a lower price, as I can still potentially save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However,  $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000, which I believe represents a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1060000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I understand your position and am willing to consider a price closer to your suggestion. Therefore, I propose a final price of $1,065,000 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise, allowing us to reach an agreement that benefits both parties. I hope you will find this offer acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,065,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $1,060,000.  While I'd prefer to save another $5,000, there's a good chance that further negotiation will lead to a stalemate or even result in Alice raising her price again.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the offer and secure the product for a price that is within my budget and significantly lower than John's price."
