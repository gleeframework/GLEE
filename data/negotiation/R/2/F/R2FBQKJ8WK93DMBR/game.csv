"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. Considering the value you placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $13500. This is the best I can do at this time. What are your thoughts?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're still looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $13250. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $13100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll offer it to you for $13300. This is my final concession. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",13300.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13200. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm starting to lose interest in continuing the negotiation.
