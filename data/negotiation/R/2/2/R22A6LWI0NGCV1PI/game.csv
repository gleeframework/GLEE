"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $8,200 is closer to what I had in mind.  How about we settle at $7,600?",7600.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable going below $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8100.0,Alice,5,
