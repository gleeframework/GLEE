"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $1500000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting close! I understand your position, but $1300000 is still a little low for me.  How about we settle at $1400000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
