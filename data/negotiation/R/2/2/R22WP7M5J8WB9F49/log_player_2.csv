```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still get the product for a lower price by continuing negotiations.  Buying from John immediately would cost him more than he is willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's a bit higher than he initially wanted, it's still within his budget and a better deal than buying from John.  He's also likely to get a lower price if he continues negotiations, but there's a risk Alice will walk away from the deal altogether.  It's best to secure the product at a reasonable price rather than risk losing the opportunity entirely."
