"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's worth $1,600,000. Let's start the conversation!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,600,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,550,000, which reflects a fair value for both of us.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired maximum of $1,500,000.  Since Bob has a backup option with John at that price, it's still advantageous to keep negotiating with Alice to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would ensure a smooth transaction and be fair to both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
