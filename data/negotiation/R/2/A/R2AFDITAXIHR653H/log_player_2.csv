"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than her valuation of the product ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000). There is plenty of room for negotiation. It's more advantageous to reject her offer and counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd be willing to consider a price of $950,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:** This counteroffer is a 21% reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating a strong willingness to negotiate.

* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and respectful tone is important for building rapport and encouraging a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, $1,100,000 is still a significant premium above her valuation and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting again, you signal a firm stance and encourage Alice to come down further. 
* **Opportunity for Compromise:** It's likely Alice is now more open to a deal closer to your preferred price point."
