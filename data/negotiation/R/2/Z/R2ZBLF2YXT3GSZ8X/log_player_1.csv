"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll really love! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try to get a higher price. I have 9 rounds left, and I think I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
I'm counteroffering at $90, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $85 as my offer for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $85 isn't ideal, it's close to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I can always try to sell to John if this deal falls through in later rounds."
