"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This allows for negotiation and gives me room to come down a bit if needed. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, it's best to start high and see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum value, I think I can still get more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,750.  This is a slight decrease from my initial offer and shows flexibility, but still keeps me above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,600. While it's still a bit lower than I hoped for, it's only $100 less than my last counteroffer.  It's getting close to my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate."
