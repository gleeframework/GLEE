"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you coming down to $10,500. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $9,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,100.  This is my final offer, so let me know what you think.",10100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,100. I'm willing to pay up to $9,900. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for this final round.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's the best offer you're going to get from me.  Think about it, and let me know your decision.",10000.0,Alice,7,
