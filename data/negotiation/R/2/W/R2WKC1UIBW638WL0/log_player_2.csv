"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its features and benefits, I believe a price of $22,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $22,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is my maximum budget for this item.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is a generous offer considering the product's quality and features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $19,000 is still higher than my maximum budget. While it's a reduction from her initial price, I can still try to negotiate further. There are rounds remaining, and I want to exhaust those before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $19,000 is still above what I can afford.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $15,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
