"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its features and benefits, I believe a price of $22,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong anchor price significantly higher than our minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of a higher potential value. 
* **Gauging Bob's Response:** This first offer is primarily to understand Bob's willingness to pay. His counter-offer will give us valuable information to adjust our strategy. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We keep John ($15,000 guaranteed sale) in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is my maximum budget for this item.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below our minimum of $15,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** We still have eight rounds left, providing ample time to negotiate. Bob's initial offer likely represents the lower end of his potential spending range.
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** By rejecting and countering, we can gradually work towards a mutually agreeable price.  We'll use a descending offer strategy while staying aware of John's offer as our safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is a generous offer considering the product's quality and features."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We acknowledge Bob's position while emphasizing the product's value. Our counter-offer is a significant drop from the initial price but still well above both our minimum and Bob's initial offer. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering $19,000, we establish a new anchor point, shifting the negotiation closer to our desired range.
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Power:**  We are still positioned to walk away from the deal and accept John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $19,000 is still above what I can afford.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $15,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Our Minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,000 matches our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. 
* **Securing a Sale:**  Accepting now guarantees the sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially stalling or Bob withdrawing his interest. 
* **Limited Upside:** While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is minimal compared to the risk of losing the sale altogether."
