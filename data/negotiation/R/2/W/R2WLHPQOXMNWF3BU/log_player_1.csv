Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $8,000, and this offer is well above that.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** This price isn't your ""final"" price, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer. 

By starting high, you maximize your potential profit. If Bob rejects, you can use his counteroffer to gauge his interest and adjust your next offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below what you're aiming for. By rejecting, you keep the negotiation going and show Bob that you're not desperate to sell at his price. This will give you leverage to potentially get closer to your desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $11,000? It's still a great price for the product, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still not ideal.  You want to maximize your profit. By rejecting Bob's offer again, you demonstrate you're serious about getting a price closer to your desired value. This increases your chances of reaching a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price for both of us. This allows me to make a profit while still offering you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is now offering $9,000, which is very close to your minimum of $8,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of further lowering the price and potentially ending up with a deal closer to $8,000 is too high. 

By selling to John for $8,000, you ensure a guaranteed sale at your minimum price. This is the safest option to secure a sale without risking further negotiation."
