I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
 
While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a profit margin. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

It seems Bob is firm on his price. While I could continue negotiating, it's clear that I won't be able to get closer to my desired price.  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, so I'll sell to him to avoid further negotiation."
