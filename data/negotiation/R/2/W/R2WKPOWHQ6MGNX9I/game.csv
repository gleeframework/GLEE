"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $950000. I hope this aligns better with what you're able to offer.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, and $950000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1025000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value you place on the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let me think about it for a moment. In light of our previous discussions and the value I see in the product, I would like to propose a price of $975000. I hope this proposal allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $975000 is getting closer but not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $990000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",990000.0,Alice,5,
