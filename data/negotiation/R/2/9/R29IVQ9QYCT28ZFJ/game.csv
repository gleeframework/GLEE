"Hi Alice, $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $75. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $75 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $85 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and go with $80?  That seems fair to both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
