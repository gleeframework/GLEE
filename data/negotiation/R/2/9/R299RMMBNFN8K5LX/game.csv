"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,200 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,800? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8800.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $8,300 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $8,500 to make this worthwhile. How about we settle on $8,600? It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8600.0,Alice,5,
