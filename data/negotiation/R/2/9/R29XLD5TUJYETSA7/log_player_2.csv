{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget, so it's worth exploring if he can get a better deal.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting by offering half of Alice's initial price, which is a significant reduction. This is a strong opening counteroffer that shows Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to make a substantial concession. This will give Alice some room to negotiate without feeling pressured into accepting a very low price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's, it's still worth exploring further negotiation. There's room for Alice to come down further, and Bob can potentially get the product for even less than $600,000. It's too early to commit to buying from John, as there's still potential to save more by continuing negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer, but it's not too aggressive, making it more likely for Alice to accept.  Bob is trying to find a middle ground that both parties might find agreeable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $650,000 is a reasonable compromise. While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much lower.  This price is still significantly cheaper than buying from John and allows Bob to secure the product without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
