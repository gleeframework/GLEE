Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value. This allows room for negotiation and leaves me with more potential profit.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I'm explicitly stating my willingness to discuss the price. This encourages Bob to make a counteroffer rather than simply rejecting the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  I mention that the product is ""unique"" and ""of great value"" to entice Bob and make him consider the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. The actual strategy will depend on how Bob reacts and how much information you can glean from the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's still interested in the product. This means there's potential for further negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay $10,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum value, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your offer. How about $12,000?  This reflects the unique value of this product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is a compromise that is still above my minimum value.
* **Value Emphasis:** I remind Bob of the ""unique value"" of the product to justify the higher price.
* **Fairness:**  I highlight the ""fair deal"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of compromise and  potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Important Note:** I'm using a counteroffer to try and bridge the gap between our prices. However, if Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to assess the situation and potentially sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique value, but $12000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $9,500 is very close to my minimum value of $10,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the potential gain is very small.
* **Risk of Lower Counteroffers:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that Bob will counteroffer with a lower price in the next round. 
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** John offers a guaranteed sale at $10,000. This is a safer and more profitable option compared to the risk of further negotiation.

**Conclusion:** Selling to John provides a secure and financially advantageous outcome, minimizing potential losses and maximizing profit."
