"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your offer. How about $12000?  This reflects the unique value of this product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,3,
