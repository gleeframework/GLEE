I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $8,000 and leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay this, as it's still less than the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500.  This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between his offer of $9,000 and my previous offer of $10,000. I believe this is a fair price that will be attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below my initial goal, it's a good price that is close to my minimum acceptable amount, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
