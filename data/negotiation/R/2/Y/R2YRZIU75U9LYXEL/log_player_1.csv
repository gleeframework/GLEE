"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also aware that I need to be flexible to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,000.  This is still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll see this as a good compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe I can still negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,800.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal.  I'm hoping he'll accept this final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price."
