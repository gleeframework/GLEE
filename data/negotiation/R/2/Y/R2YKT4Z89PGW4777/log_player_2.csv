"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price. He has room to lower the price further before reaching his maximum budget of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above Alice's minimum selling price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for further negotiation while ensuring Bob doesn't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,080,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than Bob's initial counteroffer but still above Alice's minimum price. This is a good deal for Bob, as it allows him to purchase the product for less than John's price while still giving Alice a fair profit.  Further negotiation might save a little more, but the risk of losing the deal to John is higher."
