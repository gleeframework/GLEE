"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering me for this product.  I'm really interested, but my budget is a bit tighter than $100.  How about we try $85?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $95. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $92.50. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm getting closer to my minimum price.",92.5,Alice,5,
