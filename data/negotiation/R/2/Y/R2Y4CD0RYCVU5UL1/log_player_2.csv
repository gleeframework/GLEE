You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer.  It's still above your maximum budget of $80.  You can counteroffer and try to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $95. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While $95 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You can try another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price of $80."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $92.50. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm getting closer to my minimum price.

You have three options:

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but she's still above your maximum budget of $80. At this point, it's better to go with John's offer and get the product for $80.  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's likely that Alice won't come down much further."
