Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6

**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to push for more, Bob has steadily increased his offer and is now at $1,350,000.  This is a significant profit above your minimum.  Continuing to negotiate risks him walking away or getting stuck in a stalemate.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob and having to settle for John's offer."
