"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the true value you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,800,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a strong starting point, I'm confident this product offers significant value beyond that for your specific needs. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $1,500,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to Bob's target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still only able to go up to $1,300,000. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be a bit firmer on this. The product's value is undeniable, and $1,450,000 is my final offer. I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a closer to Bob's target price, $1,450,000 is still above his maximum budget. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further. If she won't, Bob can always buy from John."
