,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the significant value this product holds for you, and it's a price that's fair for both of us. Let's find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $1,280,000.  It's a small step closer to your offer, and it still allows me to get a fair return on this valuable product.  Let's work towards a win-win scenario.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,280,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,260,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting close. How about $1,270,000?  This is a small step up from your last offer, and it's still well below the product's true value for you.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1270000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1,270,000 is still a bit too high. I'll offer $1,240,000, and I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",1240000.0,Bob,8,
