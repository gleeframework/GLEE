"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider  $11,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget constraints.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a way for us to make this work.  How about we finalize the deal at $9,500? It's a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",9500.0,Alice,7,
