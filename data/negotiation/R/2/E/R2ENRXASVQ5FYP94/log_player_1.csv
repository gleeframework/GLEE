Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is too low. It's clear we need to move closer to his valuation while still aiming for a good profit. Let's see if he's willing to negotiate further.

Round 4
