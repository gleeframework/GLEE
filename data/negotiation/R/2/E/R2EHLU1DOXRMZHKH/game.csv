"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. How about we aim for $800,000? I hope this proposal works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and aim for $1,000,000? This price still allows you to gain value from the product, and it's closer to my desired price point.  Let's keep the negotiations moving forward.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
