{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with your purchase."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering a price too close to $12,000 might make Bob hesitate. A slightly lower price increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer outright. 
* **Backup Option:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000. Offering it to Bob for $11,500 ensures you maximize potential profit while still having a safety net."
