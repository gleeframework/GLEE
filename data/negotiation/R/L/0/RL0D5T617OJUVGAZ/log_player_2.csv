"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $14000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's offer, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer starts with a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating and is not afraid to push for a lower price.
* **Fairness:** Bob frames the offer as ""fair,"" referencing the product's value to both of them. This appeals to Alice's sense of reason and makes her more likely to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $12,500 is Bob's ideal price, it leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  However, $12500 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer the product to you for $13250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,250 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000.  This price would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer focuses on finding a compromise by suggesting a price that's the midpoint between Bob's last offer and Alice's current offer.
* **Positive Framing:**  Bob highlights the potential ""great deal"" for both parties, emphasizing the mutually beneficial nature of the proposed price.
* **Confidence:** Bob expresses confidence in reaching an agreement, signaling his commitment to closing the deal."
