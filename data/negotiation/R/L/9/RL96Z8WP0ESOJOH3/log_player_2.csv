"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $100. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating.  The product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for a lower price that still benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $90?  This price is still a fair profit for you and a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. How about we agree on $95 for the product? This price allows for a reasonable profit while still being attractive to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $95, which is still a good deal for Bob.  It's only $5 more than his initial counteroffer, and it's significantly cheaper than buying from John.  There's a good chance Bob can't get a lower price by continuing to negotiate."
