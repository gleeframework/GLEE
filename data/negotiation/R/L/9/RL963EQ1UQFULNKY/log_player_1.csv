Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to make a slightly larger profit margin.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This still gives you a good return and leaves room for me to make a worthwhile investment. What do you think?
