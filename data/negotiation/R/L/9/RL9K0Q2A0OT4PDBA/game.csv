"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though! I'd like to counteroffer at $9500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer at $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $9000. I'm willing to make another concession, though! I'd like to counteroffer at $9200. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to pass up. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to counteroffer at $9050. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",9050.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid $9075 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, so I'd like to counteroffer at $9025.
