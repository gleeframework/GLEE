"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price given the value it offers.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm mentioning the value the product offers to Bob to try and make the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation.

This strategy aims to get a high initial price while also showing flexibility and leaving room for a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,200,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean a huge loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's willing to negotiate. This gives me an opportunity to potentially get a better price. 
* **Time to counter:** I'm choosing to reject the offer and counter in the next round. This will allow me to try and push the price closer to my minimum.

I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's still a chance I can get a better price from Bob through further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the value of the product while still being fair for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** I'm offering $1,400,000, which is closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000, but still lower than my initial offer.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and framing the price as a compromise.
* **Open to further discussion:** I'm using language like ""meet in the middle"" to imply flexibility and willingness to negotiate further.

By taking this approach, I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob while still maintaining a profitable price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation room:** We're getting closer to a potential agreement, and Bob seems motivated to negotiate.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially secure a better price in the next round.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm proposing $1,350,000.

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's directly in the middle between my last offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's current offer ($1,300,000). This demonstrates a genuine attempt to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this offer is a ""significant compromise"" to show that I'm taking his position seriously.
* **Maintaining value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to finalization:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm encouraging Bob to consider this offer as a potential final price.

* **Maintain leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and hopefully push the price up a little higher in the next round.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we settle on $1,340,000?  This is a very small adjustment from my previous offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  It's time to finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1340000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small adjustment:** I'm proposing a very small increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest proposal. I've carefully considered your offer and would like to counter with an offer of $1,330,000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're in round 8, leaving only two rounds left before I have to make a decision.
* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer is only $10,000 away from my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject, there's a risk that Bob might not be willing to go higher, or we might not reach a deal before the time limit.

Considering the time constraint and the fact that selling to John would guarantee my minimum, it's safer and more practical to sell the product to John. This avoids the risk of further negotiation and ensures I achieve my minimum target price."
