Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I won't sell for less than $15,000 because that's my minimum value.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay up to $8,000.
* **Negotiation space:**  I need to find a price within this range.
* **John's offer:**  I know John will pay $15,000, which gives me a safety net.
* **My offer:** I'm offering $12,000, which is a significant discount for Bob, but still leaves me with a profit.  

**Why this strategy is good:**

* **Attractive to Bob:** $12,000 is a good deal for Bob, giving him a $4,000 profit.
* **Good profit for me:** It's a $3,000 profit for me, which is better than selling to John.
* **Minimizes risk:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $15,000. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while ensuring a sale."
