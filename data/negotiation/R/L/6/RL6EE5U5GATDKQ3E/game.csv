"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a little high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you given the product's value. Let's find a middle ground! ",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $11,500. Would that be workable for you?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $11,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
