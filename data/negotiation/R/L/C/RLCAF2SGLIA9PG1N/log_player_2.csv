"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $150 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, there's no reason to engage in negotiations with Alice.  You can get the product immediately from John and save yourself the potential time and effort of haggling."
