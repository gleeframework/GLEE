"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This aligns more closely with my assessment of the product's worth.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the product's value. However,  $950,000 falls short of what I believe is fair given its potential and the unique benefits it offers.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to accept $1,050,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
