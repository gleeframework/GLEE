"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Let's meet somewhere in the middle.  How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $950,000 is still too low. How about we settle at $1,050,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
