Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure I can meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair midpoint between our previous offers. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

We're still significantly above John's offer, and I believe Bob is willing to go higher. Let's keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a price we both feel comfortable with. While I'm aiming for a higher number, I'm willing to come down to $1,010,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your investment."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,010,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $980,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could continue negotiating, Bob has consistently moved upwards in his offers, and $980,000 is a strong profit. It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and I risk pushing him away by continuing to negotiate. Accepting this offer secures a great deal."
