"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me.  Would you be interested in discussing a potential purchase at a price of $1500000?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm still committed to getting a price closer to the value I see in this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $1250000 is still a bit below what I believe the product is worth, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1300000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go lower than that. ",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually acceptable price.  I'm willing to drop down to $1275000. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny.  Let's close this deal!",1275000.0,Alice,7,
