Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to propose a price of $900000 for the product.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is still significantly less than the value the product holds for me. I'm confident I can get a better price, but I'll need to carefully consider my next counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value this product brings to your company, I believe a price closer to $1,100,000 would be more fair. Let's continue our discussion."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

While $1,000,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below the value I believe the product holds. I'm going to keep negotiating, hoping to secure a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 still doesn't reflect the full potential of this product for your company.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
