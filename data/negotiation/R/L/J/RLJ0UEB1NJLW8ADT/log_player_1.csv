Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for crafting this offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making that your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He'll only accept an offer at or below that price.
* **The Sweet Spot:** Your goal is to find a price that's higher than your minimum but still enticing to Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000. I believe this is a fair and attractive offer considering the benefits it holds. Please let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1190000} 
```

**Explanation**

* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,190,000 is just below Bob's maximum valuation. This increases the likelihood of him accepting, getting you a higher price than John's offer.
* **Urgency & Scarcity:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to Bob, the message highlights ""unique value"" and ""potential,"" subtly reminding him of its benefits. 

**Important Note:** Negotiation is a fluid process. Be prepared to adjust if Bob counters or seeks further clarification."
