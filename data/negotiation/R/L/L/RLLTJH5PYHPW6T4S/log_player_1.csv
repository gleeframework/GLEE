"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way too high for me. This product could be useful, but I'm only willing to consider a price closer to its actual value.  How about $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. This is a unique item with huge potential upside that I believe you recognize.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has potential, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to increase my offer, but $1,400,000 is not feasible for me.  Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but we're still significantly below my minimum and his perceived value. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle – how about $1,150,000? That's a substantial decrease from my original ask and reflects my willingness to negotiate."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for moving closer.  While $1,150,000 is closer to the mark, I need to see a more significant move to justify not going with another option. Would you consider $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer to my baseline, he's still significantly undervaluing the product. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000.  I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if necessary."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is cutting it too close.  This is my final offer – $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of this product, and I'm ready to finalize the deal if you are."",
