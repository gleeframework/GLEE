"Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable and could be a game-changer for you. I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000.  I'm confident it's worth far more than that in the long run, given its potential.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way too high for me. This product could be useful, but I'm only willing to consider a price closer to its actual value.  How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. This is a unique item with huge potential upside that I believe you recognize.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has potential, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to increase my offer, but $1,400,000 is not feasible for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle – how about $1,150,000? That's a substantial decrease from my original ask and reflects my willingness to negotiate.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for moving closer.  While $1,150,000 is closer to the mark, I need to see a more significant move to justify not going with another option. Would you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is cutting it too close.  This is my final offer – $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of this product, and I'm ready to finalize the deal if you are.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
