"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,750?  That's closer to my target and still a fair price for the product.",10750.0,Bob,4,
