{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves some room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value Bob sees in the product, which can help build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you see in the product.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely. I'll accept his offer to secure the sale."
