{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is a significant amount, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I want to explore that before resorting to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to settle yet. I've made concessions, but I'm determined to secure a better price, especially with only 4 rounds remaining. There's still a chance Bob might come closer to my target."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm making a final push with this offer. It's just slightly above John's price, and I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to accept.  With only 3 rounds remaining, I want to see if we can reach a deal before I have to consider selling to John."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at John's price. Since there are only two rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal by rejecting and counter-offering. It's better to secure the deal at this point."
