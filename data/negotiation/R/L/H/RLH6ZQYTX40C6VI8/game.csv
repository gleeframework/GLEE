"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, recognizing your interest in the product.  This price still reflects its value, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,150,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I can accept. Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000.  This offer reflects a fair compromise, and it leaves us both with a positive outcome.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your desire to split the difference, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,180,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,180,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - $1,215,000.  This is a fair compromise considering our previous offers.  We're getting close to a deal, let's make it happen.",1215000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,215,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my maximum budget. I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  To reach an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering our previous offers, and it allows us to close this deal without either of us having to make any further concessions.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,9,
