"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $20,000 for the product.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, as that's the maximum value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $8,000.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering $12,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise. However, $12,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $8,000.  I understand the product holds value for you, but this is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,6,
