"Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position, but after evaluating our costs and margins, we are unable to accept $800,000 for the product. We propose a counteroffer of $975,000. This still represents a significant discount from the product's value to you, while ensuring a reasonable profit margin for us.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate the effort to find a compromise.  However,  $975,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
