(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$650,000 is a good deal, but it's likely that Alice is willing to go lower.  By rejecting the offer, I can try to negotiate a better price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to show Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. I'm hoping that she'll be willing to negotiate and meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is still a good price, I'm not ready to commit yet.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get the price down further. I'm going to reject this offer and see if Alice is willing to come down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $550,000.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm to my desire for a lower price.  I believe this offer is reasonable, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $575,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $575,000 is a reasonable price. While I'd love to get it even lower, I'm confident that I'm getting a good deal. Further negotiation could take time and might risk losing the deal altogether. It's time to secure the product at this price."
