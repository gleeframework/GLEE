"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me, though.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
