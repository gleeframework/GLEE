Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me, though.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

While Bob is getting closer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price. John offers a sure $1,000,000 which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
