"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth exactly that to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000 and John is also selling the product for $15,000, you have no incentive to accept Alice's offer. You can get the product for the same price from John."
