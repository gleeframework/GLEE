"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,200,000. Considering the product's value is worth $1,500,000 to you, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and my budget. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, the price of $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your desired price. However, $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the product's worth to you and my financial constraints. What do you think?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
