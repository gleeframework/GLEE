Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,200,000. Considering the product's value is worth $1,500,000 to you, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and my budget. What are your thoughts?
