"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's initial offer is too high ($180) for Bob's budget.  It's worth rejecting and attempting to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer that is still above his maximum budget. This allows room for negotiation while testing Alice's willingness to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to my original asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $165? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  He should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $165 is still a little high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $140.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing his interest and willingness to negotiate, but staying within his maximum budget. This creates a space for compromise without pushing him too far out of his price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $140 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150 final offer.  This is my absolute lowest price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $150 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  While he could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice will stick to her $150 price, leaving Bob with no room to bargain further. Buying from John at $120 guarantees the best price within Bob's budget."
