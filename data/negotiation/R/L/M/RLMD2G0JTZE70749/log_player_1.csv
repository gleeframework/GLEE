Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $8,500 is still too low.  I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to keep negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $9,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $9,250.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 9250}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,200 is getting too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can reach a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find common ground. I'm willing to go down to $8,800, but that's my absolute bottom line. This is a very valuable product, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to move on to other potential buyers. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 8800}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob is clearly not willing to pay a fair price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's not ideal, but it's still better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
