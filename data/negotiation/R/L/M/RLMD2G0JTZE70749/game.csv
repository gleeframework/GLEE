"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $9000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $9250.  This is my final offer.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find common ground. I'm willing to go down to $8800, but that's my absolute bottom line. This is a very valuable product, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to move on to other potential buyers. Let me know your decision.",8800.0,Alice,5,
