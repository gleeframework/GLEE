"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique and lucrative investment opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value in this product, $950,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the potential of the product. Let's try to close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll offer it to you for $887,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $887,500 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $870,000. This represents a significant move towards your last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",870000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",885000.0,Alice,7,
