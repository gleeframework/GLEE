Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000. It's a valuable asset that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this price is fair. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750000 is unfortunately too far below my value for the product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $850000. This reflects a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is closer to Bob's target of $800,000. However, it's still above that price. There's room for further negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $820,000, which is a fair middle ground. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 820000}
