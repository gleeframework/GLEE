Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this price is fair. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price. While $750,000 is a good amount, I can potentially get closer to my target value with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is unfortunately too far below my value for the product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $820000, which is a fair middle ground. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $820,000 is a good deal for me. It's close to my minimum value of $800,000, and I'm satisfied with this outcome. Selling to John would get me the same amount, but I've managed to secure a slightly higher price through negotiation."
