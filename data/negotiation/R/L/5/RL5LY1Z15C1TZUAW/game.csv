"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,550,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
