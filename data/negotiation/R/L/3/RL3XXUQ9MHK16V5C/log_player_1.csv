{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

I've reached the point where I'm no longer confident I can get a better deal with Bob.  He's consistently trying to negotiate down, and we're only $150 apart.  I'm not willing to risk losing more time and potentially the entire deal. It's time to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $12,000."
