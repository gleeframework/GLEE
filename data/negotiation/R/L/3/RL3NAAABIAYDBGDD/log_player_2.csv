"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special offer considering its value to you is $12,000. I believe this price reflects the quality and benefits of the product while leaving room for you to see significant value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John. There's room for bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500?"", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation. This tactic aims to see how flexible Alice is willing to be.
* **Not Insultingly Low:**  Offering $10,500 is still a reasonable starting point. It's more than 70% of Alice's initial asking price and acknowledges there's value in the product. 
* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintaining a positive tone is crucial for a successful negotiation. I want to show Alice I'm serious about the purchase while aiming for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In order to make this deal more appealing, I would like to propose an offer of $11,500 for the product. This price still allows us to cover our costs and provides some margin, while also being more accessible to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, we're getting close to John's price, and there's still room to negotiate with Alice. It's worth another counter-offer to see if we can get closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** Offering $11,000 is a clear and fair compromise. It shows Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price while still aiming for a significant saving.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying I'm willing to ""meet halfway,"" I imply this is my final offer, encouraging a quicker decision from Alice.
* **Positive Language:**  The tone remains positive and collaborative. I want to maintain a good relationship with Alice in case this deal goes through."
