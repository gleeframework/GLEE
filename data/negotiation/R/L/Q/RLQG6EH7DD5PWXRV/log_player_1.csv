{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. However, I'm open to discussing the price further. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000. Starting with an offer slightly below her guaranteed price allows room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification and Openness:**  By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" Alice provides a reason for the high price without explicitly revealing her bottom line. Expressing openness to discussion encourages Bob to engage and potentially counter-offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer leaves room for Alice to negotiate down slightly if needed while still securing a significant profit beyond Bob's perceived value and her guaranteed sale price."
