"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's strategically advantageous to begin with an offer significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and even my own minimum ($1,500,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial offer makes it clear I'm willing to negotiate, fostering goodwill and encouraging Bob to engage in the process.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights the ""unique value"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price without revealing my own valuation.

This approach aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** Ideally, Bob agrees to a price closer to my initial offer.
2. **Gather Information:**  Bob's reaction will provide valuable insights into his willingness to pay, guiding my strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking for something closer to $800,000. I believe we can find a middle ground. How about $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While his willingness to negotiate is positive, accepting this offer would result in a substantial financial loss. I am confident that I can negotiate a better deal, even if it means leveraging the offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 falls significantly short of the product's true value. To move this forward, I can offer it for $1,900,000.  This reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I'm making a substantial concession from my initial price ($2,200,000 to $1,900,000). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to find common ground. 
* **Holding Firm Above Minimum:**  The new offer is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), preserving my potential profit margin.
* **Justification:**  The message reiterates the product's value, justifying the high price point without directly referencing John's offer.

This approach aims to:

1.  **Encourage Continued Negotiation:** The significant price reduction incentivizes Bob to continue engaging in the negotiation process.
2.  **Maintain a Strong Position:**  By holding firm above my minimum, I signal the seriousness of my valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Could we meet somewhere around $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I'm willing to push the negotiation a bit further to see if I can bridge the gap before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to see a bit more movement to make this worthwhile for both of us.  How about we settle on $1,650,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's previous offer ($1,300,000) and my last counteroffer ($1,900,000). This signals a strong willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** The message highlights that this offer is a ""significant compromise"" to incentivize Bob to accept. It also subtly reminds him that I'm making concessions.
* **Time Constraint (Implied):**  As we progress through the rounds, the time constraint becomes more significant. This offer aims to close the deal quickly, maximizing my return and mitigating the risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the compromise. I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000, which is closer to the value you're offering and within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that the negotiations will drag on. Accepting this offer guarantees a satisfactory profit and a quick close to the deal."
