"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.  This shows I'm serious about selling to him but also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my target value by continuing to negotiate. I have 8 rounds left and can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,300,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to meet Bob halfway, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's willingness to come up in price before considering a sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm only halfway through the rounds. Accepting his offer ensures a good profit and secures the deal."
