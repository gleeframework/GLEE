Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This price gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage in a conversation.
* **Plan B:** I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me a safety net and leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the pressure on him to meet a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is still an option:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is still on the table if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need something closer to $12,000 to make this work. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $12,000 is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  My message emphasizes finding a ""middle ground"" that is fair to both of us. 
* **Still above minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it shows flexibility.
* **Keeping John as a backup:** I'm still holding John as a backup buyer, but I'm making a genuine attempt to reach a deal with Bob."
