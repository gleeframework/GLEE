"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to consider a price of $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $125? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to make the deal.",125.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $125. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $122.50?",122.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still hesitant to go below $125. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to hold firm on this price. How about we meet at $124? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to make the deal.",124.0,Alice,7,
