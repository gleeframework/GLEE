"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation and still provides a good profit margin. I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still a significant amount lower than my initial offer. I'm going to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm still confident that I can secure a better price than $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a reasonable profit margin. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still holding out for a little more. I'm going to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $11,000. I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $10,900. This shows Bob that I'm serious about wanting to make a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for much less than my initial offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to sway Bob and secure a sale in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not convinced. I think I can get a better offer, so I'll reject this one and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm still confident that I can get closer to my initial price of $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10850}
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,850, getting very close to Bob's last offer. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling and willing to make a compromise, while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the end of my negotiation with Bob, and it's clear that we're not going to agree on a price that works for both of us. With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time. Rather than risk getting a worse offer from Bob or losing out entirely, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. This is still a decent profit, and I'm better off securing a sale than continuing a negotiation that is unlikely to be successful."
