"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($10,000) and John's offer ($10,000). It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I have a more limited budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable negotiation range. This strategy aims to: 

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A significant counteroffer helps us understand how willing Alice is to negotiate.
* **Leave room for compromise:** Even if Alice rejects this initial counteroffer, it allows space for us to gradually increase our offer while staying well below our $10,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice came down in price, but it's still above both your $10,000 limit and John's offer.  There's room for further negotiation. We'll continue to counteroffer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $9,000? I'm a serious buyer and ready to close the deal if we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Moving closer to our limit:** We're raising our offer to $9,000, signaling our interest while still staying below our $10,000 maximum.
* **Balancing firmness and willingness:**  We acknowledge Alice's compromise but remain firm about our budget limitations. This shows we're serious but not desperate.
* **Adding a sense of urgency:** By mentioning our readiness to close the deal, we encourage Alice to consider our offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $11,000, which is still above your maximum budget and John's offer.  At this point, it's in your best interest to cut your losses and secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $10,000."
