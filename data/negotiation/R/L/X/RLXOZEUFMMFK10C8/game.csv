"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that's a little higher than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to balance that with the value I need to get for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000. Can we discuss the details?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for me. I can do $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
