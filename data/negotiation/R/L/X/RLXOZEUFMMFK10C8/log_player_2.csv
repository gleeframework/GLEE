Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to balance that with the value I need to get for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000. Can we discuss the details?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for me. I can do $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it.

Alice seems to be moving in the wrong direction.  Her price went up! It's unlikely she'll come down to a reasonable price, and it's not worth risking exceeding the $1,200,000 limit."
