"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate it, but $130 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $107.50?  I'm open to discussing this further if you're still interested.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find a compromise there.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  Let's try $100.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's closer to your offer.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $100 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to pay $97.50 for it. That's a fair price for both of us, and hopefully, we can close the deal.",97.5,Bob,6,
