"Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $950,000. It's a significant value proposition for you, given its worth to you. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's discuss.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This is still a very competitive price considering the value you'll receive. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I still think that's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the substantial value this product brings to you, I'm proposing $890,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close this deal. Let's finalize it.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $890,000. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but no higher. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, $880,000 still doesn't quite reach the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise a bit further and propose $885,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",885000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $885,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I'm starting to think that this product might not be worth the hassle, and I'm considering buying it from John for $1,000,000.",875000.0,Bob,8,
