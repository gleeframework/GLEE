Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm willing to let it go for $95. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John will buy the product for $100, Alice wants to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 is a good balance. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80) but still a potential bargain compared to him missing out and you selling it for $100 to John. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  The message hints at scarcity and a potential missed opportunity if Bob doesn't act, making him more likely to accept the offer."
