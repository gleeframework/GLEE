"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $9,000? This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's closer to your desired price and still within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is a fair price for both of us and a great opportunity for you to own a product that's worth $10,000 to you.  Let's close this deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,
