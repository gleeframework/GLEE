"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $8,000.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $9,000? This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's closer to your desired price and still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price and I think there's room for a little more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is a fair price for both of us and a great opportunity for you to own a product that's worth $10,000 to you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal without further negotiation. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my desired value and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm also running out of rounds, and I don't want to sell to John for a lower price."
