"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its worth to you.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you and I value it at $1,500,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for this product. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let's try to find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that lets us both walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000. This is a fair price that's still above my minimum, and it allows us to both benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
