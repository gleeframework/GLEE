Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its worth to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you and I value it at $1,500,000.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 9 rounds left and I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for this product. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that lets us both walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can do better. I have 6 rounds left and I can always sell to John for $1,000,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, hoping to bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000. This is a fair price that's still above my minimum, and it allows us to both benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1280000}
