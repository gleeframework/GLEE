"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $155? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $130? That's a fair compromise in my book.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we meet at $142? It's a good compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",142.0,Alice,5,

It seems like we are getting closer to a deal. How about we split the difference and settle on $136?,136.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $142 and $136, which would be $139. What do you think?",139.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to budge a little more. How about $137? This is my final offer.",137.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $137 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $140? It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",140.0,Alice,9,
