Alice's offer: The product price will be $998,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $998,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, it's only $18,000 over his limit.  This is a very small difference, and with only one round left, it makes sense to accept the offer.  It's unlikely Bob will get a significantly better price in the final round, and he's close to his desired price point. Buying from John at this point would save him a bit of money, but it's not a significant enough difference to justify potentially losing the deal with Alice."
