"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $10,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
