Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested.

While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm going to buy from John for $10,000."
