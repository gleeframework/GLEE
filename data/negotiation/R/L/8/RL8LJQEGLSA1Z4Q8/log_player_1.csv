{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and increase the chances of a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $85. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is more than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I can't go above $87 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer of $87 is still below my minimum desired price of $80, it's significantly higher than selling to John.  This is a good compromise and I'll accept Bob's offer."
