"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. I believe it's a good compromise between the value I see in the product and my budget. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. While $800000 is a significant amount, it unfortunately doesn't reflect the true value of this unique opportunity. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1200000. This represents a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a price you'll find compelling. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
