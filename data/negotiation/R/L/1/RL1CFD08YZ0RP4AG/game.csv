"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $650,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $725,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I think it would be a fair deal for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad to see you're serious about getting a good deal. However, $725,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $800,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
