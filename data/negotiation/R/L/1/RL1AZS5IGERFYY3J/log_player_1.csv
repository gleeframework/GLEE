Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $105. This is a compromise that moves closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this price is reasonable and could lead to a successful agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still too low.  I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I will sell to John to ensure I get the best possible value for my product."
