"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $18,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  Would you be willing to consider $19,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $19,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $18,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. What do you think?",18500.0,Bob,4,
