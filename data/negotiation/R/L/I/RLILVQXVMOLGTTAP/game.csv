"Alice,  $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $12,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $20,000 is already a significant discount on my end. How about we meet halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
