Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

This is a good time to accept the offer.  Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and $1,050,000 is a reasonable price, saving you $450,000 off John's offer."
