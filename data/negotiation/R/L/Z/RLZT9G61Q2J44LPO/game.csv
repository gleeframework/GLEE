"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I see the value in your product, $120 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $90? I'm very interested in the product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable purchasing from John for $100 if we can't reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to pay $105, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll sell it to you for $107.50.",107.5,Alice,5,
