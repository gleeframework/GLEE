"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, considering the market value is $15,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Motivation:** Alice knows the product's market value to you is $15,000. She's trying to anchor your perception of the price at that level.
* **Your Leverage:** You have an alternative seller (John) at $15,000.  This means you can aim for a price lower than $13,000.
* **Negotiation Tactic:** By rejecting Alice's first offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. She might be willing to lower her price to keep the sale."
