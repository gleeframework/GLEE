Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high point, leveraging the fact that the product is worth more to Bob.  It leaves room for negotiation, while still being significantly more than what I'd get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I will counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer more, it's the same amount I would get from John.  I will accept Bob's offer and avoid further negotiations."
