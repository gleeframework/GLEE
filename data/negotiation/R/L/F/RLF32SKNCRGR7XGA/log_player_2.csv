"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $10,500.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most advantageous option at this point."
