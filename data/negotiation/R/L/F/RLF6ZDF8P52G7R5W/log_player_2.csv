"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, you can likely do better.  You're willing to pay up to $150, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $150. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $100.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still a good deal for you.  You're willing to pay up to $150, so saving $40 is a significant discount.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your next offer and you'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to secure the product at a favorable price."
