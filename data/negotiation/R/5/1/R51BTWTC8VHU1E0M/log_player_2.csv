Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $850,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to negotiate, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $825,000 is still a bit too low. How about we meet at $825,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal? I'll include a 6-month warranty and a free maintenance package. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly motivated to sell and is making concessions. However, the price is still significantly above her value ($800,000). 
* We have time to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $800,000, even if it means going slightly above to secure the deal. 
* The added extras are a bonus, but it's important not to let them inflate the perceived value of the product too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer and the added incentives. However, my budget is firm, and I can't go higher than $780,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, considering the market value and my own financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 780000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $820,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'll throw in the 6-month warranty and maintenance package, and I'll also include a 10% discount on the purchase price. How about we meet at $820,000, and I'll give you an unbeatable deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** We are approaching the end of the negotiation window with only a few rounds remaining.
* **Competitive Offer:** Alice's offer of $820,000, while still above her value, is now getting closer to a reasonable compromise.  
* **Added Value:** The 6-month warranty, maintenance package, and especially the 10% discount make this offer much more appealing. The discount alone brings the price down to $738,000, which is a significant saving.

Holding out for a slightly lower price at this stage might backfire, risking the deal altogether. Accepting this offer secures a significant discount from the initial offer and Alice's perceived value, making it a strategically sound decision."
