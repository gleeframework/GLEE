Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have room to start higher with Bob. This leaves space for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it. 
* **Open Communication:**  Asking for Bob's thoughts encourages a dialogue and potential negotiation, increasing the chance of a sale above your minimum.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he completely rejects the $15,000, you can gradually decrease your asking price until you reach an agreement or decide to go with John's offer."
