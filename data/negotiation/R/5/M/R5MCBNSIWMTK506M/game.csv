"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. This is my best price for now, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to settle around $750,000. Would that be possible?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit above $750,000 in my valuation. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000, so I'll offer it to you for $787,500. This is my final compromise.",787500.0,Alice,5,
