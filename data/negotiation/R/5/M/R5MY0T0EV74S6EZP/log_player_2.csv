"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer of $100 is higher than both her valuation ($80) and John's price ($120). There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $70, I'm aiming significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is polite and expresses continued interest, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $70 puts me in a stronger position for future rounds. Even if Alice rejects this offer, it gives me a baseline to negotiate upwards from."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but $90 is still more than both her valuation and John's price. We can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That feels like a fair price."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This offer splits the difference between my previous offer ($70) and Alice's current offer ($90). It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Targeting Alice's Valuation:**  Offering $80 matches Alice's estimated valuation of the product. While she might not accept it immediately, it's a strong position to negotiate from as it's a price she should theoretically be happy with. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** With each round, we're getting closer to my alternative option of buying from John. Offering $80 maintains pressure on Alice to make a decision before I potentially walk away."
