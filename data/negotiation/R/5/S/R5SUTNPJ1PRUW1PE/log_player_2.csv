"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price. There are 9 more rounds, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a bold approach here, offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a risky move, as Alice could easily reject the offer. However,  it demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and establishes a starting point for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is truly significant. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,300,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price. Since there are 7 rounds remaining, Bob should continue negotiating. It is worth trying to get a better deal.  While there's a risk that Alice might not budge further, it's worthwhile to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,250,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is  proposing a price slightly higher than his previous counteroffer. This demonstrates that he is willing to compromise, but is still holding firm on his desire to get a good price.  He is also highlighting the urgency of closing the deal, hoping to convince Alice to accept his offer."
