,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $110 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price, and it gives you a great deal on a product you're interested in.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a little high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go higher than $100.  If you're willing to meet me at that price, we can make a deal. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,
