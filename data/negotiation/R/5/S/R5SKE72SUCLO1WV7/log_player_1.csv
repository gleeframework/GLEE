Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I can lower the price slightly, but I won't go below $100. I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $120 if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $110 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price, and it gives you a great deal on a product you're interested in.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $105 is still a little high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go higher than $100.  If you're willing to meet me at that price, we can make a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer $105, Bob's offer of $100 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $100. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd rather sell it to Bob now than risk losing him and having to sell to John for $120."
