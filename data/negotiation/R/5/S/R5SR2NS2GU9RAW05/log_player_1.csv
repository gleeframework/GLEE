Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is aggressive, leaving Bob with a significant profit margin while still netting me a very substantial amount. I'm confident Bob will be incentivized to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away and secure the $1,000,000 from John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $1,200,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a good profit margin for myself. This counteroffer should keep the negotiation going while demonstrating my willingness to compromise."
