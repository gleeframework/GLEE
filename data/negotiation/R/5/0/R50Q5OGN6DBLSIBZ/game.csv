"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm a bit of a budget-conscious buyer, and I'd love to make a deal with you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to the price I'm willing to pay, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,250 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a bit more. Would you be willing to go to $10,400? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would help me meet my needs. Let me know what you think!",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $10,400. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the price I've been considering from John. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'd like to make a deal with you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
