"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm a bit of a budget-conscious buyer, and I'd love to make a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm willing to pay, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I still want to see if I can push for a bit more. $10,250 is still lower than my valuation of the product, and I think I can get a slightly better deal. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,250 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a bit more. Would you be willing to go to $10,400? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would help me meet my needs. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $10,400. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the price I've been considering from John. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'd like to make a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is just below my minimum threshold, and I've already gone back and forth with him a few times.  It's time to move on. John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
