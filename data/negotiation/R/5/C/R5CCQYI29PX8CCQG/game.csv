"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far from reaching my target. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you a price of $10,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $10,200, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10200.0,Alice,7,
