Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

While I'd be happy to get $1,500,000,  I'm aiming for more. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer.  This keeps the negotiation going, and hopefully, I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}

I'm lowering my offer to $1,800,000. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, Bob will find it more appealing than his initial offer of $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has moved up from his initial offer to $1,600,000. This is a good price for me, considering the value of the product and the potential of John's offer.  It's worth accepting this offer and finalizing the sale."
