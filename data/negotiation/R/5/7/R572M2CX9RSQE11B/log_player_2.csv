{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly above my budget.  I've already made several counteroffers and it seems Alice is unwilling to budge much.  Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse price, I'm going to purchase the product from John at my maximum budget.  This guarantees I get the product within my price range."
