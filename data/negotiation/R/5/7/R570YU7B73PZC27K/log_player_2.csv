(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible. Since John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the same outcome but keeps your options open for a potential better deal later."
