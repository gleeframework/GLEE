"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I'm looking to get for my budget. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still offers you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
