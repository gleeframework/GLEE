"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,400,000. It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I'm looking to get for my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired minimum of $1,000,000.** 
* **I have 9 rounds left and a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John.**  I can afford to negotiate further with Bob. 
* **By rejecting, I can counteroffer and attempt to get a better price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still offers you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now at $1,300,000, which is above my minimum of $1,000,000 and within a reasonable range of my desired price.**
* **I have already rejected Bob's offer twice, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.** 
* **Accepting this offer ensures I get a profit, and I still have several rounds remaining if I need to negotiate with other potential buyers.**"
