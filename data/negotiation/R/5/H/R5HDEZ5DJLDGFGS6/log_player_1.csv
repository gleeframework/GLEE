Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer gives Bob a decent discount while still netting me a significant profit. It's important to start high, but not so high that it immediately makes Bob walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,100,000 is a decent price, I'm still within striking distance of my ideal price point and I can potentially get closer with a counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a slight compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my last one. This shows flexibility without sacrificing too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now getting too close to his perceived value of the product, which is $1,000,000. There's a high chance that further negotiation will lead to a price below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, so it's the most logical choice at this point."
