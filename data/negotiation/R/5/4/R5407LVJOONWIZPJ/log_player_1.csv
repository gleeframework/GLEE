Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I want to see if I can push Bob to pay a bit more. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still leaving room for some profit.  $95 is a good middle ground, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me there.  If he rejects again, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get $95, $85 is still a good profit and better than my minimum acceptable price. It's also getting close to John's offer, so I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
