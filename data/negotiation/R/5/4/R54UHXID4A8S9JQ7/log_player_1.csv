"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I'm not desperate, and I know the product is worth more to Bob than $10,500.  I'll see if I can negotiate a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  I'm confident this is still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I can do $10200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,200 is better than John's offer, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I have several rounds left, and I'm confident I can close the deal at a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $10,700.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good value for you."", ""product_price"": 10700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10700 is still a bit above my budget. I can do $10300, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  Although $10,300 is closer to my minimum than John's offer, I'm still hopeful that I can get Bob to go higher. We have several rounds left, and I'm confident that I can close the deal at a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles. $10,300 is still not a good deal for me. Let's be realistic and aim for a price that benefits both of us. I'm willing to go down to $10,500 for this round. If you still think it's too high, let's end this and I'll deal with John."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, so I'll do $10150. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's significantly better than selling to John. We're only two rounds away from the end, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. $10,150 is a decent compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal at that price."
