"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10500.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  I'm confident this is still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I can do $10200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $10700.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good value for you.",10700.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10700 is still a bit above my budget. I can do $10300, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",10300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles. $10300 is still not a good deal for me. Let's be realistic and aim for a price that benefits both of us. I'm willing to go down to $10500 for this round. If you still think it's too high, let's end this and I'll deal with John.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, so I'll do $10150. That's the lowest I can go.",10150.0,Bob,8,
