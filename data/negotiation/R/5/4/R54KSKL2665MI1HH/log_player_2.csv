"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $110. I think it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Since the product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $110, it's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. How about we split the difference and settle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

While $100 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his $80 threshold.  It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price."
