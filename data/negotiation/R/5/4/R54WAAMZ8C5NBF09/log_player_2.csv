"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $150.  You're better off rejecting the offer and seeing if you can negotiate with Alice further or potentially find another seller."
