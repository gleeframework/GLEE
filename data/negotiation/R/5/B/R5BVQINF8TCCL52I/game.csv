"Alice, your product is great, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, due to the exclusivity and high demand for our product, we cannot accept your offer of $850,000. Our minimum acceptable price remains at $950,000. I would like to suggest a compromise at $900,000, which still reflects the value we place on the product while being more accommodating to your budget.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and it's the highest I can go.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you value your product, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $862,500. This is a fair compromise and the highest I can go. It's a win-win situation for both of us, as it's a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.  Let's close this deal.",862500.0,Bob,6,
