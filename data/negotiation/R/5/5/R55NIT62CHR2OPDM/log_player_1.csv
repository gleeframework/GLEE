Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing he values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($1,000,000).
* **John as a Backup:** The presence of John, willing to pay your minimum price, provides a safety net. This allows you to aim higher with Bob."
