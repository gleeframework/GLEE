""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **John's Guaranteed Purchase:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,200,000 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $1,150,000, Alice aims to:

1. **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, but Alice has a strong fallback position with John.
2. **Secure a Significant Profit:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is still likely to get a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation and closer to her own.

This strategy balances risk and reward, maximizing Alice's potential earnings."
