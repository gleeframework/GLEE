"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your price point, $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
