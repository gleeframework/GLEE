While $850,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a lower price."

While $825,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm not comfortable going that high.  It's only a small amount cheaper than what John is offering, and I don't want to risk a longer negotiation that could potentially go higher. I'll buy from John."
