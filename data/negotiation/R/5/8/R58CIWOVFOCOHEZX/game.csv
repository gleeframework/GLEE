"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $999000 is significantly higher than my budget. Considering the potential of the product, I'm willing to offer $600000. This reflects a fair value while staying within my financial limitations. Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $850000 is still beyond my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $750000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's reach a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable ask.",825000.0,Alice,5,
