"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaving room for further negotiation. This strategy aims to gauge Alice's willingness to lower the price while staying within my acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $92.50 is closer to my ideal price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, so I'll try pushing a little further before accepting or resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

I'm proposing a price slightly below Alice's latest offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise further but still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to sell for $90. I can do $95, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that $95 is her bottom line.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better price. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable deal, saving me $25 compared to John's offer."
