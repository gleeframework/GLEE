Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming for a good profit margin. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and encouraging message to hopefully make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, which is likely given the significant difference between my price and his perceived value. 
* **John as a Backup:** I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, so I can walk away from the negotiation if it doesn't reach a satisfactory price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, that's a bit high for me. I'm only interested if the price is closer to $80.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Although Bob's offer is unacceptable, he's shown interest in the product. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **John as a safety net:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $150, so I can afford to be firm and reject Bob's low offer. 

I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest!  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? That still gives me some profit and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $175 to $125. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Openness:**  I'm ending with a question to keep the conversation going and encourage Bob to accept. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there yet. $125 is closer, but I'm really aiming for something closer to $100. I think that's a fair price considering both of our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While $100 is closer to my minimum price of $150, it's still not enough. I need to maintain a decent profit margin.
* **Potential for Improvement:**  Bob is clearly willing to pay more than $80, showing a potential to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price slightly higher than his offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This would be a great price for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while you get a great product at a good price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Again):** I'm again meeting Bob halfway, moving from $125 to $110. This shows flexibility while still being closer to my desired price.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, highlighting the value of the product and the reasonable price. 
* **Staying Firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going lower than $110, as this is still above my minimum.

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I can always fall back on selling to John for $150."
