Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still represents a substantial saving compared to your alternative buyer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
