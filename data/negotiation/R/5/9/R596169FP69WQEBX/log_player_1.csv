"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I want to maximize my potential profit, so starting with a high offer is a good strategy. 
* **Not too high:**  $95 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $100.  
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly and approachable message encourages Bob to negotiate rather than immediately reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I think $85 would be a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $80, so $85 is close, but not ideal.
* **Potential for better deal:** Bob values the product at $100, meaning there's still room for me to negotiate a higher price. 
* **More rounds:** I have 9 rounds left, so I can continue to negotiate and try to get closer to my desired price.

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price. How about $90? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain my desired profit margin. 
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize a ""fair compromise"" and a ""happy"" outcome for both of us, encouraging Bob to consider accepting.
* **Still above my minimum:** $90 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, giving me some room to potentially go lower in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $87 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my ideal:** While $87 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm aiming for at least $90.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, and I have 6 rounds remaining. There's still potential to increase the price.
* **Risk of losing out:**  Selling to John for $80 is tempting, but I might be able to get a better deal with Bob if I continue negotiating.

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target price of $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $88.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($90) and Bob's latest offer ($87). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my desired $90.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I highlight that $88 is a ""good deal"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and encouraging him to accept.
* **Keeping the deal alive:** By offering a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation process going and avoiding a premature decision to sell to John for $80. With 5 rounds remaining, I still have a chance to get closer to my desired price."
