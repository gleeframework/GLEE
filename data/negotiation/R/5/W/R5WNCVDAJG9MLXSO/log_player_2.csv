Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still above your absolute maximum of $12,000.
* You've already negotiated quite a bit and it's unclear if Alice will go lower. 
* To avoid risking further negotiation and ensure you get the product within your budget, it's best to buy from John at this point."
