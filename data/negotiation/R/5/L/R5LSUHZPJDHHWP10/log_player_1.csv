Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I still feel that $8,000 is the maximum I can realistically pay for this product. I hope we can reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  Bob seems determined to pay only $8,000, and I've already reduced my price twice. There's a chance I could get more from him, but with only 6 rounds left, I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing out on the deal."
