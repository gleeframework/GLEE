Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob immediately walks away. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
2. **Justify:**  Provide a reason for the high price (e.g., market demand, unique features).
3. **Leave Room:**  Understand you'll likely need to come down a bit in negotiations.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and high demand in the market, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 is above Bob's value but below your guaranteed price.
* **Justification:** The message hints at reasons for the high price without revealing your guaranteed offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording suggests willingness to discuss the price further. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive starting point might be better."
