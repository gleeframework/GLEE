"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1500000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You have a guaranteed alternative with John for $1,500,000.  Alice's offer is also $1,500,000. Since you don't know the value of the product to Alice, there's no reason to believe she's offering a better deal than John.  Therefore, you might as well go with the certain option and buy from John."
