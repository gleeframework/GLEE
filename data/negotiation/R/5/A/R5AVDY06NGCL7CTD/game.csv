"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, as I believe that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on my last offer and pay $11,000. I think this is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
