"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is less than Alice's asking price of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly closer to his budget but still gives Alice a reasonable profit margin.  This is a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his budget than John's offer.  Since Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, but also wants to buy the product, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice at this point."
