"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to start the negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay. It's best to negotiate and see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some profit for you as well. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000. This is a fair compromise and allows for some profit for you while remaining within my budget. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,500. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for my product, considering its value to me and the value it holds for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $9,750. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's budget. Since John is offering a price within Bob's budget, it's the best choice to secure the product and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
