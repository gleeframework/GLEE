"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's worth to me is no less than $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm not sure if the product is worth $950,000 to me, and Alice's minimum value of $1,000,000 is not relevant to my decision. I'll reject the offer and buy the product from John for $800,000.
