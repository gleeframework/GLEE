Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, but $800,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, considering it's worth $1,500,000 to you. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It seems unlikely Alice will go lower than $1,050,000. Accepting now avoids the risk of the deal falling through and having to buy from John at the higher price."
