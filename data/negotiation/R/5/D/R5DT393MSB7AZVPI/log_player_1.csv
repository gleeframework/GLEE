Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. Here's why:

* **Value Gap:** There's a $5,000 gap between our valuations. Offering $14,000 gives Bob a good deal while still ensuring I get a decent price.
* **Counteroffer Anticipation:** I'm anticipating Bob will counteroffer. This strategy allows for potential compromise and potentially a final price closer to $14,000.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  John's offer of $15,000 provides me with a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail. This allows me to be more aggressive in my initial offer. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value and even my initial offer to Bob.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counter-offer in the next round.  

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum Value:** I'm not willing to sell below $15,000.  $11,000 is too far below that threshold.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I can likely push Bob closer to my desired price by rejecting his offer and presenting a counter-offer. 
* **Time Factor:** I'm not under any immediate pressure to sell, so I can afford to continue the negotiation.

I'll aim to find a compromise price that works for both of us in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $12,500. This represents a compromise between Bob's offer of $11,000 and my previous offer of $14,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm moving closer to Bob's price, $12,500 is still higher than his offer, giving me some leverage.
* **Value Gap Closure:** This offer reduces the value gap between us, increasing the chances of a successful deal.

I believe this offer is reasonable and fair, and hopefully, it will lead to a successful transaction with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is an improvement over his previous offer, it's still too far below my minimum value and my desired outcome.  I'm rejecting his offer and will make another counter-offer in the next round.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** I'm not willing to sell below $15,000.  $11,500 is still a significant discount from that.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I can potentially push him closer to my desired price in the next round.
* **Time Factor:**  I have the luxury of time and can afford to continue negotiating with Bob.

My next counter-offer will aim to close the remaining gap between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $12,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer of $12,500 but still significantly higher than Bob's latest offer of $11,500.

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  This offer demonstrates my willingness to compromise further, bridging the gap between our valuations. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm reducing my price, it's still above Bob's offer, giving me some leverage in the negotiation.
* **Final Offer Potential:** I believe this offer represents a reasonable compromise and could be my final offer before considering selling to John. 

I'm hoping that this counter-offer will convince Bob to accept and conclude our negotiations."
