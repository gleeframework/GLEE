"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I still feel that $850000 would be a fair price for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $925000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. Let's meet in the middle at $912500, but I'm only willing to go that low if you're willing to commit to the sale today. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to agree to a price above $875000. This is my final counteroffer.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've made a significant concession already, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. If you're still not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I believe $887500 is a reasonable price for us both. I hope you can accept this offer.",887500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've been patient and flexible, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiations. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need you to meet me at $900000. If not, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to another buyer who is willing to pay the full value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm sorry to hear that you're considering other options. I've done my best to negotiate within my budget constraints. My final offer is $895000 for the product. I hope this meets your needs and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",895000.0,Bob,10,
