(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $800,000. There's no reason to accept it.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000. This is a strong opening counteroffer that shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also sets a clear limit. We'll see if she's willing to come down."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than my budget. I will continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better deal. There's no point in accepting an offer that's still too expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $900,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but still want a price closer to my budget. It's a reasonable middle ground that might encourage her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's closer to my budget, but I'm not willing to accept anything over $800,000. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $950,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where Alice might be willing to accept, but still keep the price within a reasonable range for me. We're getting closer, and this counteroffer shows I'm committed to finding a solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice won't budge, and I'll be left with no product.  It's better to secure the product now at a known price from John, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible price."
