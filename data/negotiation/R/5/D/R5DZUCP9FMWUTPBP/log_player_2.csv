"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get an even better deal.  Bob has 10 rounds, so there's time to explore a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible price.  He's offering $1,050,000, which is still a decent profit for Alice ($50,000 over her valuation). This initial counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to push the price down, potentially getting a better deal before he has to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while also staying within his budget.  Offering $1,075,000 keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further. This strategy aims to find a compromise price that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice is now offering a price that's only $40,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer, and significantly lower than John's offer. Accepting this offer will save Bob a considerable amount of money.  While there might be a chance to get a slightly better deal, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and then needing to buy from John for a much higher price outweighs the potential for a smaller saving."
