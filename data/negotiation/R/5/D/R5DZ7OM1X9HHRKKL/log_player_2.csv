"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is less than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000. This product is definitely valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $14,000 is already a very competitive price for what this product offers.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $13,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price.  While $13,000 is closer to his ideal price, he can still attempt to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm firm on my previous offer of $12,000.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
