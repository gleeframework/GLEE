Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could yield a better outcome.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  A price of $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Confidence and Value Highlighting:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Alice's confidence in its worth, potentially influencing Bob's perception."
