You're still above your budget.  Reject the offer and try to negotiate further. You can likely get closer to your target price with another counteroffer."

While you could continue to counteroffer, Alice is clearly not budging much.  You've reached a point where it's more advantageous to buy from John for $1,500,000. This saves you $175,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
