"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $2000000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend at this time. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $1500000? I'm genuinely interested in the product and believe we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1750000. This is a very competitive price, considering its value to me is at least $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going. How about $1600000? It's a fair compromise and still within my budget.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to come to an agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $1675000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. I believe this price still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.
