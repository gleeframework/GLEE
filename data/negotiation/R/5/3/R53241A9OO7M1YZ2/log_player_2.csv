Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To find common ground, I am willing to reconsider our previous offer. I propose a price of $9000 for the product. This still represents a premium value, while being more accommodating to your financial situation. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties.

Bob is still determined to get the best possible price.  While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob another opportunity to try and secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've carefully considered your proposal and I'm glad to see we're moving closer to an agreement. In light of this, I am willing to offer the product at a price of $8900. I believe this strikes a balance between the value of the product and your budgetary considerations. I look forward to your response and hope we can finalize this transaction.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,900, which is only $900 above Bob's maximum price of $8,000. This is a good deal, considering Bob could buy from John for $8,000. It's worth accepting the offer and ending the negotiation to avoid the risk of further counteroffers and potential delays."
