Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more. I believe it's high enough to pique Bob's interest but not so high that he'll immediately reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can do better. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and ensures that I'm above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value, but I don't see a way to get more from him. I'm confident that John will buy the product for the same price. Selling to John guarantees the sale and allows me to move on without further negotiation."
