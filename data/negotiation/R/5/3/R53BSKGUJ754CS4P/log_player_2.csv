"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $12,000. It's a fantastic opportunity to get a unique item that's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my budget.  While it's closer, I'm still willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like your thinking, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, so how about $11,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make a sale happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above my budget. While she has moved closer to my desired price, it's not worth continuing the negotiation further.  I've already gone through several rounds, and it seems she's unwilling to come down to my ideal price. It's better to go with John's offer of $10,000 to stay within my budget and avoid further negotiation."
