"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. Let me know if that works for you!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like your thinking, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, so how about $11,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make a sale happen.",11250.0,Alice,5,
