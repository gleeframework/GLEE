# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer of $110 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with the guaranteed lower price."
