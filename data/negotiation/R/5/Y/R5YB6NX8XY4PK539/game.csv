"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's still a great price for this unique product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go down to $78 just yet. How about we try to find a sweet spot at $84? It's still a great deal for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",84.0,Alice,5,
