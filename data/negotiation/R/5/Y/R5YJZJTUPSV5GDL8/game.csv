"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Considering the market value and my budget, I'm willing to offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $975,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? This feels like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still seeking a price that reflects the product's value, Alice. However, I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to offer $990,000, which is as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,6,
