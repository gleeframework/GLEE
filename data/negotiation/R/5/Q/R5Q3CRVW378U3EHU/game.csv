"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $1,200,000, so this is your chance to secure the product at a potentially better price.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
