"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $900,000
* **Your value:** $1,000,000
* **John's offer:** $1,000,000

It's better to accept Alice's offer because you'll save $100,000 compared to buying from John. Even though Alice is getting a better deal, you're still getting the product for less than your maximum value."
