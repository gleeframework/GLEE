"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is still too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially reach a more favorable deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This price still gives me a significant profit, but also takes into account your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's meet at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,250,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer to his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer ensures Bob acquires the product at a price that is within his budget and significantly lower than John's price."
