"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value.  I'll reject this offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.  This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for significantly less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm dropping my price again, but I'm still holding firm above $900,000.  We're getting closer to a compromise. If he rejects this, I'll consider selling to John, but I'll try one more offer first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable, and we're running out of rounds.  I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob, so I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This ensures I get my minimum value and secures the deal."
