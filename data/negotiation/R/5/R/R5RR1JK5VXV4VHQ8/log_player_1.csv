Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product.  It's valuable to both of us, and I think it could really benefit you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value but doesn't explicitly state why the price is above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for Bob to accept, counter-offer, or ask for clarification.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer primarily gauges Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John."
