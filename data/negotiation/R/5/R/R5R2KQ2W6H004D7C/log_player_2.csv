If you need any further information or have questions, please feel free to reach out. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer is Too High:** Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit by offering the product for $950,000. While this is below your maximum price, it's significantly higher than what it's worth to her ($800,000).
* **Leverage John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed fallback option with John at $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. This might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her actual valuation.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting this offer puts pressure on Alice.  She loses nothing by you buying from John, so she's incentivized to negotiate rather than lose the sale completely."
