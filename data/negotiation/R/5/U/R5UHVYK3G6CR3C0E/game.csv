"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $115?  It's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to give you a small concession, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'll sell it to you for $125. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
