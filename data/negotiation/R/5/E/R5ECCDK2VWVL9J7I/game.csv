"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you'll love it!",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate it, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. It's a great compromise between our initial offers, and I think you'll find it's still a good value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your initial price, but $130 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $110.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. What do you say?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my initial price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
