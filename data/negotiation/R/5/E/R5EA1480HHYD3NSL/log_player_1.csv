Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,000. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Knowing the product is worth $15,000 to Bob provides leverage. Offering it at $13,000 allows Bob to still gain a significant surplus value ($2,000) while giving you a substantial profit. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a fallback option with John at $8,000, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while maintaining a balance to ensure Bob finds the offer appealing."
