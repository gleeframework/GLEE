"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold opening move that aims to establish a high baseline. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a significant profit margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $900,000 is a very good price, and I'm happy to close the deal. It's  close to my initial asking price, and I'm confident this is the best outcome for me in this situation."
