Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point as it's higher than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm also confident that I can get at least $120 from John if I need to, so I'm not under too much pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $95.  While it's better than his initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $105. This is still a fair price considering the product's worth to him, and it's closer to my desired price range. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $120 from John.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, it's not worth risking a further drop in price."
