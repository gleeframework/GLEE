"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is a bit above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will find the product valuable, and this price allows for a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum of $80.  While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $85 is simply not enough for me to cover my costs.  How about $95? That's still a great price for a product worth $120 to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95, which is still a decent profit for me and a good deal for Bob. I'm hoping he'll be willing to compromise a bit more to get this deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is finally above my minimum of $80, and it's a good deal considering the product's value to him. I'm happy to accept and close the deal."
