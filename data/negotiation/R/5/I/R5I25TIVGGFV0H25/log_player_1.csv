Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique nature and your specific interest, I'm proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have a strong position. Starting high allows you to potentially gain significantly more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's unique interest, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, the message invites discussion, leaving room for negotiation if Bob pushes back.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging that Bob might try to negotiate a lower price. If he rejects your offer, you can always rely on John as a backup buyer."
