Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I have a budget in mind. Could we do it for $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $70 is too low. I can go down to $100, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above your budget and has stated her last offer is $100.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $80. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
