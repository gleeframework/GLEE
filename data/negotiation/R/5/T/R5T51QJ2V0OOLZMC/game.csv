"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $105 is still too far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112.50.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I really appreciate your interest in the product. However, $110 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",108.0,Bob,8,
