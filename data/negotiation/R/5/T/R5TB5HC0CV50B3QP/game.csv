"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the product's exceptional qualities and the value it will bring to your endeavors.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be sure this deal makes sense for both of us.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,100,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects my strong desire to see this product in your capable hands.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of offering $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
