{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $13,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could accept and get something, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

While $10,750 is closer to my goal, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get closer to $12,000 with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $10,750 is still a bit too low. Let's try $11,250. That's a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about we settle this at $11,000 even? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my goal.  Further negotiations might not get me a significantly better price, and it's getting close to what I'd get selling to John.  It's time to close the deal."
