"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice! However, $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $140? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm going to counter with $155. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice! However, $155 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $155, so how about $142.50? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",142.5,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm going to counter with $148. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. What do you think?",148.0,Alice,7,
