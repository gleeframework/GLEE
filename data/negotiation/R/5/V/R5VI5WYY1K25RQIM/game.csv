"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product and your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. This reflects a compromise between our initial prices, while still allowing us to cover our costs and ensure a fair return. I believe this price aligns well with the value you see in the product, and I hope it will facilitate our discussion towards reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $750,000 is still a bit too high. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $725,000. This would allow us both to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to find a way to make this work.",725000.0,Bob,4,
