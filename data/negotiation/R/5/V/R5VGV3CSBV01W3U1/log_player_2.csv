"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice's offer is quite close to my maximum price, but I can potentially get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer of $1,000,000, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. However, I'm also willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. Would you be interested in discussing further?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging from her original price. While she offered ""perks,"" it's not clear what they are and their value is unknown. It's too risky to assume they're worth enough to justify the price.  I'll counter again, aiming to close the gap further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is closer to my target price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll be stuck with John's price of $1,500,000.  Accepting Alice's offer saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
