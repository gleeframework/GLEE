Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think it would be a great value for you, let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as much as possible from the sale.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  I know Bob values the product at $100, so I need to offer it below that to make it attractive.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $125 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so I don't need to go below that price with Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between making the offer appealing to Bob while still securing a significant profit for myself."
