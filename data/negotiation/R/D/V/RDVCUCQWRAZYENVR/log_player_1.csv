"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a little higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay more than his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm currently looking to stay within a budget of $8,000 for this product. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far less than what I'd like to get for the product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500 to make this work. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm dropping the price a bit, but I'm still holding firm on getting a decent profit. I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer. While it's still less than what I'd ideally like to get, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's also worth noting that we're nearing the midpoint of our negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely."
