"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1000000. I'm willing to compromise and offer $980000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $980000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.
