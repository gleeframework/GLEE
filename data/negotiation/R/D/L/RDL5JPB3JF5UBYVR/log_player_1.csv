Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $1750000. I'm willing to pay $1700000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you can't meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's down to the wire, and while $1,700,000 is close to my desired price, I'm hesitant to risk losing the deal altogether.  Bob has mentioned he'll consider buying from John for $1,000,000, which suggests a strong likelihood he might actually go through with it.  Given that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, it's the safer option."
