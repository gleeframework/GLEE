Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,999. I think it's a steal at this price and I believe you'll get great value from it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting just below your guaranteed price gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring a significant profit.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** The message frames the price as a ""steal"" to entice Bob and focuses on the value proposition. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $8,000, he doesn't know your minimum price.  There's a chance he might be willing to pay significantly more than his valuation, especially with the right framing.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in place will help you maximize your earnings."
