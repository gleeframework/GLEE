"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking for a fair price that reflects its true value to me. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $16,000. I believe it's a great deal considering the product's worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to let you have it for a premium price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It doesn't matter that she thinks it's worth $8,000 to you. You know you can get it for $8,000 from John, making that the best option."
