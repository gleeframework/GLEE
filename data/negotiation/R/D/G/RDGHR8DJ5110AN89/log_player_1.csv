"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully allows me to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to significantly drop my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my desired price, and it's better than selling to John.  I'm going to accept his offer."
