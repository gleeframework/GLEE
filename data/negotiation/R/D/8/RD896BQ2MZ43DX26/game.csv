"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget constraints. However, $85 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is still a great deal for you and allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $100 is closer, but still a bit too high.  I can do $90.  Let's make this happen!",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress. While I appreciate your offer, $90 is still a bit below what I need. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with this product.",95.0,Alice,5,
