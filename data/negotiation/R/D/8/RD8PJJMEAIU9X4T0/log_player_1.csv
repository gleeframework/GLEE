Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, attempting to sell to Bob first at a higher price could net a larger profit.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 strikes a balance. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but still potentially attractive enough for him to accept, considering the perceived value he might gain.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. We can then potentially settle on a price that's still higher than John's offer."
