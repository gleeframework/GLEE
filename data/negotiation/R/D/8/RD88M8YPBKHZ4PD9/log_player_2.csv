"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for much less than $900,000. Since your maximum is $1,500,000 and the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price of $900,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  It still leaves room for Alice to make a profit since the product is worth $800,000 to her.
* **Your Budget:**  It's well within your budget of $1,500,000.

By starting with a lower counteroffer, you signal your willingness to negotiate and potentially save more money in the process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Alice's offer is closer to your budget, but there's still room to bargain. The product is worth $800,000 to her, and she's willing to sell for $850,000, so you can likely get it for a lower price.
* **Potential savings:**  Rejecting and counter-offering could save you even more money than accepting Alice's offer. 

By rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer, you continue to push for a better deal without committing to a price that's still higher than necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer of $650,000 and Alice's offer of $850,000.
* **Fair price:** It's still a good deal for you, and allows Alice to make a profit since the product is worth $800,000 to her.
* **Negotiation tactic:** This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to meet Alice halfway, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** Alice's offer of $825,000 is within your budget and is a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited potential for further savings:**  While you could try to counteroffer again, there's a good chance Alice will stick to her offer.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject Alice's offer and she decides to stop negotiating, you'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.

Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product for a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
