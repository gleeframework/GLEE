Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it would be of great value to you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit above my minimum ($12,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to accept an offer below my minimum."
