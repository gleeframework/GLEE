"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  This is my maximum offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my needs.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1000000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1000000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm prepared to go as high as $900000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to move on to another seller.",900000.0,Bob,4,
