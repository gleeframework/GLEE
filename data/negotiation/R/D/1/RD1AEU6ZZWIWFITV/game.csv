"Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is unfortunately too high for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $975,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However, $975,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and it's still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is enough to compensate for the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a significant amount for me. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $910,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm afraid it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to walking away from the deal. I'm offering you the product for $920,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,7,
