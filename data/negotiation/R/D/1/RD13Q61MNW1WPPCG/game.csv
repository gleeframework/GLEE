"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $95?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both walk away happy.",95.0,Bob,4,
