Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** This price point suggests you understand the product's value to Bob without being overly aggressive."
