"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a great product, but I've done my research and I think it's worth a bit less than your initial offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to find a buyer who can fully appreciate its value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the unique benefits this product offers and still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I still believe this product is worth more than $1,250,000. To demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm offering it for $1,300,000.
