"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be worth the same to you. I'm offering it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price, considering its value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer waiting in the wings.",8500.0,Alice,1,
