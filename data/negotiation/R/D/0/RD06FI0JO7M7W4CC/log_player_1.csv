Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging a response from Bob.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to me, implying a good deal for Bob.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to negotiate, but I have a backup buyer (John) who offers my desired price, giving me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but I'm only able to go up to $8,500 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Even though it's above his initial perceived value, it's still too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price. There's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, considering your interest. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from the initial offer.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is a good deal for him by mentioning the value of the product.
* **Fairness:** I'm positioning the new price as fair and beneficial for both of us, promoting a win-win situation.
* **Decision Point:** I'm giving Bob a clear decision point and encouraging him to respond to my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $10,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. Let me know if you're interested in that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's getting closer, I'm not confident that I can negotiate a price I'm happy with.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000, as this guarantees me my desired profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
