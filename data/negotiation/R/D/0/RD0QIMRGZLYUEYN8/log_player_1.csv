``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I've set the initial price at $10,000. This allows for room to negotiate and ensures I'm not leaving any money on the table. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights the product's features and benefits to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I've made it clear that I'm willing to discuss the price, showing flexibility.
* **Plan B:**  I have the option of selling to John for $8,000, so I won't settle for anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is closer, but still above my minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum of $8,000, it's still higher than what I'm willing to settle for right now.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate further, as Bob clearly expressed interest in the product. 
* **Strategic advantage:** By rejecting the offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can explore a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,500 is closer to my ideal price, I'm aiming for a little more.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,750?  This still gives you a good deal considering the [mention the product's unique features and benefits again], and it's a fair compromise for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price of $9,750, which is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.
* **Highlighting value again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique features and benefits to emphasize the value of the deal, even at the slightly higher price.
* **Open to final negotiation:** I've ended the message with a question, inviting Bob to engage in further negotiation to reach a final agreement.

**Important:** I'm aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum of $8,000 but also acknowledging that Bob is a serious buyer. My goal is to reach a mutually agreeable price in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still interested in the product, but $9750 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9200? I think that's a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close but not enough:**  While Bob's offer of $9,200 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable settling at this point.  
* **Potential for better deal:**  I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price range of $9,500 or higher.  
* **Maintaining negotiation control:** By rejecting the offer, I can continue the negotiation and see if I can secure a better price.

**Reasoning:**

I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm not willing to sell for anything below $9,500 at this point. I want to see if I can nudge Bob a little higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,200 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  However, I'm willing to make a final concession.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,400?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this unique product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm offering a price of $9,400, which is a significant concession from my previous counteroffer but still above my minimum. 
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this is a final concession to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Reinforce Product Value:** I'm reminding Bob about the unique features and benefits of the product, making the price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Final Decision:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts, leaving the door open for a final agreement.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, I'm hoping to close the deal. I've made a significant concession, and $9,400 is a good price for me. However, if Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John for $8,000 to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your final offer. I'm still interested in the product, but $9400 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9200? I think that's a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits, and I'm willing to make a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is insistent on $9,200, which is below my desired price range.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing negotiations could drag on, and I'm already near my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees a sale without further negotiation.  

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,500, the risk of further negotiation without a clear path to agreement is not worth it.  John's offer provides a guaranteed income, and I'm not confident I can push Bob higher."
