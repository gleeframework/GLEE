"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $120 is still too high, as he's willing to pay up to $150.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  How about we split the difference at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $110. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still within Bob's budget ($150) and represents a significant reduction from her initial offer of $120.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and the price might go back up.  It's more likely that he can secure a good deal by accepting this offer."
