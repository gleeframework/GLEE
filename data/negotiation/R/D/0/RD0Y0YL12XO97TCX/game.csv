"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  How about we split the difference at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $110. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
