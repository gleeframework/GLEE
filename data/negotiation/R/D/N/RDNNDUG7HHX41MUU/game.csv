"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in your product, $1800000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've described. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1600000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1400000. This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my budget. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $1520000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.
