"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is my best price for now.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your bottom line. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,280,000 was a bit too low for you, so I'll meet you in the middle at $1,265,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1265000.0,Alice,7,
