"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $750,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming back with a revised price. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $850,000.

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers. I hope we can reach an agreement in this round.",825000.0,Alice,5,
