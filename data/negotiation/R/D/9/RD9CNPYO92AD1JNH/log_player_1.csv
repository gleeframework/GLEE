With only two rounds left, it's getting too risky to keep negotiating.  Bob's offers are getting closer, but it's not clear if we'll reach a deal that satisfies me. To avoid the risk of getting stuck with a lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and I'm guaranteed to get my minimum."
