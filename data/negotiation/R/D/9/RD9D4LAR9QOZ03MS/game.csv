"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to make this work. This price still allows me to gain a reasonable profit while also making this a worthwhile investment for you. Let's see if we can find a common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,
