Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to make this work. This price still allows me to gain a reasonable profit while also making this a worthwhile investment for you. Let's see if we can find a common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
