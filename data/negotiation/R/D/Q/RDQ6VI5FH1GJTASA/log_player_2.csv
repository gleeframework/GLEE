{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are aiming to get the product for $80 or less.
* Alice's offer of $120 is too high.
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I want to start by making a bold counteroffer that is within my budget.
* $80 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. 
* This will immediately show Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and not willing to pay her asking price."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my target of $80.
* I'm willing to continue negotiating, as there's a chance I can get a better price or Alice might accept my previous offer of $80.
* Buying from John is still a viable option, but I want to exhaust all negotiation options first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly from $80 to $90. 
* This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still want a good deal.
* It also keeps me within my budget. 
* I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer as a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $95 is getting closer to my target price, but it's still above my budget.
* We've gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and it seems Alice is not willing to go any lower than $95.
* It's more efficient to buy from John at $80, as I'm unlikely to get a better deal from Alice.
* This ensures I get the product within my budget and saves me time."
