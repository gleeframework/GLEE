,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you want a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  I appreciate your offer, but $9,200 is still a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to go down to $9,350. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",9350.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,350. I'm willing to go up to $9,250, but that's my final offer. Can you consider this?",9250.0,Bob,6,
