Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it leaves room for negotiation and still presents a good value proposition for Bob. I'll be watching Bob's response closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not eager to sell at that point. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. This gives me a better chance of securing a higher price while also maintaining a good relationship with Bob for potential future dealings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still lower than I initially hoped, it's a reasonable compromise and brings me closer to my desired price.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Bob walking away and me having to settle for John's lower offer is too high. $1,300,000 is a good deal, and I'd rather secure the sale than risk losing out entirely."
