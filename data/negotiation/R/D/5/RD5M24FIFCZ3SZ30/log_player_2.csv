"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can do better than $100, so you should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $92.5 is closer to your goal, you can still potentially get a better deal. You should try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  $92.50 is closer but still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. How about we compromise at $91? I think that's the best we can do and still make this a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

```

It's getting close to your maximum, and Alice seems firm.  Accepting the offer at $91 is a good compromise, saving you $29 compared to John."
