"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  $92.50 is closer but still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. How about we compromise at $91? I think that's the best we can do and still make this a fair deal for both of us.",91.0,Alice,5,
