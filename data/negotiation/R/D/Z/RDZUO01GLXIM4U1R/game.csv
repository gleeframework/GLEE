"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested in your product, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $7500.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $7500 is tempting, I need to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $8500?  I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $8500 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
