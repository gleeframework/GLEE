"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,450,000. This is a good starting point as it's below his estimated value but still leaves me with a substantial profit.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $1,400,000. This is a compromise that still leaves me with a good profit while being more appealing to Bob than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While we're getting closer, I believe I can still get a higher price. We're in the middle of the negotiation process and I want to keep exploring options before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,375,000. This is a further compromise, but I still believe it's a fair price for both of us. I want to reach an agreement quickly, but I'm not willing to settle for a price too far below my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's slightly below my ideal price, we're nearing the end of the negotiation and it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  I'd rather secure the sale at this price than risk ending up with John's offer, which would be significantly less profitable."
