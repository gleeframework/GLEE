"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to match this price again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Let me know if that's something you'd be open to discussing."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your target price is $800000, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I know this product holds. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price.**  $850,000 is a significant reduction from the initial $900,000.
* **There's still risk in rejecting.** If Bob rejects and counters again, there's a chance Alice will stick to her price or even increase it. 
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  While John's price is guaranteed, Alice's current offer is already within Bob's target range and likely a better deal overall.

**It's a good idea to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price.**"
