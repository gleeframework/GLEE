"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $125?  That's still a great deal for a product worth $120 to you.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for $120. ",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have other options, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $115 to you. How about $120? That's the price John is willing to pay, and it's a fair deal for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
