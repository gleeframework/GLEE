"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This still allows for a good profit for you, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This allows for a reasonable profit for me and still represents a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
