"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is a good price, it's worth trying to negotiate further. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's $10 lower than Alice's initial price. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating, but it's still a reasonable price given that I'm willing to pay $100 for the product from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $75, which is a good price considering my maximum is $100. It's worth accepting this offer to save $25 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and having to buy from John at the higher price."
