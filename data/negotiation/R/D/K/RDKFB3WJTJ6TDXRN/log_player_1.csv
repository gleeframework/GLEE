""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's guaranteed sale to John sets her floor at $1,200,000. Aiming higher than Bob's $1,000,000 valuation is key to maximizing profit.
* **Finding a Balance:** A price of $1,150,000 splits the difference between Bob's valuation and John's guaranteed purchase. This offers a potential win-win:
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than it's worth to him.
    * Alice earns $150,000 more than Bob's initial valuation.
* **First-Mover Advantage:** By offering a seemingly reasonable price upfront, Alice increases the chances of a quick sale to Bob, avoiding potential delays with John. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept. If he negotiates, Alice can slightly lower the price, but staying closer to $1,200,000 is in her best interest."
