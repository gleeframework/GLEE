Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers a safe $1,000,000, Bob values the product much higher.  Our goal is to get as close to that $1,500,000 value as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also signals that we understand the product's high value. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly, preventing him from lowballing or stalling."
