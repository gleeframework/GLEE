"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer:**  You'd pay $1,200,000 from Alice versus $1,500,000 from John.
* **You're still saving money:** Even at $1,200,000, you're getting the product for less than your maximum price of $1,500,000."
