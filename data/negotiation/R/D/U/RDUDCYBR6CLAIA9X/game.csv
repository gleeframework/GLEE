"Bob, I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $980000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1080000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1020000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1100000, which is actually my original offer from round 1. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal. Let's see if we can wrap this up.",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1050000 for the product.
