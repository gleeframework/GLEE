Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves him with a potential ""win"" if he can negotiate you down even slightly.
* **Alternative Option:**  By having John as a backup, I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob. This strengthens my negotiating position."
