"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

The product is worth $12,000 to you. Alice's offer of $18,000 is way too high.  You'll try to negotiate a lower price first before resorting to buying from John."
