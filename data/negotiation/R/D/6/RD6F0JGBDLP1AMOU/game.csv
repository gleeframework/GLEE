"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I agree your product is great, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?  That would be a win-win for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch for you, but I still believe my product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price.  To be honest, $12,000 is the highest I can go.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
