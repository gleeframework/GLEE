# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I agree your product is great, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?  That would be a win-win for both of us."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch for you, but I still believe my product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $12,500.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation as we have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $12,000 from John. This saves us $500 and avoids further back-and-forth."
