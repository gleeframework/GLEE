Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 
 
I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}

I'm reducing the price slightly, but still aiming for a higher profit than what John offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still higher than what John is offering, and we're getting closer to a deal.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but the potential for a higher price isn't worth the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
