"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below the value you've placed on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
