"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'll use this first round to gauge his interest and potential negotiation range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. It's still early in the negotiation, and I have 8 rounds left to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to reach a mutually agreeable price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I have several rounds left to work with and can still sell to John for $800,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $850,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my last offer and only $50,000 above my minimum. I'm trying to signal that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still holding out for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and close the deal, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum. I have four rounds left to work with and can still sell to John for $800,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $800,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept.  I'm running out of rounds, and if he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is it. Bob is clearly not going to budge, and I'm down to my last two rounds. I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to Bob for $700,000 and potentially ending up with nothing in the next round."
