Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a good starting point considering my minimum value is $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it right away. I'll try to see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $175. This is halfway between my desired price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still hoping to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $160 is better than John's offer of $150, so I'll accept it and sell the product to Bob."
