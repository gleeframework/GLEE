Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $140, you're aiming for a price that's attractive to Bob (saving him $10) while maximizing your potential profit.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, who values the product more than your backup option (John)."
