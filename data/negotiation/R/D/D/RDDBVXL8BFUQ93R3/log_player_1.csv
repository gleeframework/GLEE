{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point,  allowing me to potentially earn $2,000 more than Bob values the product. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept and get something rather than nothing,  I'm willing to risk further negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price, and selling to John for $12,000 is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. "", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,375? That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $8,375 is a lot closer to what I'm looking for. It's still a bit less than my ideal price, but it's better than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing or having to sell to John for $12,000.  I'm confident I can find other buyers in the future if I need to."
