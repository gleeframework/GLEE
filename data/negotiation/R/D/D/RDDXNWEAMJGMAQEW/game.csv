"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it holds even greater potential for your business. To make this a win-win, I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me.  How about we start the negotiations at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too far below the value I'm aiming for.  I understand this is a significant investment, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering the product for $900,000. This price still gives you a great opportunity for growth, and it allows me to get a return on my investment.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $800,000? That would be a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's full potential. $800,000 is getting closer, but I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $850,000?  This price allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's work together to make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle this right now at $825,000?  It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",825000.0,Bob,6,
