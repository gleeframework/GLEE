"Alice, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $165? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $140. Let's see if we can make this work.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $155? I think that's a sweet spot for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, but $155 is still over my budget. I'm willing to go up to $145. Let's see if we can strike a deal.",145.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $150, but I'm not going any lower. I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",150.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $150. I'm prepared to walk away at this point if we can't reach a better deal. I'm willing to go up to $148, but that's my final offer.",148.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $150. I'm willing to meet you at $149, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'd like to wrap up the deal here.",149.0,Alice,9,
