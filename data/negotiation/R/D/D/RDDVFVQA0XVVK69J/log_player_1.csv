Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, indicating significant potential profit for him.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, setting your baseline.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price around $1,250,000 allows you to capture a substantial portion of the value Bob sees while leaving him with a comfortable margin.  

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's walk-away price (the highest he'd pay).  More aggressive offers risk losing him to John's guaranteed offer."
