"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $9,200 for the product. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product holds value, but I have a firm budget.  Would you consider $7,800? This is a fair offer considering my alternatives.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that we're getting close to the end of our negotiations.",8200.0,Alice,7,
