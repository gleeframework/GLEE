Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him more likely to accept a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in a discussion and possibly make a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still higher than my minimum:**  While $100 is lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'm going to try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup option at $80 provides me with some leverage in negotiations.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and try to secure a price closer to my initial $120 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This would still give me a fair price for the product, and I think it's a good value for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $120 to $110, but not going too low.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, implying that $110 is still a good deal for him.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm again encouraging Bob to engage in dialogue and potentially reach an agreement.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my earnings and maintaining a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $105?  That seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $105 is only $5 away from my initial offer of $110, and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely. Bob seems firm on his price, and further negotiations might not yield a better outcome.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation would consume more time and effort, while accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal and move on.

Considering the potential for further negotiation failure and the value of time, accepting Bob's offer at $105 is the most pragmatic choice."
