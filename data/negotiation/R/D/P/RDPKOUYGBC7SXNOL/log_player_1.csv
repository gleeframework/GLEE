{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that is above Bob's valuation but below my minimum.  It leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  I'm prepared to lower the price if necessary, but I'll also be ready to move on to John if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $14,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price from either Bob or John, so I will reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,500 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we try $13,000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is close enough to my minimum desired price of $14,000. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
