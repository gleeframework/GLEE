"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it has the potential to be even more lucrative for you.  This price is  firm, but it's also fair given the product's worth to you.  Let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further if you reject this initial offer."
