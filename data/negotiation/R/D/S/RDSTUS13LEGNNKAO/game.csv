"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While $7,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,500? It's still a great deal for a product worth $8,000 to you. Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Alice,3,
