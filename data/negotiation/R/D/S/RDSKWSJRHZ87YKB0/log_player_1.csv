Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and open to negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to emphasize the potential benefits for Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** I'm aiming for a price that is as close as possible to my minimum value while still leaving room for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to counter Bob's offers and negotiate to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring that I can still achieve my desired outcome even if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is closer to my minimum value of $15,000, but I still have room for a better deal.
* **Potential for a Higher Price:**  By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round of negotiations.
* **John's Backup Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which gives me leverage in the negotiations with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows him I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if needed.
* **Seek a Better Deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially secure a price closer to my desired $15,000. 
* **Avoid Settling:** I'm not ready to settle for $13,000, especially since John is willing to pay more.

**Next Step:** 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $14,000. I will use a similar tone as my initial offer but also reiterate that I have a backup buyer who is willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm sure you understand I have other potential buyers, including one who is willing to pay my asking price.  I'm open to meeting you halfway, so how about $13,500? It's a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiterating Value:** I reiterate that I have other potential buyers to remind Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** Offering $13,500 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation friendly and open. 
* **Clear Expectations:** I'm being clear and direct about my expectations to avoid ambiguity. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I'm trying to secure a price closer to my desired $15,000, but still remaining within a reasonable range for Bob.
* **Maintaining Control:** I'm not giving in to Bob's pressure, but I'm also showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Utilizing Backup Offer:** I'm using John's offer as leverage to encourage Bob to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13200, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $13,200 is very close to my minimum value of $15,000.  
* **Limited Upside:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to get me much closer to my desired price. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer and meets my minimum requirement. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Selling to John ensures the highest possible profit in this scenario.
* **Minimize Risk:** Further negotiation with Bob carries the risk that he might walk away, leaving me with no sale at all. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Selling to John saves time and energy compared to continuing negotiations.

**Conclusion:**

While I would ideally like to reach a price closer to $15,000, it's more beneficial to secure the guaranteed sale to John and avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether."
