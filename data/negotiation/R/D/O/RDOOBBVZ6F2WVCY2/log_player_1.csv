"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Bargaining:** A price of $120 gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal while still leaving me some profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it's a signal that he's interested in the product. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $60 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial price, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $90 is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable to me, justifying my asking price.
* **Positive Tone:** Using positive language like ""good deal"" and ""happy to close"" reinforces a desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget. How about $75? That's a fair price, and it would allow me to get the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for Improvement:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's closer to my target.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** I have 6 rounds left, so I can afford to reject this offer and try to get a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:** I have the option to sell to John for $150, which is my minimum, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $85? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Progress:** I'm continuing to show flexibility by lowering my price, but I'm getting closer to my acceptable minimum.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I'm emphasizing ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Closing Pressure:** I'm subtly suggesting that this is the last chance for Bob to get the product from me.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
