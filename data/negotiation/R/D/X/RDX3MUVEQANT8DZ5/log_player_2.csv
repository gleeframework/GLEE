"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has tremendous potential and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is necessary.** There's room for a better price.  
* **Buying from John is worse.**  Even if you can't get a better price from Alice, John's offer is still higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** $1,200,000 is a good price for you, considering you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to get a much better price.**  While you could try to push for a lower price, it's possible Alice will stick to her ""lowest price"" stance. 
* **Buying from John is significantly more expensive.** You'd be paying an extra $300,000 for the same product. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous decision in this round."
