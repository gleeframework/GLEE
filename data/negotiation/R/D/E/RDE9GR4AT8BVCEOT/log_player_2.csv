"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better price than John's $10,000, you can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  There's room for both of you to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum value of $8,000. This shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal, while also leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your original offer of $8,500.  Since you have the option of buying from John for $10,000, you can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  It's worth pushing for a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing Alice you're willing to compromise while still striving for a better price. It's also a fair middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer. This increases the chances of Alice accepting, but still keeps you within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffers have been moving in the wrong direction, getting progressively higher. At this point, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to budge on her price. You've already attempted to negotiate and even increased your offer, but Alice seems determined to stick to her higher asking price.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate when you have a readily available alternative with John.  You are better off accepting John's offer of $10,000 to secure the product and avoid further haggling."
