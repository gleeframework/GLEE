Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
 ""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer price of $1,100,000 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), giving you room to negotiate.
    *  Attractive compared to your guaranteed sale price, motivating Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to decide quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. 
* Observe Bob's reaction to your offer. His response will provide valuable information for your next move."
