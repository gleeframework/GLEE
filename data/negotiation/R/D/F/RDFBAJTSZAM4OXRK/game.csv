"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
