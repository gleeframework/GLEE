Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a good deal for Bob to encourage acceptance, and keeping the tone friendly. 

This strategy balances the need to earn as much as possible while also considering the possibility of Bob rejecting my initial offer and engaging in further negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum threshold of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. 

I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price point by making a counteroffer, especially considering Bob's expressed interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $9,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still maintain a respectable price.
* **Message:** I'm reinforcing Bob's interest in the product and highlighting the fairness of my offer. I'm also using positive language (""fair price,"" ""happy"") to encourage acceptance.

This strategy balances being firm on my desired price while also showing flexibility to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to reconsider selling to John for the guaranteed $12,000, as further negotiations might not lead to a more profitable outcome."
