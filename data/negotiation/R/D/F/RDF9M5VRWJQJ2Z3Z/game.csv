,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $1,250,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,850,000?  This reflects the product's significant worth while acknowledging your interest.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $1,850,000 is still too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,450,000.  This is a significant step towards your asking price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  To show I'm serious about finding an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects the true value of this unique product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the concession, but $1,650,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and represents a significant step towards meeting your needs.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
