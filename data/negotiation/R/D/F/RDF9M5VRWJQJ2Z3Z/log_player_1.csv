"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential price ceiling. 
* **50% Markup:** The initial price of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from your minimum acceptable price. This is a significant increase, but not entirely unreasonable in a negotiation where both parties value the product.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed in a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own stated value for the product.  While his message suggests a willingness to negotiate, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if a mutually beneficial agreement can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $1,250,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,850,000?  This reflects the product's significant worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Stay Strong:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility by moving significantly down from the initial price. However, it remains above the midpoint between Bob's offer and your minimum, reinforcing the product's value.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (the product's ""significant worth"") helps justify the higher price and keeps the focus on objective value rather than just haggling.
* **Encouraging Movement:**  By proposing a price ""closer to the middle,"" you encourage Bob to make a similar concession in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $1,850,000 is still too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,450,000.  This is a significant step towards your asking price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, but you're still leaving $50,000 on the table. Since you have several rounds left and a guaranteed offer from John, it's strategically advantageous to see if you can negotiate a better deal with Bob. There's a chance he's willing to meet your minimum or at least come closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  To show I'm serious about finding an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects the true value of this unique product."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This offer drops the price by $200,000, a significant move that signals your willingness to negotiate.  However, it keeps the price firmly above your minimum acceptable amount. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the ""true value"" of the product emphasizes that your price isn't arbitrary and helps justify the remaining difference.
* **Time Consideration:**  While there are still a few rounds left, moving closer to your minimum now puts some pressure on Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial increase in his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the concession, but $1,650,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and represents a significant step towards meeting your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price and provides a $50,000 profit. While you could try to negotiate for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob might not be willing to go any higher. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
