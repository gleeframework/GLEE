"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $107.50 is still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  How about we split the difference one last time at $108.75? This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to finalize the transaction. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108.75.

You should buy the product from John.  You are willing to pay $100, and Alice is offering $108.75.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, you're now in a situation where you are risking paying more than you're comfortable with.  It's best to cut your losses and buy from John."
