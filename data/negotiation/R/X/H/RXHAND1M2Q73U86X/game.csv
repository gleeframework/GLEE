"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,750 is still a bit below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,125?  This is a fair price for both of us.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we need to find a price that works for both of us. I'd be willing to go up to $9,900. That's a significant move on my part, and I hope you can see I'm serious about buying.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,900 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider selling to someone else. ",10000.0,Alice,7,
