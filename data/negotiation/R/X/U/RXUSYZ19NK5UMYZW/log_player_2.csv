"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and John's offer. By rejecting this offer, you keep the door open for a better deal, either from Alice in a counter-offer or by proceeding with your option to buy from John."
