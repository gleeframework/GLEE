"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a product worth $1,000,000 to you at a significant discount. I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is enticing, it's still above your maximum value for the product. You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,180,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit while also being closer to your desired price. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your desired price. You have two options:

1. **Reject and counteroffer:**  You can try to negotiate further by offering a slightly higher price, perhaps $1,100,000. This shows your willingness to compromise while still keeping the price below your maximum.
2. **Buy from John:**  If you think the negotiation with Alice is going to be too lengthy or difficult, you can always buy from John for $1,000,000, which is your maximum budget. 

Since you have a backup option with John, there's less pressure to accept Alice's offer. It's worth attempting one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still above your maximum budget. While further negotiation is possible, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to drop below $1,150,000.  Given that you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's more efficient to take that route. 

Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks prolonging the process and potentially ending up with a higher price than John's offer. It's best to secure the product at your maximum budget and avoid the potential risks of further negotiation."
