"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,180,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit while also being closer to your desired price. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1180000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,180,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
