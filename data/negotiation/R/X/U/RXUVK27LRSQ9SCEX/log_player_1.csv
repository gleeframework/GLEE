"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it.  This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffer.  The price is above my minimum value, but it also gives me some room to potentially lower it later if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round.  I still have 9 rounds left, so there's time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly, to show continued flexibility. This is a significant concession from my initial offer but still keeps me above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to close the deal, as it's getting closer to his price range. If he rejects, I'm willing to consider selling to John, but I'm hoping to avoid that outcome."
