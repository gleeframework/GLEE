"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and it gives us both a fair deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking that $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go up to $1,075,000. I'm confident that this price will be a good deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
