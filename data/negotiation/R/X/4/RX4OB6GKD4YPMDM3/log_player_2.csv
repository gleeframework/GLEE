Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm close to my minimum price, and I'm willing to make a final concession.  How about $715,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it would be a very good deal for you.  Let's close this deal.

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer, and while we could try to push further, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of her walking away. This price is well below John's offer and represents a good deal."
