"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit,  but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $750,000?  This is a significant investment for you, and I want to make sure it's a win-win for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $700,000 is still a bit below my minimum. How about $725,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's still a great value for you considering the product's worth.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm close to my minimum price, and I'm willing to make a final concession.  How about $715,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it would be a very good deal for you.  Let's close this deal.",715000.0,Alice,7,
