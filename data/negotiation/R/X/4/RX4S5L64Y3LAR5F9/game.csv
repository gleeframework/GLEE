"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident this price is fair, considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price, considering the value I'll get out of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
