"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? I believe this is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to save as much as I can on this purchase.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, so I'll make an offer of $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
