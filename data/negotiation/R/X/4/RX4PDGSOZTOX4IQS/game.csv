"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $60 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  However, $105 is still a bit beyond my budget. Could you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $75 is cutting it close to my minimum, but I'm willing to accept $95.  This is my final offer.",95.0,Alice,5,
