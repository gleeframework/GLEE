"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is above your budget, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still out of my price range. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle at $900,000.  This is a substantial offer for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,
