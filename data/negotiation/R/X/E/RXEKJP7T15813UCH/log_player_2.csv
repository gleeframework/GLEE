"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is more than the product is worth to Alice, it's still less than the $120 you'd pay John. So, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for saving money."
