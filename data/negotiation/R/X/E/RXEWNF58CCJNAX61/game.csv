"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. My initial offer is $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to work with you, $850,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $925,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $875,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $875,000 just isn't enough for me.  Let's meet in the middle again.  How about we go with $900,000?  This is a fair price that takes into account both of our needs.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we need to find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle on $885,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal.",885000.0,Bob,6,
