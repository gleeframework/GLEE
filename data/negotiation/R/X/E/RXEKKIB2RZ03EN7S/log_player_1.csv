Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$9,000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a good value for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still not happy with that price. I'm going to see if I can push Bob a little further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to find a way to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.  I don't want to keep going back and forth."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200

I've reached the point where Bob's offers are getting too low for my comfort level.  I've tried to negotiate, but he's not budging much.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
