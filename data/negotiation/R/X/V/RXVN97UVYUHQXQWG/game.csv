"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $12,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  That would give you a good price and still allow me to get a fair amount for my product. Let me know what you think!",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your proposal, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. What do you think?",12750.0,Bob,4,
