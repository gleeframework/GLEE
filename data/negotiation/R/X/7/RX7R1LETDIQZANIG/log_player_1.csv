Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he wants to. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Maximum Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so I can't expect to get that full amount.
* **My Minimum:** I need at least $10,000 to make this worthwhile.
* **Leaving Room:**  Offering $14,000 allows for some potential negotiation if Bob wants to counter. 

This strategy balances getting the best possible price with ensuring that Bob has the incentive to negotiate and hopefully close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Selling to John:** While I could sell to John for $10,000, I believe there's still room for a better deal with Bob. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum, indicating there's still negotiation space.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and potentially get a better deal than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My previous offer of $14,000 was too high, as Bob countered at $12,000. This counteroffer represents a compromise, meeting Bob halfway.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $13,000 is still above my minimum price of $10,000, making it a profitable deal for me.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay closer to my desired price without completely cutting off negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer and I might end up with nothing. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit of $1,500, which is a reasonable outcome considering the negotiation process.

Although I would prefer a higher price, it's more prudent to secure the deal at this point and avoid further negotiation risks."
