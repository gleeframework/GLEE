# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer of $650,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand your desire to negotiate further, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to meet you exactly in the middle at $750,000. I'm willing to sell the product for $800,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?

Alice has come down to her lowest price and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome. Accepting the $800,000 offer secures a significant saving compared to John's price."
