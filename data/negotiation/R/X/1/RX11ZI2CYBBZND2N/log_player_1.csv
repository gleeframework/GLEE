I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000, but it allows room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counter, but I want to see if he's genuinely interested in the product at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to settle yet.  I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering Bob $1,350,000.  This is a compromise, moving closer to his offer but still leaving me with a good profit margin.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. While it's lower than I initially hoped for, it's still a significant profit and above my minimum threshold. I'm willing to accept this offer and finalize the sale."
