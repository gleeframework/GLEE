"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm starting with an offer of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $600,000 for the product.  Would that work for you?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives me a reasonable return while being a significant discount from my initial offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000? ",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $875,000? This is a significant discount for a product of this quality, and it's the closest I can come.",875000.0,Alice,5,
