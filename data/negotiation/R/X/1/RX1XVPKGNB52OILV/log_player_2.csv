"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm starting with an offer of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $600,000 for the product.  Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives me a reasonable return while being a significant discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000? "", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $875,000? This is a significant discount for a product of this quality, and it's the closest I can come. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some flexibility, her latest offer is still above your maximum budget and John's guaranteed price. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up with a worse deal.  You can secure the product right now for a better price by going with John."
