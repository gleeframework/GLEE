"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $2,250,000 is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's important to start negotiating from a strong position.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** The counteroffer is aggressive in terms of the initial price drop, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fair Starting Point:** $1,250,000 is a reasonable starting point considering Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but won't overpay. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes Bob's interest while clearly stating his price limit, setting the tone for a strong negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is reasonable, the value of this product to the right buyer is considerably higher.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to accept $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,900,000 is still beyond Bob's ideal budget.  It's important to keep pushing for a better deal.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer demonstrates Bob's commitment to finding a price that works for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,900,000 remains outside of my budget.  I'm confident that $1,500,000 is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product while allowing you to still make a substantial profit. Let's find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Focus on Common Ground:**  The message emphasizes finding a compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Clear & Confident:** Bob states his price point confidently and provides reasoning, showing he's not just throwing out a number.
* **Slightly Aggressive:**  The counteroffer is closer to Bob's ideal price but leaves room for Alice to come down a bit more.
* **Focus on Value:**  Bob emphasizes the value he sees in the product, while also reminding Alice that she will still profit significantly."
