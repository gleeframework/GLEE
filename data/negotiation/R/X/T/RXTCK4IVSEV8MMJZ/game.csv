"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to start with a price that reflects its true value. I'm offering it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to consider the value that this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice. Considering my budget and the current market situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9500.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to think about my costs and the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm counteroffering at $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10500, which I believe is fair considering the product's value and our previous discussions. This price aligns better with my budget while allowing you to maintain a reasonable profit margin.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to accept $10500, as it's not as high as I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. I'm counteroffering at $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I propose an offer of $11250 for the product. This price allows us to both feel satisfied with the transaction, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",11250.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $11250. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to think about my costs and the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm counteroffering at $12000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,9,
