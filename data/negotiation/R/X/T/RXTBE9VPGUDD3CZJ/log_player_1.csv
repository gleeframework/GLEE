This is a starting point, and I am aiming for a higher price than my minimum of $15,000. I'm starting with a significant markup to see if Bob is serious and what his budget might be."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $12,000 because it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a price that undervalues my product."

I'm offering a counteroffer of $17,000, which is still above my minimum value but represents a compromise from my initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to sell for a price that is too low."

I am rejecting Bob's offer of $14,000. While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."

I'm offering a counteroffer of $15,500. This is just above my minimum value and represents a significant concession from my previous offer. I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's previous offers and my desire to close the deal."
