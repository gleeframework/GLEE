It's a great deal for Bob, but he can likely get it for even less.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $850,000. What do you think?

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price for Bob considering his value of $1,200,000. It's a good deal for him and saves him a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
