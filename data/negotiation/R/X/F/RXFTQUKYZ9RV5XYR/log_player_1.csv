"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am interested, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. How about $17000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my asking price.  I'm going to try and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about $18,500?  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 18500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, how about $17500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and we're already on round 4.  It's risky to keep going, as I don't want to lose him as a buyer and end up selling to John for less.  I'll accept his offer."
