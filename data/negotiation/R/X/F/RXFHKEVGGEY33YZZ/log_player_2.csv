"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  Since your goal is to save money, rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

Starting with a counteroffer of $90 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing your desire to negotiate, but still within the realm of what you're willing to pay. This will give Alice a chance to adjust her price without feeling like you're completely disregarding her offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

Since Alice is willing to negotiate, we can try to increase our offer slightly, to see if we can reach a compromise. A counteroffer of $95 shows that we are serious about buying the product but still want a good deal. This is a good balance between being aggressive and being reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is continuing to lower her price, but it's still above your limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

This round, we need to be bold. It's time to go all in with your final offer. You've shown Alice you're serious about buying, and she's clearly willing to come down.  Offering $100 is your maximum, and it's your last chance before you default to John. Hopefully, Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is still unwilling to come down to your price point. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, you've reached your limit, and John offers a guaranteed price of $100. It's time to move on and secure the product for the best price available."
