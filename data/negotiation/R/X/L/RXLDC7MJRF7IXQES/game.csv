"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've done my research and understand that it's worth $800,000 to you. However, I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value to me, which is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the unique features of the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $650,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you consider $725,000?  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $725,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
