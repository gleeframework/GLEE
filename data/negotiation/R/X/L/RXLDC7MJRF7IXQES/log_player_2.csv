"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've done my research and understand that it's worth $800,000 to you. However, I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value to me, which is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $725,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John for $800,000."
