,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think $180 is a fair price, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $220. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere!",220.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $230. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",230.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go much lower, Bob. I'm thinking of my minimum acceptable price, and $230 is it. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package that's usually worth $50. So, I'm counteroffering at $230 for the product, and I'll throw in the service package for free. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere!",230.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. While I appreciate the additional service package, I believe we can still find common ground. I would like to counteroffer at $220 for the product only, without the service package.",220.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to give up the service package, Bob, but I understand you want to save some money. I'm willing to compromise on the price, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll sell the product to you for $225, and the premium service package is still included. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it!",225.0,Alice,9,
