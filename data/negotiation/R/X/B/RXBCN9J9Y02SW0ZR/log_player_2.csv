{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still higher than my budget. I'll continue negotiating to try and get a lower price.  I'm willing to risk losing the deal to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution, but $950,000 is still too far below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This represents a significant reduction from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I'm willing to risk pushing for a lower price, but if Alice doesn't budge, I'll be ready to buy from John at $800,000.  The value of the product to me is still significant, and I don't want to lose out on the opportunity altogether."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This price represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to me.  Let's reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
