"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to me. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value. Let's try to find a compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution, but $950,000 is still too far below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This represents a significant reduction from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This price represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to me.  Let's reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
