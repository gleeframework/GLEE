Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits of the product.  I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $950,000 is still more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $980,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 980000}"
