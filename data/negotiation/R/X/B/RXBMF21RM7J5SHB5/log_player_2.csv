You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is more than Bob's maximum price, and he can get the product for a lower price from John.  There's no point in accepting Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

Bob is offering $11,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still within Bob's budget and a potential profit for Alice. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He can get the product from John for $12,000, which is a better deal.  There's still room for negotiation with Alice, but Bob shouldn't rush into accepting a price that's above his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

Bob is offering $11,500. This is a slight increase from his previous offer, showing he's willing to compromise but still keeping the price within his budget. This move keeps the negotiation moving while also putting pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target price, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  There's a good chance Alice will lower her price further, and Bob shouldn't rush into a deal that's still above his desired price.  He can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

Bob is offering $12,500. This is a substantial increase from his previous offer, showing his commitment to getting the product from Alice. However, it's still below Alice's last offer and within Bob's budget, leaving room for potential compromise and a successful deal.  He's pushing the negotiation to its limit but staying within his own financial constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  He's already made multiple counteroffers and Alice seems unwilling to budge significantly. John is offering a price that's within Bob's budget, and there's no reason to keep negotiating with Alice when a better deal is readily available."
