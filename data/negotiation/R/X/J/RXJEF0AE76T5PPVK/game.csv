"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on a unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth $12,000 to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle on $11,250? This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.
