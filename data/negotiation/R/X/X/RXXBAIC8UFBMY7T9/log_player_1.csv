Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $120 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he really wants the product, potentially allowing me to earn even more.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While I could start at $120, it might make Bob less likely to engage in negotiation. 

This strategy aims to balance securing a good profit with the possibility of Bob accepting the offer outright."
