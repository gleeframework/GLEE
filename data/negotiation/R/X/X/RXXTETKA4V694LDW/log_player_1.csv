"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't let this go for that low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit high. I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000. It's the best I can do, and if you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $8,000 offer.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a better outcome. It's time to take John's offer and avoid wasting more time."
