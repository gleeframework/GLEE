"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is $80. Let's start with that and see if we can find a middle ground.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for this unique product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $110 is still out of my budget.  Let's try $90. That's a good compromise for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we try $105? I'm willing to give you a bit more flexibility, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to split the difference at $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $95, Bob. But I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $95. How about we try $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can finalize the deal here.",100.0,Alice,7,
