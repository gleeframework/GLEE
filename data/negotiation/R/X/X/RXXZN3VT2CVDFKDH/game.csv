,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $14000? It's still a great price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, how about $13750? This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,5,
