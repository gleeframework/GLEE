Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being positive and enthusiastic, highlighting the value of the product for Bob.  
* **Strategy:** By starting with a high offer, I'm aiming to secure a good price while leaving space for negotiation if necessary. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price a bit further, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, I'm only able to pay $8000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $12,000, it's still worth considering. However, I'm going to reject his offer for now and try to secure a better price.  

* **Reasoning:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob clearly values the product at $8,000, and I can likely get a price closer to my minimum value by making a counteroffer. 
* **Next Step:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $10,000. If he rejects again, I can still sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to consider a price closer to the middle ground.  How about $9,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $9,500, which is halfway between my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,000). This demonstrates flexibility and shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer, stating my willingness to compromise, and highlighting the fairness of my new offer. 
* **Strategy:** By offering a compromise, I'm aiming to reach an agreement quickly while still securing a price closer to my minimum value. If Bob rejects, I still have the option to sell to John, but I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him."
