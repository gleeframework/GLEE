"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value the product at a higher price point, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. Let's try to close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
