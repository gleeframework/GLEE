Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $850,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to meet my minimum price to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $850,000 and $1,200,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,025,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.

Round 5

I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,025,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $962,500. This is my final compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.

Alice seems firmly set on a price above John's offer.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly better than what John is offering. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
