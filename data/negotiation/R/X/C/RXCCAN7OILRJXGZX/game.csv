"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being open to negotiation. While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still a touch high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,000,000? That's a fair offer, and it would allow me to make the purchase today.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is really pushing the lower limits of what I can accept for this product.  It's truly valuable, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment. Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
