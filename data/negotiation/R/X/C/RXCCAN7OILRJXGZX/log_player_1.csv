Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being open to negotiation. While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still a touch high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,000,000? That's a fair offer, and it would allow me to make the purchase today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Bob has reached his maximum valuation. It's time to push him a bit more to see if we can get a higher price before resorting to John."
