"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's true value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
