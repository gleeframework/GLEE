# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.

# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation.  It's time to cut bait and buy from John for a guaranteed good deal."
