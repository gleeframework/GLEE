"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts by building a friendly rapport with Bob and then presents a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable offer of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. It is important to start high and leave space for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. I'm willing to go up to $90 for the product.  That's a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my maximum.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's getting closer to the $100 I initially asked.  I'll accept the offer and close the deal."
