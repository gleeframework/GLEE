"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is her starting price and it's the maximum you would ever pay. It's always better to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal, especially since you have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a significantly lower offer than you're willing to pay. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a good deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will give us a sense of how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have John as a backup option at $1,000,000, so there's no pressure to accept a price we're not comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,000,000, which is the midpoint between my original price and your offer. Would you be interested in accepting this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Our Backup:** Alice has come down to our exact backup price with John. There's no point in rejecting this offer and potentially missing out on the product or having to go through more negotiation rounds. 
* **Saving Money:** While we didn't get it below $1,000,000, we've successfully negotiated down from her initial $1,200,000 asking price."
