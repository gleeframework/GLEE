"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it. However, $170 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $155. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $155 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $130. If you're not willing to budge, I'll have to look at other options.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $130, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $142.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $142.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to buy from someone else.",135.0,Bob,6,
