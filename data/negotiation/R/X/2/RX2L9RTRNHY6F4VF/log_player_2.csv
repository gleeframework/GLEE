"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it very profitable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your maximum price. It's clear there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product.  I believe it's a fair starting point considering its value to me."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $800,000, I want to start significantly lower to leave room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** Offering $500,000 first sets a lower anchor point for the negotiation, potentially influencing Alice to consider lower prices. 
* **Alternative:** I have John as a backup option at $800,000, so I'm not desperate to accept any price Alice throws my way."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $500,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value this product holds for you,  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This still leaves you with a substantial profit margin. Let's find a way to make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  $1,200,000 is better than her first offer but still significantly above my $800,000 limit and way above a fair price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice dropping her price suggests she's willing to negotiate. I'll continue bargaining to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.
* **Backup Option:**  I'm not feeling pressured to accept a bad deal because I can still buy from John for $800,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $700,000? That's a significant price for the product and gives us both something to work with."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I've raised my offer considerably to show Alice I'm serious about a deal, but I'm still within a reasonable distance from my $800,000 maximum.
* **Middle Ground:**  Suggesting $700,000 frames the negotiation as finding a mutually beneficial compromise, rather than a one-sided win.
* **Time Constraint:**  We have limited rounds, so I'm getting closer to my limit while encouraging Alice to make a move within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $700,000 simply isn't enough for me. Let's aim for something in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. It's a fair price for both of us and ensures a profitable deal for you.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Alice is coming down, the pace is slow. We're still $200,000 apart, and I want to see if I can get her closer to my range.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right, even though it's getting closer to a point where I might concede.
* **John Option:** I still have the fallback option of buying from John, keeping me from feeling pressured to accept a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving on the price.  To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum budget for this is $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. If not, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm revealing my maximum budget to show Alice I'm serious and at my limit. This might encourage her to make a final decision.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning that I might have to explore other options adds a bit of time pressure, potentially pushing Alice to close the deal.
* **Respectful but Firm:** I'm maintaining a polite and respectful tone while clearly stating my position and the potential consequences of not reaching an agreement."
