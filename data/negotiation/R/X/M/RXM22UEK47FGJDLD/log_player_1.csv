Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,750,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher asking price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  A price of $1,750,000 signals that you understand the product's worth and are aiming for a premium. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob to share his thoughts, indicating a willingness to discuss the price further.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know about your guaranteed offer from John. If he did, your bargaining power would be significantly reduced.
* Gauging Bob's interest level and potential budget throughout the negotiation will be crucial to securing the highest possible price."
