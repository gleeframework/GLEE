"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $13,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be happy to purchase it for $11,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12500. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but I can't go any lower. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,500 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate further. He's already successfully countered Alice's offer once and can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but I'm really hoping we can close the deal at that price.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
