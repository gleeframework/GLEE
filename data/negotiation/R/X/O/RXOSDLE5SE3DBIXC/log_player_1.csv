"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for potential negotiation and allows for some wiggle room. I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $850,000. This is a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum threshold of $800,000 and reflects some progress in the negotiation. While I would have preferred a higher price, continuing to negotiate risks reaching a stalemate and losing the sale altogether."
