"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value this product brings.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're serious about buying this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $13,000, so I'll offer it to you for $14,500. This is my final compromise, but I think it's a great deal for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob! I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $14,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. I'm not going any lower than this, but I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",14000.0,Alice,7,
