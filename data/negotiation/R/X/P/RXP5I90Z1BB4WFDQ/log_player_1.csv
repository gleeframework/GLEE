Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $120. I believe it's a great deal, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
At this point, accepting Bob's offer of $85 is the best choice. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $85 is still a profit over your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or offering even less. John's offer is a safety net, not a target to beat. 

It's always good to push for a higher price initially, but knowing when to accept a reasonable offer is key to successful negotiation.
