"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what the product is worth to Bob, it's still above what Alice needs to sell it for.  Bob has 10 rounds and can leverage this to try and get a better price. Rejecting the offer will allow Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's important to start with a counteroffer that is clearly below what Bob is willing to pay, but still above what Alice wants to sell for. This establishes a negotiating range and hopefully prompts Alice to counter with a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15000 to you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room to negotiate.  Bob has 7 rounds remaining and can continue to try and drive the price down. By rejecting the offer, Bob can counter with a price closer to his target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now increasing his offer, showing his willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good price. $10,500 is a reasonable middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer. This move shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but also values getting a fair deal."
