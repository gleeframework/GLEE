Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
