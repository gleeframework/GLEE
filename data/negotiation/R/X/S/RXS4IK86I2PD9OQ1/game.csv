"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's still a good price for you, and it's fair for me.  What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $160 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you do $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $130 is just not workable for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $145.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable.  Let's close this deal.",145.0,Alice,5,
