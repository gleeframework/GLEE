"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product for $9,000. It's still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,250. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is still a good deal for you and gets me closer to my target. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",8000.0,Alice,7,
