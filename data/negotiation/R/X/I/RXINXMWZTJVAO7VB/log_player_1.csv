I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we bring the price down to $600,000? I believe it's a fair offer considering its value in my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
