"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm confident that you'll find this price reasonable, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we bring the price down to $600,000? I believe it's a fair offer considering its value in my business.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I've done some research and I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I've made a significant concession by moving from $1,200,000 to $900,000 and then to $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. Can we discuss further?",850000.0,Alice,5,
