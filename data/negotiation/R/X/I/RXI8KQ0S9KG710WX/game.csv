"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,000? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get a fair return on my investment. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $12,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
