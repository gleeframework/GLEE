"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to maximize my savings. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your offer, and while I understand your desire to maximize savings, the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.  What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This price would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your understanding of the product's value.  While $1,350,000 is tempting, I have to be realistic about the potential I'm offering.  How about we settle on $1,362,500?  This represents a significant move on my part and feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1362500.0,Alice,5,
