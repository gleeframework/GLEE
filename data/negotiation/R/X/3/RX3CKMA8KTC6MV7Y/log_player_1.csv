"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,150,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm going to split the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping he'll see that this is a fair price and accept."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,075,000 is a lot closer to what John will pay, I'm still hoping to get a little more from Bob.  We're getting down to the wire, but I think I can still push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Since we're in round 5 and Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, I'm going to meet him halfway on his last offer. This will give him a slightly better deal than his previous offer, but still allows me to secure a higher price than I'd get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to John's offer, I'm still going to try and squeeze a little more out of him. We only have four rounds left, and I'm not giving up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

With only four rounds left, I'm going to make a small concession, but still try to secure a price that's higher than John's offer. I'm meeting Bob halfway on his last offer, hoping he'll recognize that this is a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer is getting too close to John's.  I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to secure a decent profit than risk getting nothing."
