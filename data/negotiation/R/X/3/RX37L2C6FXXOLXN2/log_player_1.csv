I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me. This is because I want to maximize my profit and I believe there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will counteroffer in the next round to try and reach a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale."
