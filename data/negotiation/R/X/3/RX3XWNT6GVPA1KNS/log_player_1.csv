"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,700,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is a good profit, I believe there's still room to push for a higher price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1,675,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1675000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $1,675,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000 is too high, I'd be willing to go up to $1,625,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,625,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has increased his offer again, showing commitment to the deal.  While we might be able to squeeze out a bit more in subsequent rounds, $1,625,000 is a strong profit margin and a sure thing. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob decreasing his offer or the negotiation stalling."
