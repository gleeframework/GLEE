"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, there's potential for Alice to be willing to sell for less.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (20% off) is a common negotiation tactic. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and sets a strong starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's ideal price.  Accepting the offer at $11,000 saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and potentially increasing her price is present.  It's a good compromise to secure the product at a discounted price."
