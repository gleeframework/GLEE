"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $10500, which is still a good price for you, considering your valuation. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal at this price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
