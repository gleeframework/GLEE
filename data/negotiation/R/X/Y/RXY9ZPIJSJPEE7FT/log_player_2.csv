"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better by negotiating. It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a good price for you, considering your valuation. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  While he could potentially continue negotiating, it's becoming riskier to keep rejecting offers. If he rejects again, Alice may become less flexible, and he might end up having to buy from John for $12,000.  Accepting Alice's offer at $11,000 ensures a good price and saves Bob from further negotiation."
