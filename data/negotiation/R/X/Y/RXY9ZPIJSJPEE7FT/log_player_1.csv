"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $10500, which is still a good price for you, considering your valuation. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,500 is too low."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
