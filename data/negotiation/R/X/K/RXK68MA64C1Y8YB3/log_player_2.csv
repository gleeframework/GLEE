# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can potentially get a better price than $100 from her."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to go a little lower, but $105 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference - I'll do $110. That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

You're still closer to your target price of $100. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice down a bit further."
