,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to go a little lower, but $105 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference - I'll do $110. That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's meet in the middle, and we can both be happy with the deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
