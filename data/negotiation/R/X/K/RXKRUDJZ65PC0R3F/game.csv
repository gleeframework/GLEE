"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. Can you meet me at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't cover my costs for this unique product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,275,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal. Can you consider that offer?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,275,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to move forward with the transaction.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both agree on.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement. Can you meet me at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
