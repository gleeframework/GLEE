"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $800,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",850000.0,Alice,5,
