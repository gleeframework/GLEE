"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll try negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer that's closer to Alice's value of the product. This might encourage her to negotiate, but there's still room for me to go up if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but I think I can still get it lower. I'll reject this offer and counter with something between $70 and $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $78?"", 
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

I'm offering a price slightly above my initial offer, signaling that I'm willing to compromise. This price point is still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and her current offer, giving me some bargaining power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but I'm not comfortable going below $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $81. That's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $80, which is her value for the product. Accepting at $81 is a good deal for me and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
