,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me, and I believe we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob, and I'm glad you see the value in the product. However, $700,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $825,000. I think this price is fair considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $825,000 is still slightly higher than my maximum budget. I'm prepared to offer $775,000.  This price acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints.  I'm confident that we can close the deal with this offer.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $775,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $810,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value this product, $810,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer $790,000. This is a very fair price, and I'm sure you'll find it agreeable. I'm eager to close this deal, and I believe this offer demonstrates my seriousness.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're serious about closing the deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $790,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $820,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",820000.0,Alice,7,
