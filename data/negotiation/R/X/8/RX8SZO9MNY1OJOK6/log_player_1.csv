Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest level.  If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, you can negotiate down towards your minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
