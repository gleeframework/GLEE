"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $900000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000 to make this deal work. This reflects the product's significant value while leaving room for further discussion. Let's keep the conversation going.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
