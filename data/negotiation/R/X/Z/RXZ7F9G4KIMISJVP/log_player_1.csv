{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is a good compromise between what the product is worth to you and Bob.  It leaves room for potential counteroffers and still gives you a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial counter, it's still below my minimum price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $10,000,  $9,200 is a good compromise.  It's a significant profit for me, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by rejecting Bob's offer and potentially going back and forth further."
