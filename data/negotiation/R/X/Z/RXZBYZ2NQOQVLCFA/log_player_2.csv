"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true worth, we're offering it to you for $95. This is an excellent opportunity to secure a valuable item at a reasonable price. We look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product.  Alice is offering it for $95, which is still more than you are willing to pay.  You can get the same product from John for $100, so it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
