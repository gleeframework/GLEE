Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a significant profit margin for Alice ($300,000 above her minimum) and still offers Bob a substantial discount compared to John's offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning the offer is exclusive and time-limited, we encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
