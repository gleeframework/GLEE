Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, though, and I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?

You have three options:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, he's still $2,000 away from my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll reach that point, and further negotiation might not be worth the time and potential to lose John's offer."
