"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!  If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is trying to sell the product above her own valuation ($11,500 vs. $10,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* You have a backup option with John at $12,000.  
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal you're not willing to pay that much.  She might come back with a lower price, closer to her $10,000 valuation. 

**It's important to note:** There's a risk Alice might stick to her price or sell to someone else. However, the potential savings of getting the product for less than $11,500 makes it worth the risk in this scenario."
