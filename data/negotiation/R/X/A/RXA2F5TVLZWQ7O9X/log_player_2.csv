"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further.  There's a good chance you can get the price lower than $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting by offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and helps to set the stage for a back-and-forth.  The price of $800,000 is still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, accepting her offer of $850,000 saves me $150,000 compared to buying from John. This is a significant savings and likely worth the risk of not getting a slightly lower price through further negotiation."
