"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7,500. Let's see if we can make a deal!",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise at $7,500, but I'll throw in a small concession - I'll include a premium service package worth $500. So, the total price would be $8,000, but I'll give you the service package for free. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
