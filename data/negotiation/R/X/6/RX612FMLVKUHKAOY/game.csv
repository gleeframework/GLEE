"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1400000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you consider going lower than $1400000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $800000, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you a price of $1100000, which is a significant discount from my previous offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping you'll find it acceptable.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be realistic about what I can afford. Can you consider $900000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can offer you a price of $1000000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
