Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob. I'll be watching closely to see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd prefer to sell to him for a better price, his offer is unacceptable. I will counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair compromise.  If he rejects it, I'm ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still not close to my minimum price.  I'm going to sell to John for $12,000. While I would have preferred to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price."
