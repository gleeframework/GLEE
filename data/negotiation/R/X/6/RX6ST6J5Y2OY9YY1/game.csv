"Alice, I appreciate your offer.  While the product seems valuable, $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1050000. This would represent a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1075000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
