"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  A counteroffer gives Bob a chance to save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a considerable return on your investment. What do you say?

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than Bob's desired price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
