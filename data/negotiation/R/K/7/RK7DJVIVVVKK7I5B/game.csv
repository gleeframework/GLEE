"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway and offering the product for $1600000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product for $1520000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1520000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable with $1520000. I'm willing to meet you at $1450000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on a price.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $1450000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $1500000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",1500000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm afraid I've already made my final offer, Alice. I'm not willing to pay more than $1450000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
