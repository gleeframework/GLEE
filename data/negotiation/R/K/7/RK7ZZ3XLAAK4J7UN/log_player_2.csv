"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for your needs. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I know it holds significant value for you as well. I'm offering it to you at a price of $850,000. This gives you a chance to acquire it at a potentially advantageous rate, while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget and you know John will sell it for less.  There's no point in negotiating with Alice."
