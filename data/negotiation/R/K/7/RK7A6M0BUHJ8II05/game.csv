"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? That's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,300,000, which is $1,200,000. That's the best I can do.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
