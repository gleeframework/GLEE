**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to come down gracefully while still maximizing her profit.  At $845,000, you're saving a significant amount compared to both her starting price and John's offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a much better result, and you risk Alice taking the deal off the table entirely."
