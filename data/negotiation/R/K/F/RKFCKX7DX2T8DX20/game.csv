"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,800,000 is tempting, I'm confident this product has the potential to yield even greater returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects its true value and allows us both to benefit significantly.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's potential, but I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,900,000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
