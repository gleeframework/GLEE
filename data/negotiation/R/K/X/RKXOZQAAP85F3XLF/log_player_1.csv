Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, so you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** By emphasizing the product's ""value and potential"" and calling it a ""unique chance,"" you aim to increase Bob's perceived value beyond $1,000,000.
* **Anchor Price:** Starting with a high offer of $1,500,000 sets an anchor.  Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price significantly higher than your guaranteed sale price.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, you would likely engage in multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers to find a mutually agreeable price."
