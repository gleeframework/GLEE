"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $12,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it still gives you some room to negotiate. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,500. How about $12,250? It's a fair compromise that I think we can both agree on.",12250.0,Bob,4,
