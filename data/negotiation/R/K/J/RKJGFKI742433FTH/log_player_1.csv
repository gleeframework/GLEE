Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000, knowing it's likely more than Bob is willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm signaling flexibility to encourage Bob to counteroffer.
* **John as a backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm only willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm making a counter-offer that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not to accept his first offer. 
* **Reasoning:**  By going down to $13,500, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise. If Bob's counteroffer was a serious attempt, he might be willing to meet me in the middle. 
* **Keeping options open:** If Bob still rejects, I can either lower my price further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's final offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, which means further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price.
* **Close to minimum:** While $12,500 isn't ideal, it's only $500 below my minimum acceptable price ($10,000).
* **Risk of selling to John:** Selling to John would only net me $10,000, so taking this offer from Bob guarantees a slightly higher profit.

Given these factors, it's more advantageous to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
