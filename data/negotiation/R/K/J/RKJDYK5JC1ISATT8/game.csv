"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $900,000. It's a one-time opportunity to acquire a truly unique item.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm prepared to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm getting closer.  How about $800,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the purchase.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $820,000? It's a compromise that works for both of us.",820000.0,Alice,5,
