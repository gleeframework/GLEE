"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $900,000. It's a one-time opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $900,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm prepared to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $825,000 is closer to your target, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can likely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm getting closer.  How about $800,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $820,000? It's a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still above your target. At this point, it's better to cut your losses and purchase the product from John for $800,000. You've already spent several rounds negotiating, and you're unlikely to get Alice to accept your offer with only a few rounds remaining."
