"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $11,000 is closer to my budget, I still believe we can find a better compromise. Could you consider $10,500 for the product?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm open to finding a compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I think is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
