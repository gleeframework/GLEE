Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest, $700,000 is too far off from what I had in mind. I can go down to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute limit."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your limit, but it's still a bit rich for me.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

While it's less than my ideal price, $975,000 is a reasonable compromise and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely by pushing for more."
