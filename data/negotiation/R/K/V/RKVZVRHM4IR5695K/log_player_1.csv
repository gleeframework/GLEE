Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too far below my minimum price point, and I believe I can still get a better offer from Bob or sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a good deal considering the value you've mentioned, and it's the lowest I can go at this time. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,025,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $1,025,000 is a good price, and while I could potentially get more with further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to Bob or needing to sell to John for less is not worth it. It's better to secure the sale now."
