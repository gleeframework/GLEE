"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1250000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below what I would receive from another buyer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product from John for $1,000,000. Even though Alice is offering a lower price than what she'd get elsewhere, it's still higher than what Bob can get it for. Bob should reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save $250,000."
