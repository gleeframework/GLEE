Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."",
 ""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price well above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value specifically to Bob, increasing the chances of him accepting the high price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a more aggressive initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a multi-round negotiation, the approach might change based on Bob's responses."
