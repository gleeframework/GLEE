"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This sets a high baseline and gives me room to negotiate downwards. I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum of $1,200,000 within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better deal with further negotiation. I want to see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,300,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired minimum.  I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, even if it's a slight increase. With several rounds left, I'm not ready to settle for that. I believe I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm now offering the product for my minimum price. I'm confident that Bob will accept as he knows the product is worth more to him than this. If he rejects, I will be ready to sell to John for the same price.  This final offer puts the pressure on him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a critical point. Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and with only a few rounds left, the risk of not getting my desired price is high. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to take the chance of getting less than my minimum. Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit."
