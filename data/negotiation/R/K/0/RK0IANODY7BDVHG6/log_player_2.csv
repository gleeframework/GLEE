"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $12,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your budget, but I've already gone lower than my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal, and it's likely Alice won't go lower.  Accepting the offer is the best option to secure the product at a good price."
