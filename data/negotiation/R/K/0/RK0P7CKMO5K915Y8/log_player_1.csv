"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd be willing to accept from John, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to consider, given his perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the ""unique opportunity"" and ""true worth"" aims to create a sense of urgency and emphasize the product's value. 

This strategy sets the stage for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counter-offer, keeping in mind the potential deal with John as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to acquire your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit. While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my target and below what John is willing to pay.
* **Negotiation:** I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer signals that I'm not desperate and opens the door for further negotiation.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll counter with a price closer to $1,000,000, aiming to meet halfway. If he rejects again, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. While $900,000 is a good starting point,  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to show my commitment to this deal. This price reflects the unique features and potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm reducing my price from the initial $1,200,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:**  $1,050,000 is still a better deal than John's offer of $1,000,000, giving me some room for further bargaining if needed.
* **Framing:** Emphasizing the ""unique features"" and ""potential"" reinforces the product's value and creates a sense of opportunity for Bob.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and entice Bob to come closer to my desired price. If he rejects, I'll reassess and potentially consider selling to John, especially if the next rounds are approaching."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the features of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting very close to John's offer of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting, it's still below my target of at least $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Higher Counter:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a slightly higher price, aiming to bridge the gap further. 
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,000,000. But, if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob, I'd prefer to do so.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to secure a price that's closer to my goal and potentially a little above John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $975,000. This is a fair price considering the unique value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm only increasing my offer by $25,000, showing a genuine attempt to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Staying Above John:**  This price still offers me a higher profit than selling to John. 
* **Urgency:** Emphasizing ""closing the deal"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to finalize the agreement.

This counteroffer is strategically designed to be a final nudge towards an agreement. If Bob rejects again, I will seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Decreasing Offers:** Bob's offer is now lower than my last counteroffer, indicating a trend of decreasing offers.
* **Approaching John's Offer:**  We're very close to the price John is offering, which is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  There's a significant risk that further negotiations won't lead to a better price. 

Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,000,000.  While I'd ideally like to secure a higher price, the risk of Bob continuing to lower his offers and the limited time left make selling to John the more prudent option at this point."
