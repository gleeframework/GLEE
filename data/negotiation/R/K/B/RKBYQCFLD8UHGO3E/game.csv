"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $9000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9000 is still higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $8750. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget. Let's work towards a mutually agreeable price.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $9000, but this is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to close the deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
