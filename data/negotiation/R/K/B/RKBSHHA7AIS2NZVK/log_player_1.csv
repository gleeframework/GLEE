"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but not so high as to be immediately rejected. It leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $150 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $170.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit above my minimum.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $145 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $160. This is another compromise, but I'm still aiming for a good profit.  With only five rounds left, I need to find a price that Bob is willing to pay while still meeting my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm starting to run out of time, I'm not going to settle for $140 yet. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price. If it fails, I'll likely have to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

This is my final offer. I'm going to meet Bob halfway at $150. This is still a decent profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept. If he doesn't, I'll have to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of time and Bob is not budging much. It's getting risky to keep negotiating, and I'm close to my minimum. I'll accept John's offer to avoid losing more money."
