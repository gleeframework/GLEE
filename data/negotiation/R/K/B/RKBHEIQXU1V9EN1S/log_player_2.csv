"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a good price, but I want to see if I can get it lower. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Alice and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if she doesn't come down.  It also leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice increased her offer, but it's still higher than my initial counteroffer. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price. There's still room to bargain, and I'm not ready to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $450,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still firm in my desire to get a better price than her initial offer. I'm aiming for a middle ground, and with 6 rounds left, there's still time for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting worse, but I'm still not ready to give up on negotiating. I've seen her willingness to counter, and I believe I can still bring her down closer to my target price.  With 5 rounds remaining, I have enough time to continue exploring a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 475000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is stubbornly high, but I'm sticking to my strategy of gradual increases in my counteroffers. I'm raising my offer to $475,000, which is closer to her last offer while still being significantly lower than her current one.  With 4 rounds left, I'm hoping to find a middle ground.  I'm still not ready to buy from John, as there's potential to get a better price from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer keeps increasing, indicating she's not budging much.  We're down to 3 rounds left, and I'm starting to run out of time.  I'm not confident I can get Alice to accept a price closer to my target in the remaining rounds.  At this point, it's more reasonable to buy from John for $1,000,000 rather than risk getting stuck with a higher price from Alice."
