Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $170.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob's valuation is lower than mine, it's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than his perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (""because I think you'll find it valuable"") can make the offer seem more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for John:** It's crucial to price it below John's offer ($150) to ensure I'm not losing potential profit if Bob declines.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests I'm open to discussing the price, making Bob more likely to counter-offer rather than just rejecting outright."
