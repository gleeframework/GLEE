"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay up to $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I can accept right now.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal happen.  This price still reflects the true value of the product, and it allows for a win-win situation for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet you at $1,100,000. My final offer is $1,075,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. My final offer is $1,090,000. This is as low as I can go while still ensuring I get a fair value for my product.  I think this is a good compromise that benefits both of us.  What do you say?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
