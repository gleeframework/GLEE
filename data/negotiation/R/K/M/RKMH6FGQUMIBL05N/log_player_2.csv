"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can still do better.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm still looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  How about $11,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $10,000 limit. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his target.  There's still room for negotiation, so he should reject and counteroffer again."
