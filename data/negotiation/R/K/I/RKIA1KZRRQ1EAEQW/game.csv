"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your price of $1200000. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1250000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll gain from acquiring this product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm afraid $1250000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm not looking to overpay, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1225000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your understanding, Alice, but I'm afraid $1225000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay the lowest price you mentioned earlier, which is $1200000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. I'm not interested in going back and forth anymore, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
