"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  He should reject the offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I could meet you halfway. How about $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. At $120, the product is within Bob's budget and a good deal. There's a good chance he can get a better price in the next round, but risking it might lead to a higher price or a deal with John at $150. Accepting the offer is the safest choice."
