Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $150.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $150 offer represents a 50% markup, which is a significant profit margin. While a higher price is tempting, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and your willingness to sell, making it more appealing to Bob. 

This strategy balances profit maximization with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
