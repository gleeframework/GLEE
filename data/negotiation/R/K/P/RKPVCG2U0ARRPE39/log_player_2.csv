"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is above his maximum budget, so accepting the offer is not a good option. Buying from John immediately would get him the product for his maximum price, but there's still a chance he can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting by making a bold counteroffer. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price significantly lower than that. This is a strategic move to test the waters and see how much Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  He's still hoping to negotiate a better price and is willing to risk a few more rounds to achieve his goal.  Buying from John right now would guarantee him the product, but there's still a chance he can get it for less from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering Alice's minimum price. He knows he can buy the product from John for this amount, but he's willing to take one more risk to see if Alice will accept his offer. He's showing Alice that he's serious about getting the product, and he's prepared to walk away if she's not willing to meet him halfway."
