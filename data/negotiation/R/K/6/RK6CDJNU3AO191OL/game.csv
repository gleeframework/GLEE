"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm serious about buying this product, but I do have a firm budget in mind. Would you be willing to consider $980,000? I feel this is a fair offer that respects the value of your product.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but $980,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one last push. I can offer you the product for $1,020,000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
