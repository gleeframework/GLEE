Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring a profitable outcome for me. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for your product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profitable margin.  I'm also reiterating the value of the product to emphasize the fairness of my counteroffer."
