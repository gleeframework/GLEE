"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  That's a substantial discount from my original offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I think that's a reasonable compromise considering the value it offers and the price I'm willing to pay.",13500.0,Bob,4,
