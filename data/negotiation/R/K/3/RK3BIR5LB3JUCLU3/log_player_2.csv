"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that is significantly less. I'm asking for $9,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While you value the product at $10,000, Alice is offering it for $9,000. This saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **It's worth the risk:** You know the product is worth at least $8,000 to Alice, so there's a margin for negotiation. You're likely getting a good deal."
