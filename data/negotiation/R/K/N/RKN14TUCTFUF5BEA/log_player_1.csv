Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you can afford to start the negotiation with Bob at a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is $10,000, it hints at the product's value. This approach aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher point.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  If Bob outright rejects the $10,000, you have the option to lower the price slightly in a subsequent offer, still aiming for a price above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  The ideal offer can be influenced by factors like your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style and how much you prioritize a quick sale."
