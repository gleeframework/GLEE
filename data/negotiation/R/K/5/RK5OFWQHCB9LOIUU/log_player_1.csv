"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product, but I was thinking it's a bit high. Can you meet me at $16,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $16,000 is a good price, I think I can get closer to my target price of $18,000. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to come down that low yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this is still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering it's worth $15,000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still holding out for a higher price. Even though Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can get him to go a little higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. But I'm still confident the product is worth more than $15,500 to you. How about we settle for $16,500? This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to the value you've already acknowledged. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16500}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We've been going back and forth for a while now, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. While I'd prefer a higher price, $16,000 is a good compromise and a significant profit for me."
