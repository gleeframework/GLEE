"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $105? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents good value for you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While $105 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the best I can do. Can you consider this offer?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and $95 is getting closer. But I still need a bit more to make this work for me.  How about $100? That's my bottom line, and it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
