"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to start negotiations with a strong offer that's favorable to you. This leaves room for potential concessions later.
* **Not Too High:** While we value the product at $1,200,000,  an extremely high opening price (like $1,500,000) might discourage Bob entirely. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""unique value and potential,"" we provide a subtle justification for the high price. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:** Set a high reference point for the negotiation.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will give us valuable information about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand your perspective. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value of $800,000, indicating a strong interest in the product. However, it's still considerably below our minimum acceptable price. We have room to negotiate and try to close the gap. Selling to John right now would mean losing out on a potentially better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value. While your offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise, acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're lowering our asking price by $50,000, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Holding Ground:** We're not meeting Bob in the middle yet. Our new price aims to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired outcome.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and potentially nudge Bob upwards.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain Momentum:** Keep the negotiation moving forward without conceding too much too quickly.
* **Test Bob's Limit:** See how much further he's willing to go to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered Alice's latest offer and would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant win for us. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** We're securing a profit of $200,000 over our minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations where Bob might lower his offer or walk away. 
* **Bird in Hand:** We have a guaranteed offer on the table.  While there's a chance of getting closer to $1,200,000 in further rounds, it's not worth risking the current offer. 

Accepting $1,000,000 represents a strong balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
