"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,750,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still quite a way off from what I had in mind.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,625,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the product's value.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
