"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $13,000 is too low, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15,500? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,250. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $14,250 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher amount. I'm not quite ready to settle for that price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  While I value your interest in the product, $14,250 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $14,750. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I'd like to get more, I've gone through several rounds of negotiation with Bob and it seems he's not willing to go higher. I don't want to risk losing a deal entirely.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price."
