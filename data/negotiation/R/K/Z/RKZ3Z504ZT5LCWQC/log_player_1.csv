"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential counteroffers without immediately going too low.  I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $12,000, so I have a good backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with, and selling to John would be a much better financial outcome. However, I want to explore if there's any room for negotiation with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. This is my final offer - if we can't agree on this, I'll be selling to someone else."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground by lowering my price slightly but still maintaining a significant profit margin. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer to create pressure and potentially encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still thinking $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $9,000. This is my final offer, and I'd appreciate it if you could consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still lower than I'd prefer, but it's a significant improvement from his previous offer. It's also close to my counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob by pushing further.  Selling to John would be more profitable, but I want to prioritize making a deal with Bob first."
