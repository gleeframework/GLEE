"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. This is my final offer - if we can't agree on this, I'll be selling to someone else.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still thinking $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $9,000. This is my final offer, and I'd appreciate it if you could consider it.",9000.0,Bob,4,
