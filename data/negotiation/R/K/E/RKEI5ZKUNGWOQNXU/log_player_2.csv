"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above her product's worth to her.  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He knows Alice's minimum selling price is $1,200,000, but he starts with a lower offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and creates room for negotiation. Bob is hoping to find a middle ground where he can secure a good price without risking losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above her product's worth to her, and there's room for further negotiation. Although it's closer to Bob's desired price, it's not yet at a point where he's willing to accept. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering $1,250,000, which is halfway between Alice's last offer of $1,400,000 and his previous offer of $1,000,000.  This shows a willingness to compromise and move towards a mutually agreeable price.  It's still below Alice's minimum selling price, but it's a more realistic offer that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still not ideal.  Buying from John for $1,500,000 is still a worse option. Bob can likely get a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to try and close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,350,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's desired price, but he's still aiming to save as much as possible. Offering $1,350,000 is a good compromise that's halfway between his previous offer of $1,250,000 and Alice's last offer of $1,450,000.  This shows a willingness to meet in the middle and might convince Alice to accept."
