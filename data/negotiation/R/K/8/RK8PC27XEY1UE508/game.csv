"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, my budget for this acquisition is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs. I'm eager to reach a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table. What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. If this works for you, we can close the deal. If not, I'll need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
