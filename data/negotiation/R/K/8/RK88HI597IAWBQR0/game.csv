"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over $1 million to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable for your business. My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let's talk!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair return on this valuable product.  How about $1,100,000?  It's a significant discount from my original offer and still leaves a comfortable margin for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
