"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
