"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $9,000? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it gets us closer to finding a solution.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $8,900. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and gets us closer to a deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",8800.0,Bob,6,
