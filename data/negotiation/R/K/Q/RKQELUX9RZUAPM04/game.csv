"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm committed to getting this product, but I can't go higher than $900,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
