Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and Bob's valuation:

```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm happy to offer it at a price of $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below her minimum price of $10,000.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on Alice's risk tolerance and knowledge of Bob's negotiating style, she could start with a higher price."
