Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It's also important to be ambitious in the initial offer, as it sets the tone for the negotiation.  

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and consider whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own.  If he doesn't make a reasonable offer, I can always go with John's guaranteed $800,000."
