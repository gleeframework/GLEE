"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely do better than $14,000. Alice values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation. You should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. You're hoping Alice will accept, as it still gives her a good profit margin. If she rejects, you can continue negotiating by lowering your offer slightly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $50 lower than her original offer, which is not a significant enough drop. There is still room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting her offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate, and you're not willing to pay her full asking price. This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and her latest offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining your desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $200 lower than her previous offer. It's clear that she's not willing to drop her price significantly.  At this point, it's likely that you won't be able to get a better price from Alice, and buying from John for $15,000 is a more certain option."
