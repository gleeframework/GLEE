Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit lower than Bob's maximum might make him feel like he's getting a slight deal.
* **Time Value & Alternative:**  Mentioning listing it publicly implies other buyers might be interested, creating a sense of urgency. You also subtly signal you have a backup option with John."
