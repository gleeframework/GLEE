"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $12,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
