You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to Bob, so Alice's offer is too high. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. It's important to start with a lower price to give room for negotiation and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a lower price can be reached."

This offer is at Bob's maximum price point. It's a final offer that shows a willingness to buy but not exceed his budget. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will move on to John."
