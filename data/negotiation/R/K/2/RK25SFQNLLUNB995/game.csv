"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a great deal and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I understand you value it at $1,500,000, but my maximum is $1,000,000.  If you're willing to come down closer to that, I'm interested.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm really only able to go as high as $1,050,000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, as it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
