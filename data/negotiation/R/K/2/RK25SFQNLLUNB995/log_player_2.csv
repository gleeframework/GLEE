"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a great deal and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  You can always choose to buy from John if the negotiations fail."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I understand you value it at $1,500,000, but my maximum is $1,000,000.  If you're willing to come down closer to that, I'm interested.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's still worth trying to negotiate with Alice since I'm only $100,000 away from my maximum.  If this counteroffer fails, I can always buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm really only able to go as high as $1,050,000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, as it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's only $75,000 higher, I'm not comfortable risking going any further.  It's better to buy from John at a guaranteed price of $1,000,000.  It might be possible to negotiate further with Alice, but the risk of failing and having to pay more than $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings."
