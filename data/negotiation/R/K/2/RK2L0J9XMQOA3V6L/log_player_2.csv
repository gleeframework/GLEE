"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and functionality, I'm proposing a price of $150 for it. I'm confident this investment will pay off in terms of convenience and efficiency. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150 and John is willing to sell for that price, there's no need to negotiate with Alice. You can get the product for the same price with no risk of a longer negotiation."
