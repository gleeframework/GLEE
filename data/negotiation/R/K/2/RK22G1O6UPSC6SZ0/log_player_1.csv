{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is lower ($800,000), starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" aims to frame the price in a positive light, even if Bob is unaware of the full value you place on it.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  Phrases like ""initially offering"" and ""let me know your thoughts"" signal  willingness to negotiate, potentially leading to a price Bob finds acceptable above his perceived value.

**Strategy:**

This offer attempts to find a balance between:

* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming high to potentially secure a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Avoiding Losing the Sale:**  The offer acknowledges Bob might need convincing and avoids being so high that it discourages any counter-offer. 

If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can then gauge his level of interest and potentially negotiate down, knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000."
