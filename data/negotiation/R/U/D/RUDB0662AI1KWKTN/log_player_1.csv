Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm framing the offer as fair, highlighting the product's value to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, setting the stage for a back-and-forth.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worthwhile or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer or at least closer to my minimum. I will need to gauge how far I can push Bob, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $500,000 is unfortunately too low. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's low offer but not shutting the door entirely.  
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing $800,000, which is the midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and shows willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify the price.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using language that emphasizes a mutually beneficial outcome, encouraging a constructive negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to consider:
    *  How low I'm willing to go (keeping in mind my minimum and John's offer).
    *  Whether Bob's counteroffer is reasonable or if I should move on to John."
