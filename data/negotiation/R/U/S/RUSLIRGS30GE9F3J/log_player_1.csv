Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $950,000 offer. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll bridge the gap to a price that satisfies me while also keeping Bob interested. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a sure thing and meets my minimum acceptable price."
