"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer,  how about $10,500?  This would be a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
