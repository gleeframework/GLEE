"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $900,000."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand you're looking for a more competitive price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is too low, I could be persuaded to let it go for $1,350,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to move on the price. I appreciate that. To be frank, $1,350,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to meeting closer to the middle at $1,125,000?"",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're definitely a tough negotiator! I respect that.  While $1,125,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a touch lower than I can comfortably go.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,237,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,237,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,237,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

We're getting very close to John's price, but there's still a chance to squeeze a bit more value out of negotiating with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle this right now at $1,180,000?  That's a strong offer and would allow us to wrap things up today."",
