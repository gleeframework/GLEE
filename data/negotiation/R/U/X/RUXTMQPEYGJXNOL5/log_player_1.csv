Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,190,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer as I have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price just below John's offer ($1,190,000) leaves little room for negotiation but maximizes potential profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to accept.
* **Clean Break:**  ""Take-it-or-leave-it"" minimizes back-and-forth and allows you to quickly move to John if Bob declines. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you are confident in John's guaranteed purchase at $1,200,000."
