Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Leaving Room for Agreement:** $1,400,000 is still below my minimum of $1,500,000, but it's within the range of a potential win-win scenario.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the deal's value to Bob and expressing confidence in a successful negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of getting a good price while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,200,000 is still a decent sum, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  Bob's initial rejection and counteroffer indicate he is interested in the product. By rejecting his offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially push him to offer a higher price.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. However, I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price. 

This strategy keeps the negotiation open while maintaining the possibility of securing a better deal with Bob or falling back on John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the product's value to you and provides us both with a reasonable outcome. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  Instead of rejecting outright, I'm offering a counteroffer that shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob again, subtly reminding him of its worth.
* **Finding a middle ground:**  I'm framing my offer as a compromise and an opportunity to reach a mutually agreeable solution. 

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while pushing Bob towards a price closer to my desired target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is low for you, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,225,000 for the product. This is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $1,225,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited room for further negotiation:**  Bob has already moved from his initial $1,200,000 to $1,225,000.  There's limited room for him to increase his offer further, and I risk losing time and potentially making a concession that's not worth it.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price.  There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price.

This decision prioritizes securing my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of a protracted negotiation that might not lead to a more favorable outcome."
