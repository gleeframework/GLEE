"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has great potential to benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  Considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product, I'd be willing to pay $850000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. I think this is a fair compromise considering its worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $850000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal considering the value of the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1050000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1050000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm confident that $950000 is a fair price that benefits both of us.  It's a significant step closer to my budget and still reflects the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1025000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1025000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my last offer of $950000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,8,
