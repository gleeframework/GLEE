"I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to my target price of $8,000 as possible.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This price reflects the value of the product while still giving you a great deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price of $8,000.",11500.0,Bob,4,
