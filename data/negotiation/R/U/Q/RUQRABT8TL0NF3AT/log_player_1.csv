Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will be telling. If he outright rejects the offer, it suggests he may not be willing to go much higher than your minimum. If he counters, you know he's seriously interested and negotiations can continue.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John. This safety net allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually decrease your asking price, but always aim to stay above your $12,000 minimum."
