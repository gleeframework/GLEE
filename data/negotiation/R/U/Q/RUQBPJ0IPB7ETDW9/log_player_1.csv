Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A $1,000 gap between my asking price and Bob's value allows for a reasonable back-and-forth. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum, I can confidently negotiate with Bob without feeling pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  It's a great price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's willing to negotiate. This gives me a chance to counter with a higher price that is still within a reasonable range. 
* **John's Offer:**  Knowing John is waiting in the wings with a $12,000 offer provides me with leverage during the counter-offer phase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $10,500 is halfway between my initial offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Benefits:** I emphasize that this price is ""fair"" and allows for a ""mutually beneficial agreement.""  This helps build rapport and suggests that I'm not just focused on maximizing my own profit. 
* **Leveraging John's Offer:**  By mentioning the need to stay ""closer to my asking price,"" I subtly imply that I have other options, reminding Bob of the potential deal with John."
