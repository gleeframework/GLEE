"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1300000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm willing to meet you at $1500000, which is the price I was initially willing to sell it to John for. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I've already been willing to meet you halfway and even offered you a price that's closer to what I was initially willing to sell it to John for. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1400000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your frustration, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to walk away, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on this deal just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1350000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1350000.0,Alice,9,
