"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking to pay closer to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer is better than her first one, it's still not ideal. Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I'm still a bit above your offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $11,150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,150 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $11,000.  At this point, it's worth it for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product for a price that is significantly lower than buying from John.  Continued negotiation might save a few more dollars, but it's likely not worth the time and effort."
