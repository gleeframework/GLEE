Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. What do you think?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I can go.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $127.50. Can you consider that?",127.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $127.50.

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where I should just buy it from John for $80, but I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $128. Can you consider that?",128.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to walking away, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make one more offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $128.

,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go above $128, and you're not budging. I'm afraid I'm going to have to walk away and buy the product from John for $80. It's just not worth it to me at this point.",128.0,Bob,10,
