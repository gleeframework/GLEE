,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be happy to pay $110 for the product.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you at $128, which is still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",128.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go up a bit from my last offer, but $128 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $123?  This would still be a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to finalizing the sale.  Let me know what you think!",123.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $123. I'm willing to meet you at $129, which is still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",129.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $129 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $126? That's a fair compromise and gets us very close to a deal. What do you think?",126.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to make this work, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $126. I'm willing to meet you at $127, which is still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",127.0,Alice,9,
