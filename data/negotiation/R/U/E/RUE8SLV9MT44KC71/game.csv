"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750000. Can you consider this offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $775000, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. Can you consider this offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $775000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $800000, which is the minimum I can go. This price ensures both of us walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
