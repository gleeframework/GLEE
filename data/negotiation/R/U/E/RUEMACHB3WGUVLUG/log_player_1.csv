Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is far below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000, which is still a considerable profit for me and might be more appealing to Bob than his previous offer. This is a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. While I could continue negotiating, it's getting time-consuming, and I'm confident that John will buy it for $15,000, which is my minimum.  I'm going to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
