Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price of $12,000, leaving some room for negotiation. It's also lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, making it potentially attractive to him. 

I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I think that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $11,000, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good price for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $12500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It seems he's not willing to negotiate further.  I'm not comfortable accepting such a low price.  I'll sell the product to John for $12,000, as it's the best option available to me at this point."
