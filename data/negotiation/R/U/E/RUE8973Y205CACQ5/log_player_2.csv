"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes sense to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford $100 right now.  Would you be willing to negotiate?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for 100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for 130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $130 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still too high for me. How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than 125. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really benefit from it. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at 125. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $125 is still above your maximum budget of $100.  You have a guaranteed way to get the product from John for $100, so it's better to take that option rather than risk continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially ending up with a worse deal or running out of time."
