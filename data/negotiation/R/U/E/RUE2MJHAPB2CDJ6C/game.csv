"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $1,250,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider it?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
