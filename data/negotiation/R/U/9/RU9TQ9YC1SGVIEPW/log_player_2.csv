Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.

It seems Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,500.  At this point, it's more strategic to buy from John for $15,000.  While it's not ideal, it's better than potentially getting stuck in a protracted negotiation and ending up paying close to that anyway."
