"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer. You have a decent chance of getting the product for less than $1,350,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is still a good price for me, as it's lower than Alice's offer but higher than her minimum acceptable price.  This gives her some room to negotiate while still potentially saving me money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. Although it's closer to my initial goal, there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to take another round of counteroffers to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, but I'm willing to increase my offer a little to $1,300,000. This is a compromise, and it signals my willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget. This hopefully encourages Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is too close to John's price of $1,500,000.  While it's possible to continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice, as she's clearly not willing to drop her price significantly. Buying from John guarantees me the product at a slightly higher price, but with the assurance of a successful transaction."
