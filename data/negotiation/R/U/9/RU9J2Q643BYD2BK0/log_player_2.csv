"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000 for this product.  I know it's worth more to you, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,320,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is still a good deal. It's closer to his ideal price and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a higher price or a breakdown in the negotiation."
