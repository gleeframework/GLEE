"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000 for this product.  I know it's worth more to you, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,320,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further negotiation.",1320000.0,Alice,3,
