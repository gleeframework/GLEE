,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is lower than I'd like. How about we meet at $10,500? I believe that's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
