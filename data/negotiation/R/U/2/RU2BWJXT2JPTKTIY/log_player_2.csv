"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. While I can't disclose specifics right now, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly special. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While she claims it's worth at least that amount to her, there's no guarantee it's actually worth more to you. You have a guaranteed alternative with John at a price within your budget."
