"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a strong opening offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is significantly higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $975,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut bait. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,025,000. Buying from John at $1,000,000 saves us more and avoids potentially lengthy further negotiations."
