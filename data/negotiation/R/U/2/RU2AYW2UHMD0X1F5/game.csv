"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a strong opening offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is significantly higher. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $975,000? That would be a great price for me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $975,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
