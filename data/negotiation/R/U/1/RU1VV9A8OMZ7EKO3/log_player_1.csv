Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is slightly above the product's worth to Bob. It gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer,  and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,800 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
