"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $500,000 is a significant amount, and there's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes my intention to negotiate aggressively and potentially get a much better deal.  It's important to remember that Alice's true value for the product is unknown, and this counteroffer will give me a better sense of her willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is a considerable improvement from Alice's initial offer, I'm still hoping to negotiate a lower price.  It's early in the negotiation, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower.  I'll continue to play it safe and reject the offer, aiming to find a price closer to my target of $300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $350,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm still aiming for a price lower than her current offer. This gradual increase in my counteroffer creates a sense of progress and could encourage Alice to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $450,000 is still too high for me at this stage. I am confident I can negotiate a lower price. It's still early in the negotiation, and I haven't reached my limit.  By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling to Alice that I'm determined to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $400,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise and move closer to her price.  It's a strategic move to potentially get a deal done before reaching the middle ground of $450,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is back to her initial price, and I'm not ready to accept it yet.  While the risk of running out of rounds is growing, I'm confident that I can still negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer gives me another opportunity to try and bridge the gap.  If the next offer is still not acceptable, I might consider making a counteroffer closer to Alice's price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $425,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's current price.  It demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but also sends a signal that I'm not willing to go much higher.  With only a few rounds left, it's a calculated risk to see if I can get Alice to accept this offer or if I need to start considering buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut my losses.  Alice's offer has gone up, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of not reaching a deal and being forced to pay $1,000,000 from John is too high.  Buying from John ensures I get the product, even if it means paying a higher price.  I've learned that Alice is a tough negotiator, and in this situation, it's better to secure the product than to risk losing it altogether."
