{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts at a price above what Bob values the product at, but it's still below your minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring you still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $90 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, but $95 is the absolute most I can do.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $95 is close to my minimum price, I'm feeling confident that I can get a better deal with John. The potential gain from selling to John is higher than the potential loss from negotiating with Bob, who's already shown he's unwilling to budge much further."
