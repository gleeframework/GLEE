"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further to find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. This product is interesting to me, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, I'm still finding it a bit high.  Could you do $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you $825,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would be my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
