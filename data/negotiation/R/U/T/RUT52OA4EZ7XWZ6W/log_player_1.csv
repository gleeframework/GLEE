Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below our minimum ($120).
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited time"" offer, we might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this specific scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a slightly higher sale than $120.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, we know we have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John, so there's no need to counter Bob's rejection."
