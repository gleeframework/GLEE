"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to accept $650,000. It falls considerably below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product holds significant value, and I am committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the value of your product.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution.  While $725,000 is closer, it's still below the value I need to realize.  Let's try $850,000.  This is a significant step towards your position, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $760,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while recognizing my financial limits.  Let's close this deal, what do you say?",760000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your persistence.  However, $760,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $805,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our previous offers.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",805000.0,Alice,7,
