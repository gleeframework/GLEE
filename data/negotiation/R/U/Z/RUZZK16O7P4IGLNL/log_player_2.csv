# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($1,200,000).  This means there's potential to negotiate further with Alice. Rejecting the offer leaves the door open for further negotiation."
