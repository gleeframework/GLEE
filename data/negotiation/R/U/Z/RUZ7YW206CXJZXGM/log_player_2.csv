"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $900,000 is a significant amount of money. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower, especially since she's eager to sell.  Rejecting the offer allows me to gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. It signals that I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price.  $700,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for potential compromise.  It's important to be bold and assertive in the initial counteroffer, especially since we have multiple rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $825000, which is a significant discount from my original price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $825,000 is still too high.  I want to see if she's truly willing to negotiate and come down further.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a fair price considering the potential value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a small increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. It's a mid-point between my previous offer and Alice's latest proposal. This strategy should encourage Alice to move closer to my desired price without risking a complete breakdown in negotiations. I'm still confident I can secure a better deal than John's offer, so it's important to keep pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I can meet you halfway between $825000 and $750000, which would be $787500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably from her initial offer.  While $787,500 is still above my ideal price, it's getting close.  At this point, it's a gamble.  If I reject the offer, I risk Alice walking away, or she may not come down further.  Since John's offer is $1,000,000, accepting Alice's offer saves me $212,500. It's a good deal, and it's better than the alternative."
