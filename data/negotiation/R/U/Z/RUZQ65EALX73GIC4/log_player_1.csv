Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a competitive price, and I get a quick sale.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm not desperate for a sale, and I have a guaranteed offer from John.  I'll see if I can get closer to my asking price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I am not feeling pressured to sell. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I have only 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk ending up with a deal that doesn't meet my minimum value.  Selling to John guarantees me my target price, so that's the best option for me."
