Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. It's better to try and negotiate a higher price or sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $8,500 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to do $7,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $7,200 is closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,200 simply isn't enough for me.  Let's split the difference - $7,800.  This is a fair price that considers both our perspectives."", ""product_price"": 7800}
