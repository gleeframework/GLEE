Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** While I haven't explicitly stated why the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, the tone implies there's value beyond the $10,000 he might be aware of.  This encourages him to consider potential benefits he might not have factored in.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the lines of communication open.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer. If Bob knew you had a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, your negotiating position weakens. 
* There's a risk Bob might be put off by the initial high price. It's crucial to gauge his reaction and be prepared to adjust your approach if necessary."
