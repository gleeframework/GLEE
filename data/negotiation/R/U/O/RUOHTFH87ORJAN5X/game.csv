"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to come down a bit, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow me to continue negotiating.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $10,625.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to move forward. What do you think?",10625.0,Alice,5,
