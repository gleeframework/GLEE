Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiating. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  While I'm aiming for a good price, I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my minimum requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is better than his initial rejection, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's room for further negotiation, as Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm not desperate for a sale. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to come down a bit, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow me to continue negotiating."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price above Bob's initial offer.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message highlights that this price would be ""fair"" for both of us, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still not willing to sell at Bob's price, but I'm showing flexibility to reach an agreement. 

This counteroffer maintains my leverage while signaling my willingness to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit below my budget. How about we meet at $9,500 was too high, but $10,000 is more reasonable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Although there's a difference of only $5,000 between my minimum and Bob's offer, I'm not desperate to sell at this price.  I believe there's a chance for further negotiation.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, but I'm willing to take a small risk to potentially get a slightly higher price from Bob.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $10,625.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to move forward. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10625}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($11,250) and Bob's latest offer ($10,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Fair Deal:**  The message reiterates that this price would be ""fair"" for both of us, emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit below my budget. How about we meet at $9,312.50, which is the average of $8,000 and $10,625?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,312.5

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Unacceptable:**  Despite Bob's attempts to find a compromise, his offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  It's possible that we could continue negotiating for a while longer, but there's no guarantee that Bob will ever meet my price.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable value. 

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price than I'm comfortable with.  Selling to John guarantees a safe and profitable outcome."
