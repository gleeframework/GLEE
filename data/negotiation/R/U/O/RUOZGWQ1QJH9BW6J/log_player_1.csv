"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $140.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within a reasonable range. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, and hopefully encourages Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $110. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is tempting, I won't settle for less than my minimum value of $120.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  This shows flexibility and signals a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $115?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  While Bob is getting closer, I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $115 is still a bit below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $120.  That's a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm offering my minimum price, which is still a decent profit for me, and hoping Bob will finally accept. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise to end the negotiation."
