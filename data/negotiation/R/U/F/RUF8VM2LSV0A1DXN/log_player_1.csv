Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and the product's specifications, I would like to propose $135 as my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more,  $135 is still above my minimum and it's getting late in the negotiation.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
