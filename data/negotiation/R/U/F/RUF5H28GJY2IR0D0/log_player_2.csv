{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

There's no incentive to accept Alice's offer at this point. It's the full price, and we have 10 rounds to potentially negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows us to start the counter-offer process."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This establishes a strong negotiating position and signals our intent to get a substantial discount. While it's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, it sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is a significant discount from her initial price. We have only a few rounds left, and further negotiation may not yield a better price. It's becoming more likely that we'll end up paying the full price to John, so accepting this offer guarantees a lower price and secures the product."
