Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to accept $910,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to make one last concession, so I'm counteroffering at $915,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's getting too risky to continue. Accepting $915,000 is a good deal and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at $1,000,000 if Alice's next offer is unacceptable."
