"Thank you for the offer, Alice. $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the fact that I'm a serious buyer.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $750,000. Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the original price I had in mind.",850000.0,Alice,3,
