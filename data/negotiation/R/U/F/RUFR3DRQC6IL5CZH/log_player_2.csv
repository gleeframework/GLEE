"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

$900,000 is a good deal, but Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the fact that I'm a serious buyer.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $750,000. Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the original price I had in mind.

$850,000 is a good price for Bob, considering he values the product at $1,200,000.  Accepting Alice's offer saves him $350,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation could potentially save him more, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ending up paying John's price isn't worth it."
