Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the fact that I'm a serious buyer.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
