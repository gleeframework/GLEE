"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I come down to $95? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $92.50? That's the most I can stretch my budget to.",92.5,Bob,4,
