"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $8,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
