"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $850,000 is a step closer, I'm still a bit away from my desired price point.  Let's find a mutually agreeable middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 for this product.  This allows for a significant profit for you and ensures a fair deal for me.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $950,000 is still above my target price, but I'm willing to come up to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
