"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  While $140 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $140 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $135. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning: Alice's offer of $135 is closer to my target price, and it's still within my budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject my counteroffer and we might end up stuck with John's price. Accepting this offer secures the product for a reasonable price."
