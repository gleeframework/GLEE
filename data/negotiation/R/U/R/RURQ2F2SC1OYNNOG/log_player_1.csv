Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant amount, but it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob, and I want to maximize my profits. If he rejects, I can always lower the price or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get more. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price.  I'll see if he's willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $850,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer. I'm going to accept his offer."
