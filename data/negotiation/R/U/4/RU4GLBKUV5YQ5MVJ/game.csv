,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you consider that price?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $78 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $81. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to make this one last compromise. What do you think?",81.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your last offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $79 for the product. Can you consider that price?",79.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $79. I can offer it to you for $80.50. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",80.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $80. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't agree on a price. I'd be happy to buy the product from John for $80, so I'm making a final offer of $80 to you.",80.0,Bob,8,
