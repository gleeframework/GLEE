"Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $120. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $120. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a little too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about we settle on $135? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you'll still get a good deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $135 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $142.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",142.5,Alice,5,
