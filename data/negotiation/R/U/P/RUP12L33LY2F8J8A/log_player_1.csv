Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. It's clear this product holds significant value for both of us.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,250,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards his target price, but we're still significantly above our minimum. We have room to negotiate and should try to push him closer to at least $1.3 million."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have budget considerations, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's settle this right now.  How about $1,310,000?  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1310000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Firmness:** By presenting this as my ""final offer"", I introduce a sense of urgency and signal that I'm unwilling to go much lower. 
* **Compromise:** I am moving closer to Bob's price range, but still aiming for a significantly higher number than his last offer. 
* **Strategic Timing:**  We are past the halfway point in the negotiations, so adding a touch of pressure is warranted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit below your last offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not there yet. I'll hold firm for now, as I still have a few rounds to negotiate and John's offer provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000, but that's as low as I can go.  This is a fantastic deal for a product you won't find anywhere else."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Urgency:**  I'm signaling that the negotiation is reaching its final stages by emphasizing how close we are to a deal.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm offering another concession to show flexibility and encourage Bob to meet me closer to my price.
* **Holding Strong:**  I'm holding firm above the $1.25 million mark, as dropping below that sends the signal that I'm willing to go even lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer has dropped significantly, and he's now below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It seems unlikely he'll bridge that gap in the remaining two rounds. Selling to John guarantees my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
