"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're committed to $850,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $900,000. This is my final offer on this price, so I hope you can meet me here.",900000.0,Alice,5,
