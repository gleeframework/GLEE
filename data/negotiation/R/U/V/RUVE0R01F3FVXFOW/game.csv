"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the market price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,
