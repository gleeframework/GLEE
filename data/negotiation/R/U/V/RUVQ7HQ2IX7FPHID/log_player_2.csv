"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $90. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"", ""product_price"": 70}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's offer, we aim to gauge her flexibility and leave room for negotiation.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone encourages continued negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is closer to Alice's value ($80) than our maximum ($100), giving us bargaining power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I think $70 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $85. Would you be interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved towards our price, there's still room for negotiation. We're closer to her value ($80) and should try to push a bit further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving closer to Alice's price in smaller increments, showing willingness to compromise but not capitulating entirely.
* **Framing as Win-Win:**  Presenting $75 as a ""fair price for both of us"" encourages Alice to see it as a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Nearing the Endgame:** We're getting close to our limit, but there's still a chance Alice might accept to avoid losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I can do $82.50. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  While we could try to negotiate further, Alice's offer is now only $2.50 above her value and $17.50 below John's price. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The potential savings from further negotiation are minimal compared to the risk of Alice walking away.
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting at $82.50 guarantees we get the product at a reasonable price."
