"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. It's still a significant investment, but I think that's a more reasonable price.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget.  However, $600000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $850000, which still allows for a good profit for both of us. Let's find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $725000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I can't go that low.  $725000 is still too far below my minimum.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $800000, but I'm still not sure if that's the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $775000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to move forward.",775000.0,Bob,6,
