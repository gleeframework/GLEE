"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. It's still a significant investment, but I think that's a more reasonable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While I'm eager to sell,  $600,000 is too far below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget.  However, $600,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still allows for a good profit for both of us. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $725000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $725,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I can't go that low.  $725,000 is still too far below my minimum.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $800000, but I'm still not sure if that's the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $775000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident Bob will budge much further.  He's only willing to pay $775,000, which is still below my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,200,000."
