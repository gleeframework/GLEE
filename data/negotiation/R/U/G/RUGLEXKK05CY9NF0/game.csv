,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our needs.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
