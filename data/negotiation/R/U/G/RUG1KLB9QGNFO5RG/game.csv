"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $14,000. It's a good middle ground that still reflects the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $11,000?  That's a fair offer, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $11,000. I can offer it to you for $12,500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
