"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're getting close to your target price, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to give up on the extra $2.50. How about we meet you halfway between $135 and $127.50 at $131.25? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that.",131.25,Alice,5,
