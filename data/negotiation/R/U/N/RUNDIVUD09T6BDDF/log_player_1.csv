Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000 and we have a guaranteed offer for $15,000, starting high gives us room to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" we provide a reason for the high price without explicitly revealing our minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:**  This offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, we know he's likely not willing to pay much more than his perceived value. We can then decide whether to counter-offer or move on to John. 
* **Backup Plan:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer provides leverage. We're not desperate to sell below our minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. The goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both parties, but ultimately maximizes your profit."
