"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's meet in the middle!",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you finding some middle ground.  I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with. Would you be open to $1,150,000?  I believe that's a fair offer considering its value.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,200,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, as it's a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
