"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, I want to start with a significantly lower offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone is crucial in negotiations.  I acknowledge Alice's offer and express continued interest in the product.
* **Strategic Aim:**  My counteroffer is a bit more than 25% below Alice's asking price. This provides a starting point that, while ambitious, leaves room for us to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my limit, but it's still above what John is offering. 
* **Negotiating Power:** I'm willing to push a bit further since I have John's offer as a backup. A slight rejection might encourage Alice to come down a little more. 
* **Aiming for a Win-Win:**  My goal is to find a price that works for both of us, but I need to prioritize my own budget."

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you finding some middle ground.  I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with. Would you be open to $1,150,000?  I believe that's a fair offer considering its value."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** My counteroffer splits the difference between her offer ($1,250,000) and my last one ($1,050,000).  
* **Justification:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value while subtly reminding her that it needs to align with my budget.
* **Pressure Point:**  This offer puts a bit more pressure on Alice. It's a significant jump from my last offer, signaling serious interest, but still keeps me below my maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,200,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, as it's a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Offers:** Alice's offer now matches John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **No Further Advantage:**  At this point, I've reached my maximum budget. Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a lower price from Alice.
* **Secure the Deal:** Accepting now ensures I get the product and avoids the risk of Alice increasing her price again."
