"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for a lower price than $1,100,000 by negotiating with Alice.  While there's a risk she might reject your counteroffer, it's worth trying to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice values the product at $1,000,000, offering $950,000 is a reasonable starting point. This leaves room for negotiation and still offers Alice a profit. It's also significantly lower than her initial offer, increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,050,000, which is within your budget and closer to your desired price. It's still a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,200,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer, and you'd be left with the less favorable option of buying from John. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
