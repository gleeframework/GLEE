"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too low for me. This product is truly unique and I know it will bring you a lot of value. How about we settle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is unique, but I still think $15,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle at $13,750?",13750.0,Bob,4,
