Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can always come down a bit, or sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  If he rejects again, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I could continue negotiating,  I don't want to risk going back and forth for too long.  I'll sell to John for $80 to guarantee a sale at my minimum."
