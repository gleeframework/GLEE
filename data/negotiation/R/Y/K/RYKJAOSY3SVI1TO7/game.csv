"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product at $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I'm willing to take another step towards meeting you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $10000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
