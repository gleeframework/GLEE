Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, at least $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above your minimum:**  You're getting more than your minimum value of $10,000.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's value of $15,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **Is a reasonable first offer:**  It's not too aggressive, allowing for a more collaborative negotiation. 

We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is below my minimum price of $10,000.  While I could sell to John for $10,000 right now, it's worth trying to get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my original offer of $12,500.  This will keep the negotiation moving and hopefully lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $11,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair price:**  $11,000 is still above my minimum and provides a good profit.
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and emphasizing the value Bob would get. 

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to reach a deal while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk is that I'll end up losing more time and still not get a price I'm comfortable with.  John is offering a guaranteed $10,000, which is a better outcome for me at this point."
