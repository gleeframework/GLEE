"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go for $10,750?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices again, so how about we go for $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
