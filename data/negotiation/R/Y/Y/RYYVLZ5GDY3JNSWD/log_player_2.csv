# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers.  It makes the most sense to go with John's deal."
