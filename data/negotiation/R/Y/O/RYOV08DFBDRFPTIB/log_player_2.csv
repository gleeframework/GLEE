Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product could be beneficial, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. $1,150,000 is close, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 for this deal to make sense for me. How about $1,275,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

Alice is coming down, but very slowly. At this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation.  John's offer of $1,200,000 is better than Alice's current price and ensures you stay within your budget."
