"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product could be beneficial, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,500,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? ",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. $1,150,000 is close, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 for this deal to make sense for me. How about $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
