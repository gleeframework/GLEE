"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, my costs and value for this product are higher than $100. I can do $135, which is the lowest I can go. Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's find a middle ground.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out. I can do $125, which is the best I can do at this point. Let's see if we can make a deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
