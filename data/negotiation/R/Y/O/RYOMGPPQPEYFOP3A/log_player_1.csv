Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150 but leaves room for negotiation. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm aiming for a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price that's closer to my perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer to sell it for more, $160 is a reasonable compromise.  This is a good profit for me, considering my minimum price, and it avoids further negotiation and the risk of ending up with John's lower offer."
