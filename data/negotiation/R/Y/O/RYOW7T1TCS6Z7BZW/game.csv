"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love.  I'm asking for $170 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested but $170 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $120 to make this worthwhile. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $120 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price. However, $95 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. This would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to hear you're willing to compromise.  I'm still not able to go higher than $100.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase the product from you.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $100 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $105? It's a good compromise and I think it's a fair price for the product.",105.0,Alice,7,
