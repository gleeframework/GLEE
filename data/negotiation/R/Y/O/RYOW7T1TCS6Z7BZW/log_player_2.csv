Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested but $170 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $120 to make this worthwhile. What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Alice's offer is still too high. You can try a counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $120 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price. However, $95 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. This would be a fair deal for both of us, I think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're getting closer to your target price, but $110 is still a bit too high. You can try another counteroffer to see if you can get Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to hear you're willing to compromise.  I'm still not able to go higher than $100.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase the product from you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $100 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $105? It's a good compromise and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $105 is close to your target, you only have 3 rounds left.  It's likely Alice won't budge much further, and you could end up paying more than you're comfortable with.  It's better to take the sure thing with John and get the product for your maximum price."
