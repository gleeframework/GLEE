"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110?  This would still give you a good price, and it's closer to what I need.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $100 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? This would be a fair compromise, and it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",102.5,Alice,7,
