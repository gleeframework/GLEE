"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll love it!  I'm asking $150 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110?  This would still give you a good price, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Reason:** I'm not just rejecting his offer outright, but offering a counter with a justification.
* **Compromise, but Not Too Much:** I'm dropping the price to $110, which is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I'm trying to reframe the price by mentioning that it's a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target. I believe I can get a better deal with more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $105.  This is a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continuing to Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down to $105, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:**  I'm framing the price as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. Considering my budget constraints, could we settle for $100? I believe this would be a reasonable compromise for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $100 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. With only four rounds remaining, I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target. Selling to John for $120 is always an option, but I believe I can get a better deal with more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $100 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? This would be a fair compromise, and it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I'm acknowledging Bob's willingness to compromise by mentioning that his offer is getting closer.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly in the middle of his last offer and my previous one. This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.

* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. Considering my budget, could we agree on $100? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to get a price closer to my target.  Bob has been persistent with his offer of $100, and while it's not ideal, it's significantly higher than my minimum.  However, the risk of not reaching an agreement and being forced to sell to John for $120 is too great.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $120."
