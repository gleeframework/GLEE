I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but still leaves me with a profit. I believe this price is attractive enough to Bob while also leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I believe I can get a better price from Bob by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,500.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I hope it will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000. While I was hoping to get a better price from Bob, his counteroffer hasn't changed, and I'm now faced with the risk of continuing a protracted negotiation that might not lead to a successful outcome.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
