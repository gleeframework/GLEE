You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is only worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate further.  It's possible Alice might come down a bit more, or Bob could buy from John for a guaranteed $12,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $13750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is consistently offering a price above Bob's maximum value, and it's likely the negotiation will continue in this pattern.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the guaranteed $12,000 price from John rather than risk getting stuck with a higher price after more rounds of negotiation."
