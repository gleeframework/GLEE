"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my budget of $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. Can we discuss some other options that could work for both of us?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $14,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my budget of $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we keep working together.",8500.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one final offer. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,9,
