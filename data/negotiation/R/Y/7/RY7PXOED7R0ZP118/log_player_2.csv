# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. Can we discuss some other options that could work for both of us?

# Alice's message: I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one final offer. I can offer you the product for $11,000.
