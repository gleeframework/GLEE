"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,400,000. It's a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.  Let's try to find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is a very fair price, and it allows us to both walk away with a good deal. Let's close this deal now.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I need to be honest, I'm getting close to considering John's offer. Can you reconsider and meet me at $1,240,000?",1240000.0,Bob,6,
