"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** It's above your maximum budget of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $100. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback:**  It's always an option if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. How about we split the difference? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:**  While it's closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price.
* **More negotiation is possible:**  Alice is willing to negotiate further.
* **Buying from John is a backup:** It's good to have this option in case the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. Let's meet in the middle at $107.50. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to go down to $109. It's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within budget:**  $109 is within your maximum budget of $120.
* **No further significant gains:**  There's not much room for further negotiation, and you're already close to your ideal price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject this offer, there's a chance Alice will either refuse to negotiate further or you might run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
