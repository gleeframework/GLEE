"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, it's still a significant amount of money. There's potential to save more by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given its unique qualities, I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $850,000 is a substantial saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  While there's always a chance of getting a lower price, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for a few more thousand dollars in savings. It's time to secure the product at a good price."
