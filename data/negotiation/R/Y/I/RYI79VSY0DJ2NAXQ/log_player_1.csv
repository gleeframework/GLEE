Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
