"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial asking price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  I feel this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while still offering you a great deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,500,000 is still a little too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This would be a fair price that respects the value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
