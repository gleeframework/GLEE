Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial asking price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  I feel this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while still offering you a great deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,500,000 is still a little too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This would be a fair price that respects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
