Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to secure a price significantly higher than your guaranteed $800,000 from John, while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
