Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counter-offers.  It's also a good starting point to gauge his interest and assess whether he sees significant value in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob, and I risk losing him as a buyer. Selling to John at the same price provides no additional benefit. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and certain sale at my minimum desired price."
