"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it has the potential to revolutionize the industry. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to start by seeing if you can get a better deal.  Alice's initial offer is your maximum price, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:** Starting with a significant discount (20%) shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and willing to walk away. 
* **Clear and concise:** The message is brief and focuses on the price while expressing interest in the product. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:** $1,000,000 is still a substantial offer, leaving space for a middle ground in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and my last offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Focus on fairness:** I frame the offer as a ""fair deal"" for both of us, appealing to her sense of reason.
* **Maintain leverage:**  This offer is still significantly less than her initial price, keeping pressure on her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1075000. I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this incredible product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not quite there. We're within a relatively small range now ($75,000 difference).  I believe I can still negotiate a lower price, so I'll reject her offer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,087,500. This would be a fair compromise, considering your initial offer and my previous offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1087500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference again:** I'm offering to split the difference between her latest offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm committed to reaching a compromise.
