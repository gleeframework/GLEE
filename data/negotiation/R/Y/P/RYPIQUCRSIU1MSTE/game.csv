,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $980,000 still falls short of what I believe the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle at $1,015,000. It's a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What are your thoughts?",1015000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still think $1,015,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",990000.0,Bob,6,
