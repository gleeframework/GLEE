"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. Would you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  How about we try $11,500? I believe that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $11,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",13000.0,Alice,5,
