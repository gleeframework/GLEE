Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $17,000.  This is a little above Bob's perceived value, but it gives us room to negotiate. If he rejects, I can always lower the price or go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value of $15,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}

I'm going to counter with $16,000.  This is still a bit above Bob's offer, but closer to my desired price.  Hopefully, we can come to a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  While I'd prefer $15,000, I'm happy to take $14,000 to avoid further negotiation.  I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away completely, and I'd be stuck selling to John for $15,000."
