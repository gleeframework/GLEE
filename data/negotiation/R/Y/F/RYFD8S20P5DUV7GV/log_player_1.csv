"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $80, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a reasonable profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum of $120. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $80 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet at $85? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell below $120. I'll counter Bob's offer again, but I'm also getting closer to selling to John if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to go down to $95, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll be selling to someone else."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.50, that's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's not willing to meet my minimum price, and I've already made several concessions. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $120."
