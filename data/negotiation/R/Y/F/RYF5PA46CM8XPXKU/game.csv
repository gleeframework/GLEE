"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $10,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
