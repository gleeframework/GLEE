"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high. You're aiming to save as much as possible, and there's room for negotiation.
* You have 10 rounds, so rejecting this offer gives you more time to try and lower the price. 
* Buying from John immediately for $1,500,000 is a less attractive option than negotiating with Alice, even if it's a guaranteed deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above my target price. 
* I have 7 rounds remaining, and there's still room for further negotiation.
* Buying from John right now would cost significantly more than what I'm hoping to achieve with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1,100,000?  This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now willing to offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is getting close to my target price, and I've only got 5 rounds left.
* If I reject this offer, there's a chance Alice will either hold firm or make a counteroffer that's even higher than her previous offer. 
* Buying from John would be a significant loss, as $1,125,000 is still much less than his $1,500,000 price. 

While I'd ideally like to push for a lower price, accepting this offer seems like the best option to maximize my savings while still ensuring I get the product."
