Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
