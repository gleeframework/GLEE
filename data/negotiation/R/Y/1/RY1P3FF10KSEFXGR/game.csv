"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,000,000. This reflects the value I bring to the table and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $850,000. This allows for a good profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,
