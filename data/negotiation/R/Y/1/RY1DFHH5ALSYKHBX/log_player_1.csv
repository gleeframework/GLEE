Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your ideal outcome. This leaves room for negotiation while anchoring the price in Bob's mind at a higher point. 
* **Understanding Value:** We know the product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,500,000) than our minimum acceptable price ($800,000).  
* **Leaving John as Backup:** Having a guaranteed offer from John provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't go well, we can always accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate between Bob's offer and his perceived value of $1,500,000. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, we can gauge how eager Bob is to purchase and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While your offer is tempting, I believe the true value of this product is closer to $1,450,000.  It offers significant returns, and I'm confident you'll see that value realized."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer but holding firm above the $1,400,000 mark. This shows willingness to negotiate while reinforcing the product's high value.
* **Justifying the Price:** By highlighting the ""significant returns"" Bob will receive, we're emphasizing the value proposition and providing a reason to meet our price.
* **Maintaining Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in our price can influence Bob's perception of the deal's fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,400,000. Is there any flexibility on your end? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  Bob's offer of $1,400,000 provides a substantial profit margin over our minimum of $800,000 and John's offer.
* **Potential Stalemate:** Bob seems firm at $1,400,000. Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome and could risk losing the sale.
* **Bird in Hand:**  It's generally wise to accept a strong offer rather than risking the unknown in further negotiation rounds."
