"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great value, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
