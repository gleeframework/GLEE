"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's below Bob's perceived value of $15,000 but still above my minimum of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway, but still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $800 below my desired price, and I'm already four rounds in.  Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a sale to John at the minimum."
