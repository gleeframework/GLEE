"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and while my minimum price is steep, I'm open to finding a number that works for us both. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $2,200,000.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $600,000 range.  Would you be willing to come down significantly?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects the value this product brings. How about we meet halfway between our two previous offers at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value this product represents, but $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute best offer.  If we can't agree on a price in this range, I may have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,200,000 is closer, I need to stay closer to my budget.  Could you do $800,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering the market value.",800000.0,Bob,6,
