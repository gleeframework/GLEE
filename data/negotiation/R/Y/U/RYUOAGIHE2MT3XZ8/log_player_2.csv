"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $1,200,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for a lower price."
