"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $130.  I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can likely get a better price than $130, so it's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the offer, Bob, but I'm looking for something closer to $125.  It's a very desirable item and I'm confident in its value.

While $125 is better than $130, it's still within the range where further negotiation is likely possible.  I'll reject and see if we can get closer to my target of $110."
