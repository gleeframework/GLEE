"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $90. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm really only able to spend $100. If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm ready to buy. ",100.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $100, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $110?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit outside my budget. If you could come down to $105, I'd be happy to buy the product from you. ",105.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we meet at $115?",115.0,Alice,7,
