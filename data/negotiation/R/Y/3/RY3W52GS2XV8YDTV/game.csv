"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's find common ground, and hopefully, we can reach a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the market value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,225,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you'll receive from the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,225,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, and it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll offer you the product for $1,210,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
