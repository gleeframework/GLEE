"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  Bob can do better. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob is better off rejecting this offer and trying to negotiate further to get a price closer to his target.  If he can't reach a deal with Alice, he can always buy from John."
