"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

``` 

You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price.  $9,000 is more than your maximum budget, and you can always buy from John for $8,000."

I'm offering $7,500, which is still within my budget and a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still being a good deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,200 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to counteroffer again to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm going to offer $7,800. This is a small increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise, but still below Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $8,150 is still higher than my maximum budget, and I'm getting tired of negotiating. At this point, it's better to just buy from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
