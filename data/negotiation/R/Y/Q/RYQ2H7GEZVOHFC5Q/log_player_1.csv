{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to my bottom line, but I'm still willing to hold out for a slightly higher price. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, so I believe there's still room to maneuver."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still very interested in the product, and I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $850,000. I think this is a fair price, and I'd be happy to move forward at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is holding firm at $850,000 and we're past the halfway point in the negotiation. While I could push for a bit more, there's a risk he walks away. $850,000 is a significant profit, and it's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him and potentially getting only $800,000 from John."
