"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $7,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price, and I believe I can negotiate a better price.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $7,000 is too far below what I need to sell the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer.  How about $8,500? This would allow us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, $7,750 is still too low.  I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue working with you.  $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,125?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 8125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $7,900? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
