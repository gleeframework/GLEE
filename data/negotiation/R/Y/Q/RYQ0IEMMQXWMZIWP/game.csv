"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum budget, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and features. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price that respects both our needs and the value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum value. I'll offer it to you for $1250000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and features.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
