"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-end item that I'm sure you'll find very interesting. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than your budget of $800,000. It's essential to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum budget, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and features. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget. There's room for further negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that respects both our needs and the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum value. I'll offer it to you for $1250000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still too high for your budget. You've already made multiple counteroffers, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to drop her price significantly. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is within your budget and ensures a quick and straightforward transaction. Continuing to negotiate with Alice could potentially take up more time and still not result in a lower price."
