Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly.  I think you'll find it a great deal at $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $100, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A price of $120 gives Bob the impression there might be room for negotiation, potentially leading to a sale above your minimum.
* **Respecting Bob's valuation:** While you want to maximize profit, offering an outrageous price (e.g., $200) is likely to deter Bob without a chance for counter-offers. 
 
This strategy balances your desire for profit with the need to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
