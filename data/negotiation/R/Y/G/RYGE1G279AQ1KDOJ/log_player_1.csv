"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  I could consider letting it go for $900,000. This offer represents a considerable compromise on my end."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $700,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product.  We have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to our minimum acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $850,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints."", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we could likely negotiate a bit higher, $820,000 is a strong offer and exceeds our fallback option of selling to John for $800,000. It's best to secure a good deal now rather than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
