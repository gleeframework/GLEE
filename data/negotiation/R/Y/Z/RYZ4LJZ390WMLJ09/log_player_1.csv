"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the maximum price he's willing to pay, which is still below my minimum acceptable price. There's no room for negotiation to reach a price that works for me. It's better to sell to John at my desired price and avoid further back-and-forth."
