"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has immense potential, and I believe a price of $2,100,000 is a fair reflection of its value.  What do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $2,100,000 to me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,900,000. That's my best offer so far.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
