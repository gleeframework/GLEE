"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150.
* It's also a better deal than buying from John at $150. 
* Even though you could try to negotiate with Alice further, accepting her offer is the best choice to save money and get the product."
