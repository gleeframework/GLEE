"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500.  It's a great deal, and I think it's worth the price. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $8500 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $8250?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $8250 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to save some money on this purchase. Can you consider $7750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your need to save money, but $7750 is still significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm willing to compromise a little further, but I need to receive at least $8000 for this product. Let's split the difference – how about $7875?",7875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7875 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider $7500?",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere. I've come down significantly from my initial price, and $7500 is still below my minimum value. I'm willing to make one final compromise –  how about $7625? If you're not willing to go that high, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",7625.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7625 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider $7375?",7375.0,Bob,8,
