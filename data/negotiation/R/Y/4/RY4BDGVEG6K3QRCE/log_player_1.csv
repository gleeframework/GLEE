Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'm confident the product is valuable, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate but always have the option of selling to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is still a substantial amount, it's significantly lower than my initial asking price and below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price from $1,500,000 to $1,200,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the product's value. If he rejects this, I'll likely accept John's offer as the negotiation seems to be going lower than I initially thought."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to John's offer of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm not confident Bob will budge further, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. It's a solid profit, and I'm ready to accept it."
