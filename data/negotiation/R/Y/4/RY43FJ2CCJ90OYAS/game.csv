"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know if you're interested.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $100 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $110. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $110 is still outside my budget.  I can go up to $95.  Let's make a deal.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a small profit. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $97.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow you to make a small profit. What do you say?",97.5,Bob,8,
