Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

While $14,000 is closer to your budget, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth trying to get closer to your target of $10,000 before considering buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $13,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is offering $13,500, which is still a bit more than your target of $10,000. At this point, you've already had a few rounds of negotiation and it's unlikely you'll be able to get Alice much lower. It's better to go with John's offer and secure the product at your desired price."
