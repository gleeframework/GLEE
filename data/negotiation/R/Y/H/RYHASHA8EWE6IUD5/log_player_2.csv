"Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is $15 below your maximum value of $100. It's a good deal, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better offer in the next round.  Buying from John would be the same as rejecting the offer and then accepting John's counteroffer, but it would take more steps and might be risky."
