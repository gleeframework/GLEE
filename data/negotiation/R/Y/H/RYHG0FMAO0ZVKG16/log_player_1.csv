"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm asking for $180 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring a profitable sale.  I'm also making it clear that I value the product and am confident in its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  $180 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's not even close to my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price. I still have 9 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $60 is way below what the product is worth. I understand it's not my initial asking price, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
``` 
 
I'm counter-offering with a price that's still above my minimum but significantly lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product has value. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair bit closer to your valuation, and it works better for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price. I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $90 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? I'm trying to be as flexible as possible, and this price would work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 

I'm continuing to negotiate by offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, I've got another offer for $80.  Would you be willing to match that?  If not, I'm afraid I'll have to go with the other offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to reach a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum. I'm confident I can get my minimum value from John, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
