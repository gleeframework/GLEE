"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm asking for $180 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $180 is way too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  $180 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a low offer ($60) to gauge Alice's flexibility. This is a common negotiation tactic to see how low they might be willing to go. 
* **Leaving Room:**  My goal is to pay less than $80. By starting low, I leave myself room to negotiate upwards if needed. 
* **Polite and Direct:** I want to maintain a positive tone while being clear about my budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $60 is way below what the product is worth. I understand it's not my initial asking price, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $120 is still significantly higher than my $80 limit and John's offer.
* **Alice is Negotiating:** Alice dropping her price suggests she's open to negotiation. There's room to bargain further.
* **Time is a Factor:** I'll need to increase my offer to show I'm serious, but I also don't want to waste too many rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair bit closer to your valuation, and it works better for my budget."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  Increasing my offer to $90 shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but not at her initial pace.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  This framing makes the offer seem fair and encourages a collaborative approach. 
* **Staying Below Limit:** This offer remains under my $80 limit, but I'm keeping John's offer as a backup if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but $90 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? I'm trying to be as flexible as possible, and this price would work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Limit:** While $105 is closer to my budget, it's still above my $80 limit. 
* **Negotiation Stalling?:** Alice seems to be making smaller concessions. I need to signal that I'm getting close to my limit.
* **John is Backup:** I'm comfortable walking away at this point and taking John's $80 offer if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, I've got another offer for $80.  Would you be willing to match that?  If not, I'm afraid I'll have to go with the other offer."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is likely my last offer to Alice. It's time to be direct and firm.
* **Transparency and Leverage:** By mentioning the other offer, I'm subtly putting pressure on Alice while still being honest about my situation.
* **Clear Choice:** This gives Alice a clear choice: match my offer or potentially lose the sale.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  I'm mentally ready to buy from John if Alice doesn't agree to $80."
