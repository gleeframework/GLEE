Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents the high-end value for this product, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Bob's offer:

It's a difficult choice, but I'm better off taking the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risking Bob walking away and potentially getting stuck with the product."
