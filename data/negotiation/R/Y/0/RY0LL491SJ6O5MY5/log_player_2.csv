"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is too high. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider selling it for $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to start the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for compromise. By being polite and expressing continued interest, we hope to encourage Alice to engage in further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $85, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice came down a bit, we're still aiming for a better deal. There's room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77? That's a fair price for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 77
}
```

We're inching closer to a deal. This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's latest offer ($85) and our previous offer ($70). It shows willingness to compromise while still striving for a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can do $82, but that's as close to the middle as I can get. Would you be willing to meet me at $82? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet us somewhere in the middle, and $82 is a reasonable price, well below John's offer and saving us a decent amount. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
