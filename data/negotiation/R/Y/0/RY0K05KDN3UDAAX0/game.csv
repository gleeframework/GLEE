"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal considering the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,150,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is my last counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
