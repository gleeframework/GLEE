Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your asking price and my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider Bob's offer carefully. He's offering $14,000, which is a good amount above his perceived value of $12,000. However, it's still less than John's guaranteed offer of $15,000. 

Let's try to negotiate a bit more.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $14,000 is still lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000. This is a good compromise for both of us and I believe we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tricky spot. Bob is now offering the same amount as John. There's a chance I could get more from Bob, but it's also risky to keep pushing. 

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

It makes sense to accept Bob's offer at $15,000. It's better to take a sure thing than risk losing the sale entirely."
