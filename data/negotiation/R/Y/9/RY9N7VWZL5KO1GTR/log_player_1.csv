Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers and allows me to gauge his interest level. 

If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'll also keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price and below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,200,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to my initial offer.  It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I also value the product. I hope this price will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit and ensures a quick sale."
