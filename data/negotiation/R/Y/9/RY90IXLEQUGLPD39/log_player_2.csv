"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $900,000.  There's a good chance Alice will accept a counteroffer that is still profitable for her but closer to your ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $900,000, but still leaves her with a profit margin of $150,000, which is likely acceptable to her. This counteroffer shows that you are serious about negotiating and willing to pay a fair price, while also leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a decent price considering your goal is to save as much money as possible. Buying from Alice at this price will save you $350,000 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject your counteroffer and you could end up paying more or having to buy from John at a much higher price."
