Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price. The value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,110,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,110,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,080,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your understanding of the product's value. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,095,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,095,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Budget:** Alice's offer is within your budget of $1,200,000.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has declared this her final offer, so there's a chance you might not get a lower price if you reject.
* **Potential Savings:** Even though the price is above your ideal, it's still a $55,000 saving compared to buying from John. 

Given the limited rounds remaining (5), it's a good strategy to accept Alice's offer and secure the product while still achieving some savings."
