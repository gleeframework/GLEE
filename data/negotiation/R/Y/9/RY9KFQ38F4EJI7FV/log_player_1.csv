Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me is significantly higher. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), but high enough to give Bob a sense of potential value.
* **Message:** I'm friendly and positive, highlighting the potential benefit for Bob. I also mention my high valuation to subtly increase his sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

* **Start high, but not too high:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation without risking an immediate rejection. 
* **Be open to counteroffers:**  This shows flexibility and could potentially lead to a better deal.
* **Don't be afraid to walk away:** If negotiations stall or Bob becomes unreasonable, I have John as a backup, ensuring I don't settle for a price below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'd be willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $12,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss for me. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. 
* I'll likely lower my price slightly, but not too much, showing I'm willing to compromise but still value the product highly. 
* I'll continue to emphasize the product's value and potential benefits for Bob. 
* I'll also remind him that I have another buyer willing to pay a higher price to increase his urgency."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run. How about $10,500? It's still a great price considering what I could get from someone else. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've lowered my price to $10,500, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a fair price for me.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the value proposition for Bob. I'm also subtly reminding him about the alternative buyer to create a sense of urgency. 

**Strategy:**

* **Meet in the middle:**  I'm aiming for a compromise that is reasonable for both of us.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  This encourages a collaborative environment.
* **Don't be afraid to walk away:** I'm still aware of my minimum price and will be prepared to accept John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Can we make a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $10,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* While I would prefer a higher price, I need to weigh the potential benefits of a quick sale against the risk of further negotiations.  

**Strategy:**

* **Accept the offer:**  The risk of continuing negotiations is that Bob might become less interested, or I might end up lowering my price further. Accepting his offer now ensures a sale and a decent profit. 
* **Move on:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I can move on to other opportunities and potentially find better deals in the future."
