"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $15,000, but I want to see Bob's reaction first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm interested, but I'm only able to go up to $13000 right now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is above my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I want to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob, and I'm not at a point where I feel pressured to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. This price still allows me to make a profit while offering you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's lower than my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's. I'm showing flexibility while also maintaining some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for meeting me halfway. I'm still trying to stretch my budget.  How about $13250?  That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point, and we are halfway through the negotiation process. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and closes the deal quickly."
