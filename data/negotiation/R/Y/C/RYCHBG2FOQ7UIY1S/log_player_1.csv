"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but that's my final offer.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to Bob's desired price, $8,200 is still significantly below my minimum. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm starting to consider selling to John for the guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $8,200 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,600.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you. Let me know if you're willing to agree to this price."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8,600 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,400. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to get as close to my budget as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value for the product. It's better to guarantee the $10,000 from John than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price."
