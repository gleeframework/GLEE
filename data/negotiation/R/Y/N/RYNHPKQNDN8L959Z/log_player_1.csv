{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $1,200,000 is higher than Bob's value of $800,000, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's significantly below your minimum of $1,500,000, allowing you room to negotiate upwards if needed. 
* **It's a good first offer:** It shows you're serious about selling but also willing to be flexible. 

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while still protecting your minimum acceptable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is still below my minimum of $1,500,000.  While it's getting closer, the negotiation seems to be moving slowly. I'm concerned that further rounds will just prolong the process and I might not get the price I'm looking for.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000 to secure a fair price and avoid further negotiation."
