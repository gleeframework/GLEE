"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $120 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $105? This would still give you a good deal, and it would be closer to my minimum. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but I'm still aiming to pay less than $100. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going below $95. This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $90 is really the most I can do.  If you're not able to do $90, I understand, but I might have to look at other options."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm reiterating my firm offer of $90 while also subtly reminding Alice that I have another option if she remains inflexible."
