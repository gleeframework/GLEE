Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He'll accept any offer below this but would ideally want to pay less.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** The prices at which both you and Bob would agree lie between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you hold a strong position.  However, pushing Bob too close to his maximum might make him walk away, even if it's a good deal for him.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I've done my research and know it would be a valuable asset to your operations. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:**  The message is straightforward and emphasizes the product's value to Bob.
* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,350,000 is a strong opening within the ZOPA, giving you room to negotiate while still aiming for a significant profit. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can then negotiate down towards his maximum while ensuring you stay above your $1,500,000 minimum."
