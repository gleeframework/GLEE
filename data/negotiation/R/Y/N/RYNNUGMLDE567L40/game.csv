"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,600,000. I understand it's a valuable item for you, and this price reflects that.  However, I have another interested buyer who's willing to pay my minimum asking price of $1,500,000.  So this is a chance for you to secure it for a slightly higher price, but only if you act quickly.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
