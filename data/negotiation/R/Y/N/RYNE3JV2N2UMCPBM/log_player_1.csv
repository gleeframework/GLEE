Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I know it's a bit high, but I believe it's a fair price given its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The $175 offer leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Profit Maximization:**  Even if Bob negotiates you down slightly from $175, you'll still earn more than selling it to John directly. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product."
