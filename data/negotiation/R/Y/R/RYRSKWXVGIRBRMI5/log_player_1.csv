Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Strategic Pricing:** This price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($120) but below your guaranteed sale price. It gives Bob the illusion of a ""deal"" while maximizing your potential profit."
