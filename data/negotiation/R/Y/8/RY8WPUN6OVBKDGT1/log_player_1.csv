Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** The message highlights the ""unique value proposition,"" subtly implying the price is justified. 
* **Alternative:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, so I won't go lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum price and my initial offer.  Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John. It's highly likely we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $850,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This reflects the true value of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial drop from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate seriously. 
* **Holding Firm Above Bob's Value:** My new offer is still above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""fairness"" and ""true value"" to anchor the price psychologically. 
* **John as Leverage:** I'm still positioned to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet me closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I can go up to $925,000. This is a strong offer, and I hope we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching but Still Below:** Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, but $925,000 is still a significant amount below my minimum and what John is offering. 
* **Potential for More:**  His message suggests he might have some room to negotiate further (""strong offer,"" ""hope we can make a deal"").  
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John's offer ensures I don't feel pressured to accept a less profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I understand your budget constraints, $925,000 is still below the minimum I can accept. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,000,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair solution for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my last concession to signal the end of negotiations is near.
* **Meeting Bob's Value:**  I'm coming down to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), maximizing the chance he'll accept.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The message uses language like ""final concession"" and ""fair solution"" to convey seriousness while maintaining a positive tone.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'm ready to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
