"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your desired value, Alice. While $9,000 is better, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 as a final offer. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",8500.0,Alice,5,
