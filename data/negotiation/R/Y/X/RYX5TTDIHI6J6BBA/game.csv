"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product, but my budget is limited. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $1600000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise at $1700000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe the product's value justifies this price. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I'd like to propose a price of $1650000. I believe this offers a reasonable balance between the value of the product and my budget constraints. I hope this suggestion is acceptable to you.",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1650000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you a price of $1680000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1680000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I've carefully weighed the situation, and I'd like to propose a final price of $1660000. I believe this strikes a good balance between the product's value and my financial constraints. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",1660000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to budge any further. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe $1680000 is the lowest price I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but only if you're willing to meet me at $1700000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,7,
