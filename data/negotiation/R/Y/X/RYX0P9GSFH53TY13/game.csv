"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, as that's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,200 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm happy to offer $9,500 for the product.  It's a fair price that's right in the middle of our previous offers.  Let's close this deal and make it happen.",9500.0,Bob,6,
