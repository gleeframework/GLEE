"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is far too high.  Since your maximum budget is $8,000, it's not worth accepting this offer. You can do better by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, as that's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still too high. While it's closer to your budget, it's still $2,500 more than what you're willing to pay.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $10,200 is still too high. You're very close to your budget limit and it's worth pushing for a slightly lower price, especially since you have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,200 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm happy to offer $9,500 for the product.  It's a fair price that's right in the middle of our previous offers.  Let's close this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make another small concession and offer the product to you for $10,100. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still offering a price that's above your budget. While it's tempting to accept, there are still rounds left to negotiate. You can try to push for a lower price, and if unsuccessful, you can always fall back on buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,100 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,750 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,050. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has made a final offer of $10,050. This is still $2,050 above your budget and only $50 less than her previous offer.  With only one round left, it's unlikely you'll be able to get her to go lower.  At this point, it's more advantageous to purchase the product from John for $8,000 and avoid risking another round of negotiation."
