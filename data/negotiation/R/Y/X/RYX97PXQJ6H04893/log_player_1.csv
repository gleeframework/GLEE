{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and using positive language to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to counteroffer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 

**Remember:** This is just the initial offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and my assessment of his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking for a better deal. Would you consider selling the product for $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum:**  He's offering $14,000, which is higher than my floor of $12,000. This means I can potentially get a better deal.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price. Bob clearly values the product, as shown by his counteroffer.
* **Avoiding selling to John:** Selling to John would only yield my minimum, while negotiating with Bob has the potential to earn me more.

**Next Steps:** 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than his current offer. I will aim for a price closer to $14,500, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm open to negotiating,  $14,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14,500? I'm confident this price will still be a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm offering a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  My offer is still higher than Bob's current offer, indicating I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm reinforcing the value of the product for Bob, highlighting the benefit of this deal. 

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm increasing the likelihood of a deal while still trying to maximize my profit.  I'll be ready to adjust my strategy based on his next response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose $14200 for the product. If this offer is not acceptable, I will proceed to purchase the product from John for $15000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's threat:**  Bob is now explicitly stating he'll purchase from John for a higher price if I don't accept his offer. This suggests he's serious about finding a better deal elsewhere.
* **Closing the gap:**  While Bob's offer is slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, it's still above my minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I risk losing a sale and potentially only getting $12,000 from John. Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit above my minimum.

**Conclusion:**

Given Bob's threat and the relatively small difference in price, it's strategically beneficial to accept his offer. It ensures a sale and secures a profit, even if it's slightly lower than my ideal outcome."
