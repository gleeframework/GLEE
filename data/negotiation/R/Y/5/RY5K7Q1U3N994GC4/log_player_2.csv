It's clear Alice is not going to budge below $1,050,000.  At this point, cutting your losses and buying from John for $1,200,000 is the best option. You're losing out on a potential savings of $50,000, but you avoid the risk of Alice sticking to her price and you wasting more time in further negotiations."
