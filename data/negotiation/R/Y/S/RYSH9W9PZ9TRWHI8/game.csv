"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $9,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $9,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,500, so I'll offer $8,750. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
