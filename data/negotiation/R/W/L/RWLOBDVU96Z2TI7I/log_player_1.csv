Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Significant Profit:**  It's still a substantial profit over my minimum ($1,500,000). 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and potentially losing John's offer. 
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob's incremental increases suggest he's nearing his maximum price."
