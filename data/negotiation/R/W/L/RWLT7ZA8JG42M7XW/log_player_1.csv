Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Value & Certainty:** Selling to Bob quickly at $9,000 is preferable to potentially negotiating with John or waiting for another buyer.

This approach balances ambition with a realistic understanding of Bob's potential response."
