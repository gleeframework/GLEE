"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I can offer you a compromise - I can sell the product to you for $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I can meet you halfway at $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $11500. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope you'll consider it.",11500.0,Alice,7,
