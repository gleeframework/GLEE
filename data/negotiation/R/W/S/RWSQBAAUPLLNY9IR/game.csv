"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. My initial price is $2,000,000. This reflects the product's exceptional quality and potential. I'm open to discussing a fair price that benefits both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $2,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think a more reasonable price would be around $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and split the difference between your initial offer and my target price. Can you consider a price of $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $1,600,000 doesn't reflect the true worth of this product.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'll accept $1,800,000.  This price allows both of us to gain value from the deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,800,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I think we can find a better middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,700,000. Can you consider this price?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
