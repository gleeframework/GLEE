"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for this product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is close to my minimum, I'm going to try to get a better price.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
``` 
 
 I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of our previous offers. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we settle on $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $90.  While it's still a bit lower than I initially hoped for, it's getting closer to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  I'm also concerned about the time limit and don't want to risk getting stuck with John's offer of $80."
