**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $15,000.

* By rejecting, you can try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is willing to sell for $10,000, so I'm offering slightly above that.
* This price is still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and within my budget.
* It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
