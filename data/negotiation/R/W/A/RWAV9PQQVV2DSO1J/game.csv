"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet halfway at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,500,000. Would you consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for staying with me on this. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is still a significant discount from its real worth. How about we settle at $1,475,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1475000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, you've been great to work with, and I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer at $1,500,000.  Could you meet me at $1,460,000? That's my final offer.",1460000.0,Alice,7,
