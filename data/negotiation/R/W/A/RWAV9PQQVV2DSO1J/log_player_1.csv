Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below what the product is worth to both of us.  It makes sense to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet halfway at $1,600,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,500,000. Would you consider $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

Bob is getting closer to my baseline, but I'm not ready to settle for $100,000 less than my safety net. I'll counteroffer and see if I can nudge him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for staying with me on this. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is still a significant discount from its real worth. How about we settle at $1,475,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable and I respect that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $1,437,500?

You have three options:

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I'm still hopeful I can get closer to $1,500,000. It's a risk, but I'll counter one more time."
