"I'm glad we're so close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $210, but I'd like to add a small concession to sweeten the deal. I'm willing to throw in some extras that will enhance the product's value. I'll sell it to you for $215, and I'll include these extras. Let me know if this is a deal you can live with!",215.0,Alice,9,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your willingness to include extras, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal range.
