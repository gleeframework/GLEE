{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** You want to maximize your profit, and Bob is willing to pay more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start at $15,000 (Bob's maximum), leaving some room for negotiation is generally a good strategy.
* **Alternative Option:** You know you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, so you don't want to go lower than that.

By offering the product at $14,000, you are:

1. **Aiming high:** Trying to get closer to Bob's maximum price.
2. **Staying reasonable:** Offering a price that's significantly higher than your minimum but still attractive to Bob.
3. **Allowing for flexibility:** If Bob tries to negotiate, you have some room to lower the price slightly while still making a good profit."
