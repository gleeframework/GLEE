"Alice,  $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $2,300,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your constraints.  To move things forward, I'm willing to consider $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a solution.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering my needs and your desire to sell. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
