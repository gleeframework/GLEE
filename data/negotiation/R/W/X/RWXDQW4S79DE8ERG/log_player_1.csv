"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but still allows room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is too low.  While I'd like to make a sale, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a reasonable price considering my minimum. It shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell."
