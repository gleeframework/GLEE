"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product is valuable, but not quite at that level for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $800,000 is a good offer, it's a little lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. Let's make this deal happen!",1000000.0,Alice,3,
