# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $800,000 is a good offer, it's a little lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. Let's make this deal happen!

Alice is not budging from her $1,000,000 price. Since John will sell it for the same price, there's no point in continuing the negotiation. It's time to move on."
