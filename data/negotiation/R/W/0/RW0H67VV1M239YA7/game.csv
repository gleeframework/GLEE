"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer who is also interested in purchasing the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
