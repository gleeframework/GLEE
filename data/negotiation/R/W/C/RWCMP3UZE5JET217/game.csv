"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,250,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? ",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise a bit more. However, $1,150,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This price is fair, considering the value you place on the product and my need to make a profit.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
