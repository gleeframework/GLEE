"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,350,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a significant profit for you, given your value of $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. This product holds exceptional value, and I'm confident it will more than prove its worth to you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still above what I can reasonably afford at this time.  Considering the value you place on the product and my desire to acquire it, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This offer remains fair to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
