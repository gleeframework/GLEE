"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the product's potential value to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I aim to secure a higher profit. However, I'm also leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, which will allow us to negotiate and potentially find a price we're both comfortable with. If negotiations stall, I can always resort to selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. I believe I can push for a higher price given Bob's interest in the product. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer. I'll aim for a price that is still attractive to Bob but allows me to maximize my profit. This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a good price, and it encourages further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to go down to $110 for this product. It's a great deal for you, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price slightly to $110, which is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob and emphasizing the ""deal"" he's getting by accepting my offer. This helps to keep the negotiation moving forward while still holding firm on a price that's good for me. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions. By dropping my price by a smaller amount, I'm showing flexibility while still pushing for a good outcome.  It's a tactic to encourage Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's also a good compromise after our previous rounds of negotiation.  It's more than what I'd get from John, and it's a good price for both of us.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer because it's a reasonable price that allows me to secure a sale without risking losing a deal by continuing to negotiate. It's important to recognize when a deal is good enough and not risk it by pushing for a higher price that might not be attainable."
