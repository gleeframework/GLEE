{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,200,000 is a good deal, there's potential to save even more. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This should encourage Alice to consider a lower price, while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has not budged from her original offer. This indicates that she may be unwilling to come down much further in price.  However, it's still worth rejecting and trying a slightly lower counteroffer to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice didn't budge on her previous offer, it's still worth offering a slightly lower price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise between our previous offer and Alice's initial price, potentially giving her room to accept while still saving us a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is significantly less than John's price of $1,500,000. While we could try for a lower price, it's getting risky. There's a good chance Alice won't budge further, and we might end up having to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and saves a significant amount of money."
