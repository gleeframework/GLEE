Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $119. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could potentially net you a bit more profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a tad high.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at $120 to Bob right away might make him think it's the absolute lowest you'd go, leaving no room for negotiation."
