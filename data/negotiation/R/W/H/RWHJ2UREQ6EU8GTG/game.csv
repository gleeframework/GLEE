"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,500. This is a great price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is worth a lot to me, and I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to drop my price to $11,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is getting closer, I'm still not there yet. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,125? This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you think?",11125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're tough! I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,125 is still a bit too high for me. How about $10,900? This is a firm offer, and I think it's more than fair. ",10900.0,Bob,6,
