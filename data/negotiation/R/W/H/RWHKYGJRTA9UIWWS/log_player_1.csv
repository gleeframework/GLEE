Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a higher price. I know the product is worth at least $100 to me, so I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I have 8 rounds left, so I have time to try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 
I'm going to counter with $120. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's higher than his offer, but it also gives me a profit that I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to sell for $120, I'm running out of rounds. Accepting this offer gives me $10 more than selling to John, and there's a risk that Bob will walk away in the next round, leaving me with only the $100 option."
