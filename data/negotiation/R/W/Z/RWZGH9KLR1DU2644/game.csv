"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $12000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13500. This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $13000 for the product. This aligns more closely with my budget while still providing a fair value for both parties. I look forward to your response.",13000.0,Bob,4,
