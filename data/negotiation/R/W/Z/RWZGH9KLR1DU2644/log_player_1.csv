"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, making the negotiation feel collaborative. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and keeping the negotiation open for potential compromise in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, it's important to consider the opportunity cost.  If I can get a better price from Bob, I'll be able to maximize my earnings. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my ideal value, but still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price by $500 from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still protecting my bottom line.
* **Emphasize Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value, reiterating that my offer still provides him a good deal.
* **Reiterate Needs:**  I subtly highlight that I need a certain price to make the sale worthwhile. 

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a gradual, incremental approach to negotiation.  By lowering my price in smaller increments, I hope to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $13000 for the product. This aligns more closely with my budget while still providing a fair value for both parties. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $500 away from my minimum acceptable price of $12,500. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're already in round 4, leaving only 6 rounds remaining.  The longer we negotiate, the greater the risk of Bob walking away or finding another seller.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I can sell to John for $15,000, it's uncertain if I can get a higher price from Bob in the remaining rounds.

**Conclusion:**  At this point, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision. It secures a profit for me, avoids further negotiation, and minimizes the risk of losing the deal."
