Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (John), you start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your guaranteed sale price.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, still landing you a significantly higher profit than selling at his perceived value. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy. You could experiment with different opening offers and messages to see how Bob might respond."
