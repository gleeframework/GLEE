"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I know you've been interested in.  My initial price is $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from it.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Considering the value of this product to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. However, $850,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a little further to $900,000, which I think is still a very fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to close this.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on this product.  What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
