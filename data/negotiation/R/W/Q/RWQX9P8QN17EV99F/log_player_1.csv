Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I know you've been interested in.  My initial price is $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Considering the value of this product to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $850,000 is too low, especially since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to him. I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. However, $850,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a little further to $900,000, which I think is still a very fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to close this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $850,000 is tempting, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price.  I have a few more rounds, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
