"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'll start with a price that's a bit higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 110}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than the minimum he's willing to pay, and this price should give him some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is higher than my minimum price, but I'm not sure I'm willing to settle for $105. I'll choose option 2 and reject Bob's offer. I'll send a counteroffer that's higher than his offer, but still lower than my minimum price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 108}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."

Round 3

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me at or near my minimum price, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation."

I'm trying to get as close to my minimum price as possible while still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate."
