"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below the product's value to me, and I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell to John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for its value.  I'm confident this deal will be beneficial for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
