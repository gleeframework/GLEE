"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $100? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $90? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",90.0,Alice,5,
