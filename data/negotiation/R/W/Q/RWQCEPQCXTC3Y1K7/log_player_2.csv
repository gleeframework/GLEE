"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a one-time price of $120. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards towards our budget while still aiming for a price well below Alice's valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $100? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above your budget and what John offers. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

This counter-offer splits the difference between her last offer and our previous one.  It keeps the negotiation moving and aims for a price that's beneficial for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $90? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower and reaching an agreement below $80 seems improbable now. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John at the price we know is fair."
