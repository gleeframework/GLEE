"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it holds immense value for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $900,000, reflecting its quality and potential. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. Would you be open to something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This price reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to stay above $800,000.  Let's meet at $825,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell this product is important to you, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,6,
