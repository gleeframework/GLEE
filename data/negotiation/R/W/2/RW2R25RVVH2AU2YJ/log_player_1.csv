(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $8,000, I know the product is worth more to him. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $9,000? This would still give you a good deal and I'd be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe Bob can pay more. I'm going to continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still a little hesitant at that price. Let's try $9,500.  That's a good compromise, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
