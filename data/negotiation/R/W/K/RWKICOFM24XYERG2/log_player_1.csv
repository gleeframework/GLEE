"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price ($100) because I want to maximize my profit. I'm also framing it positively, highlighting the value of the product.  We'll see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's at my minimum price. While I could sell to John now, I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob.  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $85, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, $82 is a good compromise, and it's only $2 less than what I could get from John.  It's worth closing the deal now and avoiding further rounds of negotiation."
