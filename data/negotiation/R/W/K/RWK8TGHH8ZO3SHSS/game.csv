"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,000,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it's a fair price for me. Let's work together and finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
