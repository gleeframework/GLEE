"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $18,000 is higher than your maximum valuation of $15,000. You can definitely negotiate for a better price. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down before resorting to buying from John at your maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is a good deal. You're saving $1,000 from your maximum budget and avoiding the risk of further negotiation. It's unlikely you'll get Alice much lower, and going back and forth might make her less willing to compromise."
