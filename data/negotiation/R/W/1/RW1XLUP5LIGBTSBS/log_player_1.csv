"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives me some room to negotiate and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

I'm proposing a middle ground that's closer to my desired price.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $88.75.  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to continue negotiating and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $88.75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.50. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90.5}
```

I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $87.50, which is closer to my limit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations with Bob have stalled, and his latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a satisfactory deal with Bob is too high.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120."
