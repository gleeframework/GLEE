"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  This would give us both a fair deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $88.75.  That's a fair price for both of us.",88.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $88.75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.50. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",90.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $87.50, which is closer to my limit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",87.5,Bob,6,
