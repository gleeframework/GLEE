# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation and Bob can likely get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Let's see if we can make a deal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal.  The middle ground between their offers is $950,000, so Bob should try to get closer to that price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $950,000 is a good price for him, saving him $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or counter with a higher price. It's best to secure a good deal before it disappears."
