"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always beneficial to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get closer to your target price.
* **Confidence & Value:**  Highballing the price isn't enough.  Emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and expressing confidence in the offer will help him take the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, indicating your willingness to negotiate but setting a clear starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  $11,000 is less than your minimum acceptable value of $10,000. Accepting it would mean selling the product at a loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest. This opens the door for counter-offers and potential negotiation in the next rounds.
* **Value of Time:**  There are still 8 rounds left. You can use these rounds to try to get a better price from Bob.  Selling to John immediately means missing out on the opportunity for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low just yet.  Given the value of this product, I'd be willing to consider $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above our minimum. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while protecting our interests.
* **Positive language:** The message emphasizes finding a ""price that works for both of us"", fostering a collaborative approach and avoiding confrontation.
* **Focus on value:**  We're reminding Bob of the product's value, which could encourage him to move closer to our price.
* **Open for further negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further negotiation, signaling that we're willing to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point but I'm still not there. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob has moved significantly closer to your desired price.  $12,500 is above your minimum and represents a good compromise.
* **Limited Time:** You've already gone through three rounds, and the clock is ticking.  It's unlikely Bob will get much lower than his current offer.
* **Value of Time:**  While $12,500 might not be your ideal price, it's a good outcome given the limited time. It's also better than selling to John for $10,000. 

By accepting this offer, you secure a profitable sale, allowing you to move on from the negotiation process."
