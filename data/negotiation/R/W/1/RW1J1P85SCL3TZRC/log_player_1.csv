{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I want to see if I can get a higher price before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is better than my minimum, I think I can still get a higher price. I'll try to negotiate a bit closer to my initial offer."

I'm counteroffering at $16,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still leaves me with a decent profit."

I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this price will be acceptable to Bob and we can finalize the deal."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  The negotiations with Bob have gone on for a while and haven't yielded a price I'm comfortable with. I'm getting closer to my minimum, but it's not worth risking further negotiation when I have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John."
