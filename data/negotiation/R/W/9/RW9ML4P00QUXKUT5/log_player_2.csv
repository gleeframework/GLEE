"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $170 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're only willing to pay up to $120, and she's asking for $170. 
* **Negotiation is necessary.**  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $170 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  You're only willing to pay up to $120, and she's asking for $140. 
* **Negotiation is still necessary.**  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John. While you could accept and save a bit of money compared to buying from John, you're still paying more than you'd like."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 130}
