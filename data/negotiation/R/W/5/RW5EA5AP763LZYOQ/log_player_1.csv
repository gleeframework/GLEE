"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 13000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This will gauge his interest and potential willingness to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway, offering a price that's closer to his offer but still significantly higher than his initial value. This shows a willingness to compromise, but keeps the price above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to settle for that price.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my target price.  I have John as a backup option, but I'm not ready to give up on this deal yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly again, but still maintain a price above my minimum value. I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is now at my minimum value, but I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation and haven't seen much movement from him. There are only 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low. John is a guaranteed sale at my target price, so I'm going to take the safe option."
