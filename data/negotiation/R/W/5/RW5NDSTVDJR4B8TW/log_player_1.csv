{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price point, as it's unlikely Bob will accept this offer, but it sets a clear starting point for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but my budget is limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value for the product.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120 to make this work. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to make a counteroffer that's closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, Alice. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible for us to agree on $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my last counteroffer of $107.50.  It's still above my minimum of $150, and while I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price point, it's not worth risking losing the sale entirely by rejecting his offer and potentially going back and forth for more rounds.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
