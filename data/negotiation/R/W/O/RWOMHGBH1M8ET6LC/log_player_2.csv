**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth pursuing a counteroffer to see if we can get closer to our target price of $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer. This takes into account your needs while still ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my target price before resorting to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $1,000,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for. However, I still need to receive a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 as a final offer.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve a positive outcome. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. At this point, I'm better off buying the product from John for $800,000. It's a guaranteed deal that fits my financial constraints."
