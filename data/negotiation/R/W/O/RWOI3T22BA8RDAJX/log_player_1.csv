"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I can likely get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a great product that you'll get a lot of use out of, and this price reflects that. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get closer to my desired price with Bob,  selling to John guarantees me my minimum target price of $120."
