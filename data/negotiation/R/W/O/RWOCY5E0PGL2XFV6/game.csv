"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,000,000 is too far below the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. It's still a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. Let's make this deal happen!",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're eager to make a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still too far from what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but I need to see some movement from your end. This is a final offer, and if we don't reach an agreement, I'll be forced to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
