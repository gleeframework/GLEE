"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and makes you appear less desperate to sell quickly. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth, aiming to anchor his perception closer to my asking price.
* **Leaving Room:** While the offer is high, it's not astronomically far from Bob's perceived value. This leaves space for a counteroffer and keeps Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still aiming to get closer to my minimum of $1,000,000. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's serious about the product and willing to negotiate. I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm looking for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value of this product is truly significant. To meet somewhere in the middle, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,175,000."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've come down a significant amount from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to make a deal.
* **Middle Ground:** This price sits roughly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling a compromise.
* **Strong Stance:** I'm still aiming high, as I believe the product's value justifies a price above $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I will consider it, but based on my budget, I think we can still find a middle ground. Let's aim for $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Strong Offer:** This is a substantial increase from his previous offer and demonstrates his strong interest in the product.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result, and risks Bob walking away or me missing out on a guaranteed sale.  It's better to secure a good deal now."
