"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, based on my budget and the current market conditions, I am unable to accept $1800000 for the product. I would like to propose a price of $1650000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1650000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest offer and, while I appreciate the compromise, I must respectfully decline at this time. I am still unable to meet at $1700000. My maximum budget remains at $1650000. I hope this final offer will be acceptable to you.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
