Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and allows you to benefit significantly from its acquisition."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price significantly higher than John's offer ($1,000,000) to maximize your potential earnings.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for you while still presenting a compelling deal for Bob, who values it at $1,500,000.
* **Confident Negotiation:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, justifying the price and encouraging Bob to accept. 

By starting at this strong yet reasonable price, you leave room for potential negotiation while ensuring you don't undervalue your product."
