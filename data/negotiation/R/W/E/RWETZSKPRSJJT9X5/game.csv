"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with an offer of $9500.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $9500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $7500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you a price of $8250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8250 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8000.  This is my absolute top end, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us considering the value of the product.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $8200. This is my final compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",8200.0,Alice,5,
