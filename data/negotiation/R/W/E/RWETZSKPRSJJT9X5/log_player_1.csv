Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $9500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $7500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
