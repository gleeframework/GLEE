"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product, which still reflects a significant value for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1450000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1450000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, which is a significant investment for me and a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you at $1420000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",1420000.0,Alice,5,
