```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1450000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant investment for me and a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you at $1420000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,420,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,420,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,420,000 is within my budget and only $20,000 more than my last counteroffer. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in minor price reductions, and I'm close to my maximum limit.  It's a good deal considering the value of the product to me, so I'll accept it."
