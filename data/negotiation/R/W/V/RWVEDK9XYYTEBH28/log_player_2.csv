``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  While Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000, Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000. This saves Bob $100,000.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer is worse:** Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob has to buy from John for $1,200,000, which is the full amount he's willing to pay.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best decision for Bob as it allows him to save money."
