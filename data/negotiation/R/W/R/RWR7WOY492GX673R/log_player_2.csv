"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We're excited to offer it to you at a price of $12,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still too high for Bob, as he is only willing to pay $8,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. We're getting close, but we're still not quite there. We're willing to make one more concession.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,800 is significantly lower than her initial price and closer to Bob's target, it's still a bit higher than he's willing to pay. Bob has 3 rounds left, but he's also aware that he has a backup option with John, who is willing to sell the product for $8,000. Given the limited time and the availability of a cheaper alternative, Bob decides to take the safe route and buy the product from John."
