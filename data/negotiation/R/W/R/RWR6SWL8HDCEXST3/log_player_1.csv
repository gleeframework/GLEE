Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4

We're still significantly below the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can negotiate further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable.  How about $775,000?

While ideally we'd get closer to $800,000, Bob is unlikely to go much higher and we are quickly approaching our fallback price with John. Accepting $775,000 ensures a good profit without risking a stalled negotiation."
