"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means.",950000.0,Bob,4,
