Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits it holds. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your business, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, recognizing the potential value this product can offer.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little higher. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  $1,050,000 is a good offer, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a very reasonable compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we've been going back and forth for a while.  At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
