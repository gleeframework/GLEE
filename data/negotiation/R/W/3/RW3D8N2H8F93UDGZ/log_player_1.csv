Bob's offer is too low. I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price, and it's worth taking a few more rounds to see if we can reach an agreement."

Bob is unwilling to budge from his price, and I've already made significant concessions.  It's getting late in the negotiations and I don't want to risk going further and potentially getting a lower price than what John is offering. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
