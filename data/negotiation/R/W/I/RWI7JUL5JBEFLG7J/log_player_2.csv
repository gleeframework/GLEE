"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you, given its features and potential. I'm asking for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is below Bob's maximum budget, it's still too high.  He wants to see if he can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $13,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  Bob is making a significant counteroffer, going down $3,000 from Alice's initial price. This demonstrates his seriousness in negotiating while also leaving room for compromise.
* **Message:** Bob acknowledges Alice's offer but maintains a firm stance on his budget.  He also expresses appreciation, building a positive rapport.
* **Goal:** The counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $11,500 is closer to his target, it's still above his preferred range.  He has rounds left and wants to see if he can push for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}

* **Message:** He reinforces his willingness to compromise while also expressing his conviction that the offer is fair.
* **Goal:**  Bob wants to close the gap and find a deal that works for both parties, maximizing his savings."
