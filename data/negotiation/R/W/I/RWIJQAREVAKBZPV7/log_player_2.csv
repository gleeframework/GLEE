Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and a good starting point for negotiation. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice counters."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm raising my price to $1,000,000, acknowledging that we are in the final stages of negotiation and time is running out. 

* **Why this amount:** This offer is a significant increase from my previous counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. It also shows that I am serious about purchasing the product.  
* **Balancing risk:**  If Alice rejects this, I still have the option to buy from John, but at a higher price. 

This counteroffer is a calculated risk, aiming to strike a balance between securing a deal and minimizing my cost."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is our final round, and Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is only $75,000 above my last counteroffer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000. 

It's time to accept and finalize the purchase to avoid further negotiations and potential delays."
