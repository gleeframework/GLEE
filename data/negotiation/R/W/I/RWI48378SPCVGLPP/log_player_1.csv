This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives him room to negotiate and still leaves me some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."

{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'd be happy to go down to $105, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. I would like to propose $100 as my maximum offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $120 I can get from John.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but also acknowledge Bob's willingness to move."
