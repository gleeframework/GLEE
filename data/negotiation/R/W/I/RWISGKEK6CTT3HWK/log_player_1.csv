{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer of $107 is getting closer, but with only a few rounds left, it's not worth the risk of losing more money trying to squeeze out another few dollars. John is a guaranteed $120, which is closer to my desired price and more secure than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
