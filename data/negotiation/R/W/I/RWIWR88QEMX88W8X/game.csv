"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000?  This price still allows you to save some money while ensuring I get a fair value for my product.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I don't want to go too far above my budget.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for both of us. Let's try one more time. How about $950,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my own needs.  It's also closer to your last offer, so I think it could be a good compromise.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $937,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",937500.0,Bob,6,
