"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $2,200,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's best to reject the offer and start negotiating. There are 10 rounds available, so there's plenty of time to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is well above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  This is my maximum, so I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your current proposal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,600,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price. It's also worth noting that Bob can always buy from John for $1,000,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This reflects the real value of the product to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product's intrinsic value and market potential warrant a higher price. Let's find a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,450,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $1,450,000 is still beyond Bob's budget.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his $1,000,000 limit.  Remember, Bob can always buy from John, so there's no rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate the compromise,  $1,450,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This represents a significant commitment from me, and I hope it's a reasonable compromise for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be fair,  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down further, $1,375,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate. He's already shown a willingness to move closer to Alice's price, so there's potential for a successful counteroffer. Additionally, Bob always has the option of buying from John, which provides a safety net."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting close.  While I value this product, $1,375,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is a significant jump for me, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. "", ""product_price"": 1350000}
