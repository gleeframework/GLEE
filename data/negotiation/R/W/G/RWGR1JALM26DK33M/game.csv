"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this exceptional product to you for $18,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $12,000? It's a fair price for a product of this caliber.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a stretch for me.  I could potentially do $9,500.  That's a significant jump from my last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about $11,000? It's a bit closer to my minimum, and I think it's a reasonable compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and land at $10,500?  That's the best I can do.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $11,500? It's a bit of a stretch for you, but I think it's a fair price for a product of this quality.",11500.0,Alice,7,
