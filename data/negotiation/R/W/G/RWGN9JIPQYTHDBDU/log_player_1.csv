"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $875,000 is tempting, I believe we can still reach a more favorable price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to close this deal, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $890,000 as a final compromise.  Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $890,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally like to get a higher price, with only 4 rounds remaining and Bob's offers not moving much higher, I think accepting his offer for $880,000 is the best choice.  It's still a significant profit for me, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether and having to settle for John's offer of $800,000."
