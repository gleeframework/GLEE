Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is above what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves some room for negotiation. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's worth more than $75 to me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150} 
```

I'm going to counter with $150. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as I can always sell to John for that price.  This is also a fair compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'd prefer and what I know I can get from John. Since I'm confident I can secure a better deal with John, I'm going to sell to him for $150."
