# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product at a competitive price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer is too high ($1,000,000) for your budget of $800,000.
* You have the opportunity to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price. 
* Buying from John would be the best option if you can't negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to pay closer to $800,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still above your budget. 
*  You've already made several counteroffers and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but it seems she's not going to go lower than $950,000. 
* To avoid further negotiation that might not result in a price you're comfortable with, you're better off buying from John at the fixed price of $800,000. This ensures you get the product at your desired price point."
