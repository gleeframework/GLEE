"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",850000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a good value for you.",950000.0,Alice,5,,
