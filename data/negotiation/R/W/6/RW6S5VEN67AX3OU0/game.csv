"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $950000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less.  I'm happy to pay $850000.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
