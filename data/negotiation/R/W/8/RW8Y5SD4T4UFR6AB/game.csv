Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.,900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest in this product. While I see the value, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be very beneficial to my business.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950000. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value this product and see its potential, $950000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you at $850000. This price reflects the product's worth to me and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $920000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to your business.",920000.0,Alice,5,
