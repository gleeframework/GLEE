This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly lower than Bob's value but still significantly higher than my minimum. This allows for room to potentially negotiate further while also ensuring I get a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to go $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer. While it's still above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I will counteroffer to see if we can find a more mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
