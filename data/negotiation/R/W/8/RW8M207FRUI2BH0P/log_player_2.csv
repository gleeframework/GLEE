# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $90. This is a great deal, as I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $90.** This is better than buying from John for $100. 
* **Your goal is to save money.**  Even though the product is worth $100 to you, getting it for $90 is a good deal."
