Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's something you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $100.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher asking price in a negotiation. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering a price of $100, we're ""anchoring"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to $100 than if we started at $85.
* **Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the offer."
