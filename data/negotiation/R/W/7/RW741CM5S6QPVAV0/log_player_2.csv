```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  I'm prepared to sell the product for $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a substantial return on your investment. Let's see if we can make this work.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This price is fair and allows us both to walk away with a satisfactory deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $850000. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This price is fair to both of us, allowing me to make a profit and you to secure a valuable asset.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price, but if I don't get a better offer soon, I'll likely switch to buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $975000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  This is my final offer, and it's up to you to decide.  I'm sure you'll agree that this product is worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $975,000 is still too high for me. I'm better off buying the product from John for $800,000 to stay within my budget.  While I might have been able to squeeze out a slightly better price with more negotiation, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice isn't worth it."
