"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $9,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a decent price, you can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price but is still above her minimum. It shows you're serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.
* **Provides justification:**  The message explains why you're making the counteroffer, highlighting fairness for both sides. 
* **Sets the stage for further negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to potentially counter again, keeping the negotiation alive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, $8,500 is a bit below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle is a good compromise:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $9,000 is a fair compromise. 
* **Time is a factor:** You've already had two rounds of negotiation, and you want to avoid further rounds if possible. 
* **John's price is a threat:**  While $9,000 isn't your ideal price, it's significantly better than buying from John at $10,000."
