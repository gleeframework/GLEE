Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
