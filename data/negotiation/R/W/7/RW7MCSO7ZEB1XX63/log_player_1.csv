""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's maximum allows for potential negotiation if he tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $9,500 is a substantial profit over John's guaranteed $8,000 offer."
