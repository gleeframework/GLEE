Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $115. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems unlikely to move much higher than his $112 offer.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting even less. Accepting John's offer guarantees the $120 value."
