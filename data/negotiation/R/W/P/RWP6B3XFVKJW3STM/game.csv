"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the chance to discuss this product. While I do see its potential, I'm not quite ready to pay $1,200,000 at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it, which still leaves room for you to make a healthy profit. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. Considering your willingness to pay $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
