Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that is slightly higher than that. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 85}

I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $80. Since this is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option 1 and accept Bob's offer. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll sell the product to Bob for $80."
