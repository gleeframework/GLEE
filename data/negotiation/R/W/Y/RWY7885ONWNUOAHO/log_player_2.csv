The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $12,000. This is more than Bob is willing to pay. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering Alice $9,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from her original price, but still within my budget and potentially a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,500.  This is a compromise, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but still within my budget."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still more than I'm willing to pay, and I've already made several counteroffers.  It's likely further negotiation will be difficult, and it's best to save time and effort by buying from John at the price I'm comfortable with."
