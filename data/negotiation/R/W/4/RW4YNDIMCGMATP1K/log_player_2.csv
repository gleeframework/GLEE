"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to you ($80), it's still lower than John's price ($120). 
* **Saving money is the goal:** Accepting Alice's offer means you save $10 compared to buying from John."
