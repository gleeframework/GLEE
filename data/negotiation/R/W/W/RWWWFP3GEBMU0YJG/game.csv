"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can do $10,500 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
