"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its value to you, we are offering it at a special introductory price of $12,000. This represents a significant saving compared to its full value of $15,000 and an opportunity not to be missed. Please let me know if this offer aligns with your budget and needs, so we can proceed to finalize the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. You can then try to negotiate a lower price, knowing you have the backup option of buying from John for $15,000."
