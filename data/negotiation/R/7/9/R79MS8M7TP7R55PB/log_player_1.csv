{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a truly unique opportunity and I believe it holds significant value for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen a price higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) but not excessively high to avoid immediate rejection.  The message is friendly and highlights the product's potential value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 

Remember, this is just the first step.  We'll need to adapt our strategy based on Bob's response and how the negotiation unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. Bob's initial offer is too low and doesn't reflect the potential value I see in the product. I want to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe a price closer to $1,400,000 reflects the product's true value. This would allow me to make this deal work and leave room for both of us to benefit. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm sticking to my goal of earning more than my minimum while acknowledging Bob's financial constraint. By suggesting a compromise price ($1,400,000), I'm showing flexibility and hoping to reach an agreement without alienating Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $1300000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum and closer to the price I initially offered. While I would have liked to get closer to my ideal price, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure a profit now than potentially lose out on the sale."
