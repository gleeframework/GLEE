"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very good price, and I think you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we consider a price closer to $700,000? I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",850000.0,Alice,5,
