"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is higher to you, but based on my needs and budget, I am unable to agree to $18000. Would you consider lowering the price closer to the value I place on it, which is $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
