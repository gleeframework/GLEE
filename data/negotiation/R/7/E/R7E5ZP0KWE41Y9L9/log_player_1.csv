Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer Bob a price that's attractive enough to accept but also maximizes your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to be a bit bolder in your initial offer.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** This offer starts closer to your minimum acceptable price, aiming to anchor the negotiation higher.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message highlights the ""unique value"" and ""significant return on investment"" to justify the high price.
* **Exclusivity:** Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of urgency and desirability. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or even reject your initial offer. You'll need to decide if you're willing to negotiate lower or stick to your guaranteed sale with John.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Active listening, understanding Bob's perspective, and finding areas of compromise (if needed) are crucial for a successful negotiation."
