Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While your minimum acceptable price is $12,000, starting higher allows room for negotiation and the potential to earn more than your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** $13,500 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but not so high as to be immediately dismissed as unreasonable.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message indicates willingness to discuss the price, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging and potentially revealing his own budget limitations.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning you'll list the product publicly, you subtly imply that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act relatively quickly. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between a firm initial offer and a willingness to negotiate, maximizing your chances of securing a higher sale price from Bob."
