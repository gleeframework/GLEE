Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Fairness argument:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to try and influence Bob's perception. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $850,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, it's closer than the first round. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  This is an opportunity to see if we can reach a middle ground. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for less than $1,000,000 just yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's effort:** I'm acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate to build rapport and maintain a positive tone.
* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000,  but staying above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Highlight mutual benefits:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""great deal"" for both of us to make it more appealing.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage further dialogue and see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $950,000? I believe this price is fair and would allow us to both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, $950,000 is still below my target of $1,000,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  We're in round 4, and I have a good chance of getting a better deal with a few more rounds. There's still time to try and convince Bob to reach a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $1,000,000. This price allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
