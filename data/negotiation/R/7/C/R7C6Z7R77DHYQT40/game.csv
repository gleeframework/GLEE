"Alice, $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $850,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $950,000? I believe this price is fair and would allow us to both walk away happy.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $1,000,000. This price allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
