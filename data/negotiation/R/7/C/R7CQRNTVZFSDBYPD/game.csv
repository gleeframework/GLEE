"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000?  I'm confident this is still a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $700,000. Let's try this â€“ how about $825,000? That's me meeting you closer to the middle ground.",825000.0,Bob,4,
