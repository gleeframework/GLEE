Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with its value to me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, and we're now at $1,500,000.  This is a significant profit above my minimum. It's always possible to get more, but continuing the negotiation has risks. Accepting this offer guarantees a good outcome."
