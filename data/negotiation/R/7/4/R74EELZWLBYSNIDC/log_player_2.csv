"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. It's still significantly higher than his desired price. There's room for negotiation, and he has 9 more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't justify paying more than $1,000,000 at this point.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, and he's only had three rounds so far.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to counter-offer gives him a better chance of achieving his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,050,000? This would be a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's ideal price, and he has already rejected two offers in a row.  There's a good chance that if he rejects this offer, Alice will become more stubborn, and he may end up having to buy from John.  Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids further negotiation."
