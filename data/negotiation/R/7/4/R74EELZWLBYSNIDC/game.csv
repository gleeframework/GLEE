"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't justify paying more than $1,000,000 at this point.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,050,000? This would be a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.
