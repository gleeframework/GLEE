"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my minimum price. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else.",11000.0,Alice,5,
