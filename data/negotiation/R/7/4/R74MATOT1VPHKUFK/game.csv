"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $1550000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think.",1550000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1550000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1650000.  This price is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  What do you say?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $1650000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1600000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and where we're both coming from.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
