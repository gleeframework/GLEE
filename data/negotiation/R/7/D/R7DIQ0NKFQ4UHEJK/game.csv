"Alice, I appreciate you reaching out and I'm interested in the product. However, $2,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for it. Let me know if you're open to this price.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be comfortable with.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,850,000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us. I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,825,000, which is a solid price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and make this happen.",1825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,825,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let me think for a moment... Okay, I'm willing to go as low as $1,825,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a dedicated support package. That's my final offer.",1825000.0,Alice,7,
