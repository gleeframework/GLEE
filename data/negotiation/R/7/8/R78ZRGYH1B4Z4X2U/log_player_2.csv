Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the realm of possibility if she's motivated to sell. We'll see how she responds."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
