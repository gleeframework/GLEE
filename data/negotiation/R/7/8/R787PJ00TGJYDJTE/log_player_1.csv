{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 135}

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below your minimum. This allows for some negotiation room while still maximizing your potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $120. Would you be willing to consider $125 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to $135."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $130?  This would still be a great deal for you, and we can finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 130}
