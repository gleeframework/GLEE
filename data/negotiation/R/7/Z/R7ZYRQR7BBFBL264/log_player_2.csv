"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Bob starts with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This signals his willingness to negotiate and sets the stage for potential back-and-forth.
* **Reasoning:** Bob justifies the lower offer by mentioning his budget constraints. This makes the counteroffer seem more reasonable. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  The offer is not too low that it's likely to be immediately rejected, but it still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's closer than her initial offer, it's still not a good deal for Bob.  He's willing to pay $8,000, but not more, so it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $8,000.  This is my final offer as it's my budget limit."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob is signaling that $8,000 is his absolute limit. This creates pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Meet in the Middle:**  Bob emphasizes the ""middle ground"" to make the offer seem fair and reasonable.
* **Budget Limit:** Bob reinforces his budget constraints to discourage further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is your budget limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer it to you for $8200. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,200 is still above Bob's budget limit of $8,000.  While it's a small difference, Bob is committed to staying within his budget and not overpaying.  He's also aware that he has a guaranteed alternative with John at $8,000.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
