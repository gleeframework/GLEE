"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you've outlined, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it, and it allows us both to reach an agreeable outcome."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product truly holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is now offering it for $10,500. This represents a significant savings compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially going back to $11,000 or even higher is present. 
* **Compromise:**  Alice's offer is a fair compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his previous offer. Accepting avoids the risk of further negotiation and secures a good deal."
