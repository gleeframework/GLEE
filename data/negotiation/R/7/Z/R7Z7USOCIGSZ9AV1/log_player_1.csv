Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you've outlined, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it, and it allows us both to reach an agreeable outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product truly holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
