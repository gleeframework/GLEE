"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 140} 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly lower than what I know Bob values the product at. This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing me to get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a better deal."
