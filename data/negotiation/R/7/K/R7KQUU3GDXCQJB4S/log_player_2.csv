"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, Bob has 10 rounds to try and negotiate a lower price. It's worth exploring if he can get closer to his ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets the stage for negotiation and shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  He's aiming for a price that's still more than Alice's value for the product but significantly lower than what he's willing to pay from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I can't go as low as $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above what Bob is comfortable paying.  He's already made a counteroffer and knows Alice is willing to negotiate. He has more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're not willing to go as low as $8,500, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again making a counteroffer, this time increasing his offer slightly from $8,500 to $8,750.  This shows he's willing to negotiate and move closer to Alice's price, but is still holding firm on his desire to save money. By suggesting ""finding a middle ground,"" he's inviting Alice to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,875? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,875 is very close to Bob's ideal price point. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject and he could end up paying more in the next round or having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids further potential risk."
