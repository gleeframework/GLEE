"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something incredibly valuable.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,000,000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, and I am serious about buying it.  How about we settle at $900,000? That's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further, but $1,050,000 is my final offer.  This is a good price for both of us and allows me to meet my minimum requirement. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's get this deal done.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're keen to get this deal done, but I'm still not quite there.  $950,000 is closer, but I need to get at least $1,000,000.  Let's split the difference at $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.",975000.0,Alice,7,
