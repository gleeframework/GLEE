"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering my minimum acceptable price is $8,000.  It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not yet ready to sell at that price. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation while ensuring I don't lose out on too much profit. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for Bob and lead us to a successful deal."
