"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. My starting price is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Enthusiastic tone:** A friendly and enthusiastic message can help build rapport and make Bob more open to negotiating. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price of $15,000, but I'm leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer and keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's a step up from his initial valuation, $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I have 8 more rounds to potentially reach a better deal.  I believe I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer and seeing how Bob responds. 
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John at $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome.  However, I'm not yet willing to give up on potentially getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal happen. This is a fantastic product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it!  Let's find a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show commitment, but remain firm:**  My counteroffer shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in to his low offer.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly to keep Bob engaged and open to reaching an agreement. 
* **Leave room for compromise:**  $11,000 is still a significant profit for me, but it's a step down from my previous offer, signaling a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, it's not enough yet.
* **More rounds available:** I have 6 more rounds to potentially reach a better deal.  I don't want to give up on getting closer to my target price.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** While selling to John is a safe option, I'm still hopeful that I can get a higher price from Bob with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of Bob's last offer ($10,000) and my previous offer ($11,000). This shows a strong willingness to compromise.
* **Positive and confident:** I'm using positive language and expressing confidence in the product's value to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Limited time:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to start closing the deal.  A slight concession might be necessary to avoid risking a sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Considering my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is stuck at $10,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  We've reached a stalemate, and further negotiation seems unlikely to lead to a higher price.
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal increases.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This is a safe and reliable option.

While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, the risk of not closing a deal with him is too high.  Selling to John is the most sensible decision at this point."
