"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  It's a fair price considering the product is worth $12,000 to me and it would be a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $13,000. I understand that it's a fair price to you, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's the most I can afford. Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $14,000, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",15500.0,Alice,5,
