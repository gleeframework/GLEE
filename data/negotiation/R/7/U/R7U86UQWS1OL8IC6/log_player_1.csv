Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum value of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  You're stating your price upfront, encouraging Bob to respond. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your target. You can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's a good price for both of us, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to compromise.
* **Maintains a higher price:** It's still above your minimum and closer to your desired price.
* **Reiterates the value of the product:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth can help him justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$92 is very close to your desired price point, and it's still a good deal for both of you. Accepting Bob's offer allows you to secure a sale without risking a further drop in price or losing the sale to John."
