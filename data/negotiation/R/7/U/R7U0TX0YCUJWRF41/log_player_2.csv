"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than buying from John, it's still a significant amount. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I believe this product holds even greater value for your business. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. I feel this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still more than Bob wants to pay. Bob is willing to pay $850,000, and there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price by counter-offering again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to see a bit more movement on the price to make this deal worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000, but that's my final offer. It's a significant discount and a fair deal considering the value you'll gain.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:** Alice's offer of $890,000 is only $40,000 more than Bob's last counter-offer of $850,000. 
* **It's still a better deal than buying from John:** Buying from Alice for $890,000 saves Bob $110,000 compared to buying from John for $1,000,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept another counteroffer, and Bob might end up paying more if he rejects this offer and tries to negotiate further.

While a lower price is always desirable, accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of potentially paying more or failing to reach an agreement."
