"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 130} 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($120). This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, but also sets a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll reject and counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is still a bit higher than what Bob offered, but it's closer to my desired price point and hopefully, he'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $115 isn't my ideal price, it's getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, and I don't want to risk losing out on the deal with Bob entirely.  I'll accept his offer."
