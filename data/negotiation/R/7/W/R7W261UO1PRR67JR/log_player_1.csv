Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I see the value of this product, $600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm prepared to offer $500,000 for the product. This reflects my current assessment of its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $550,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get it for a little less. I'm willing to offer $525,000. This is a good compromise that shows I'm serious about making a deal, but also reflects the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.
