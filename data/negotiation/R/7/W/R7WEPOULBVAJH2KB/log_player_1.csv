Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, but also ensures I'm maximizing my potential profit.  I'll be prepared to drop the price if necessary, but only to a point where I'm still making a decent profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on his willingness to pay and my own minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not satisfied with the profit margin.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if there's room for further negotiation before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a smaller decrease than Bob's counteroffer, signaling that I'm still quite confident in the value of the product. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is too low for me. I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss in profit. While I prefer selling to Bob, I'm not going to risk losing out on the opportunity to sell to John for $1,000,000.  It's a guaranteed sale, and while it's not my ideal price, it's better than risking further negotiations that could result in a lower offer from Bob or no sale at all."
