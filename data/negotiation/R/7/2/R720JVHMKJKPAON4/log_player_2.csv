"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $1,750,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still over my limit. I can likely negotiate a lower price, but I'm also hesitant to spend too much time negotiating.  I'll counter with a lower price, but I'll be prepared to go with John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the time we've already spent negotiating.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,400,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my limit, but it's still not ideal.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a lower price.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me and the time we've invested in this negotiation.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
