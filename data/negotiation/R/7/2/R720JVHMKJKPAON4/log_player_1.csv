Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $1,750,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me. Bob's offer is too low. I will try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the time we've already spent negotiating.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,500,000. Bob's offer is still too low. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,400,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me and the time we've invested in this negotiation.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm running out of time. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially get a lower price."
