"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product!  I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  I'm starting with an offer of $1,300,000.  Let's discuss!",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. My budget is quite tight, so I would like to propose a lower price of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking to receive for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the value this product represents. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure a fair return on my investment. Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000. This offers a substantial discount from my initial offer while still allowing me to achieve my target price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $1,150,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel there might be room for further discussion. Could we agree on $1,100,000? This would allow us to move forward while respecting both our interests.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your continued engagement in this negotiation. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still unable to go that low.  Perhaps we can find a compromise at $1,125,000? This would represent a significant gain for you compared to your previous offer while ensuring I receive a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's explore this option together.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your patience, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest offer and am willing to move forward at $1,110,000.
