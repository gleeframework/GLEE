"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,750?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $11,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,750, which would be $11,125. Can we consider that?",11125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a good compromise.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $11,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,250, but no higher. Can we meet at this price?",11250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer you the product for $11,400.  This is my absolute lowest, and I'm not going any lower.  If you're not interested, I'm going to have to go with another buyer.",11400.0,Alice,7,
