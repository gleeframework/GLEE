{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking $14,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is a good starting point considering Bob values the product at $15,000. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Friendly tone:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the conversation. 

**Next steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects, I'll consider offering a slightly lower price, but I won't go below $12,000, as that's my minimum acceptable price. If the negotiation stalls, I'll switch to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not good enough.**  While $12,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point and leaves less room for negotiation in the future.
* **The goal is to maximize profit.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round.
* **Potential for better outcome:** Bob has already shown interest and is willing to negotiate. I believe there's potential to reach a price closer to my initial asking price with further negotiation.

**Next steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $14,000. I'll be prepared to adjust the price further if needed, but I won't drop below $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a great deal for both of us, and it gives me some room to be flexible.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer in the middle:**  I'm proposing $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. This shows a willingness to compromise and keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Positive and persuasive message:** The message is upbeat and focuses on the benefits of the deal for both of us. It emphasizes the value of the product and encourages Bob to accept the offer.
* **Maintaining flexibility:**  While $13,500 is my preferred price, I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed, but I won't go below $13,000.

**Next steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and be ready to make further concessions if necessary. However, I'll also be firm in my stance and not settle for a price significantly lower than my goal. If the negotiation stalls, I'll still have the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us and it would make the deal more attractive to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is within my acceptable range.**  $13,000 is only $500 less than my last offer and is still significantly higher than selling to John for $12,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant gains.**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but it's likely he won't go higher than $13,000.  
* **Time is a factor.**  Continuing to negotiate could take longer and might result in the deal falling through altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit.

**Next steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This is a good outcome for me, as I've secured a price that's both profitable and allows me to avoid further negotiations and potential delays."
