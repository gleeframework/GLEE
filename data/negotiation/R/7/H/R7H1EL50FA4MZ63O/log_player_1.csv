Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $115 is higher than $100, but still within a range where Bob might be willing to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $115 is less than your minimum of $120, leaving room for potential concessions. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is friendly and straightforward, clearly stating the price. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go as low as $105. How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:** $110 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Stay above my minimum:** $110 is still higher than my minimum, but leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $108? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $108 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my acceptable price.  I've already gone through a couple of rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Bob isn't willing to budge much further. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $120.  This will guarantee me my minimum profit and save me from potentially getting stuck in a long and unproductive negotiation."
