"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $10,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.
* **Risk:**  Rejecting the offer allows for potential lower price, but also the risk of Alice walking away or counteroffering too high. 
* **Strategy:**  Start by rejecting and seeing if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  A significant counteroffer ($2,000 less) shows a serious intent to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $8,000 is still a reasonable price, leaving room for negotiation without being immediately rejected.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to lower her price and her negotiating stance."
