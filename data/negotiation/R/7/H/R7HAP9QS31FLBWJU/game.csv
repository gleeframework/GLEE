"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I believe it's worth every penny. However, I'm willing to start with a price that's slightly below the market value to get the ball rolling. I'm offering it to you for $750000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm prepared to offer $700000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $700000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to counteroffer at $725000. This is my best and final offer for now. Let me know if you're interested.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. However, $725000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $710000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal. What do you think?",710000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm going to counteroffer at $720000. This is a fair price that should meet both of our needs. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",720000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $710000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get what we want out of this deal.  Let's reach an agreement and finalize this sale.",710000.0,Bob,6,
