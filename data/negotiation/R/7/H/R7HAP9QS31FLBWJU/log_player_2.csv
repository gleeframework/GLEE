"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I believe it's worth every penny. However, I'm willing to start with a price that's slightly below the market value to get the ball rolling. I'm offering it to you for $750000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $700000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to counteroffer at $725000. This is my best and final offer for now. Let me know if you're interested.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm going to counteroffer at $720000. This is a fair price that should meet both of our needs. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.
