"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $950,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $980,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, I still need to be closer to $1 million to make this work. How about $1,020,000? That's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.  I'm not sure I can go any lower.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you need to be closer to $1 million, but I'm not comfortable going above $990,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",990000.0,Bob,6,
