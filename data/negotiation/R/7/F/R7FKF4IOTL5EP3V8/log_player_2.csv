"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$180 is way above your budget. You want to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

You're willing to pay the absolute maximum of $100, so you're going to start by offering that and see if Alice is willing to go that low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $160 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You want to try to negotiate a lower price.  You're also running out of rounds and could risk having to pay the $100 to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

You're going to offer $120, which is halfway between your initial offer and Alice's current offer.  This shows that you're willing to compromise, and it might be more appealing to Alice than your previous offer. You're also getting closer to the number of rounds where you'd have to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. You need to keep pushing for a lower price, and you're running out of rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

You're offering $130, which is a compromise between your last offer and Alice's current offer.  With only 4 rounds left, you need to push for a deal but also avoid getting stuck with John's higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  You're down to the last three rounds, and you still want to get the best possible price.  You need to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

You're offering $140, which is a little closer to Alice's offer but still below what you're willing to pay.  You're trying to see if you can reach a compromise with only two rounds left, and it's getting risky to wait much longer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $172. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $172
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's getting very close to the end of negotiations, and Alice is not budging on her price. With only one round left, it's too risky to keep negotiating.  You'll have to buy from John and pay $100."
