"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you're providing. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product and my financial situation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial situation, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves you a significant profit margin. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
