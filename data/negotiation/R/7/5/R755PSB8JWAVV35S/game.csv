"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my target range and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. My revised offer is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in your product. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. My revised offer is $975,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer $925,000 for the product. This is a substantial increase from my last offer and reflects the value I see in your product. I'm hopeful we can reach a final agreement that benefits both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $925,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. My revised offer is $950,000, which is the same as my previous offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",950000.0,Alice,7,
