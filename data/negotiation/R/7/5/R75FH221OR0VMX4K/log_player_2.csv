"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really like it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's not worth buying from Alice at $150, as you can get it from John for $120. It makes more sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than what you're willing to pay from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit steep. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob. However, I still think $125 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need $135 to make it worth my while. Can we meet at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $135 is still higher than what you're willing to pay from John.  Since you can get the product for $120 from John, it's best to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John."
