"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $13,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000, which is $12,250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12250.0,Alice,5,
