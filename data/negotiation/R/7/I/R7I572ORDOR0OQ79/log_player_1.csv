"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good starting point. It's unlikely Bob will accept this, but it sets a strong initial position and gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming higher. I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm lowering my price, but not too much. I'm still above Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product highly."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating. There are still rounds remaining and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers haven't reached my desired price point. While I'm still hopeful for a good deal, I'm not confident I can close with him at a price that satisfies my minimum.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
