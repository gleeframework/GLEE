"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a good starting point, but there's room to negotiate. Alice is still quite a bit above your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to move upwards if needed.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses interest while also being clear that the initial offer is too high. 
* **Targeting a Good Deal:** Aiming for $9,000 gives you a significant saving and leaves space for potential compromise with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** Alice is getting closer to your limit, but you can still try to push for a better deal. Since you have John as a backup at $10,000, there's no need to settle just yet. 

Let's see if Alice is willing to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 10250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($10,500) and your previous offer ($10,000). However, it leans slightly in your favor.
* **Final Offer:** Stating this is your final offer adds a bit of pressure and signals to Alice that you're serious about this price.
* **Staying Above John:**  This offer still keeps you below John's $10,000 price, giving you a little wiggle room."
