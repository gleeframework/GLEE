Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised on the price by offering $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My next offer is $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about acquiring this product, but also reflects my financial limitations. Let's find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise, while still pushing for a lower price.  Offering $875,000 keeps the negotiation moving, and hopefully, Alice will be more willing to accept a price closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. My next offer is $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is still above my budget.  While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, it's clear that she's not willing to go much lower. With only three rounds left, I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach a deal that satisfies both of us. 

Therefore, I'm choosing to buy the product from John for $800,000. It's the safest option, as I know I can get the product for a price that meets my needs."
