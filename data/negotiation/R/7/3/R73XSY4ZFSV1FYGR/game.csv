"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,800,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
