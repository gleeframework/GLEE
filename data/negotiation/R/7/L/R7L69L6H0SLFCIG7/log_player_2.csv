Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,250 is close, but I think I can only justify $9,750.  Do you think we can make this work?"",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,100. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting very granular.  While I could try to push for a slightly better price, accepting at $10,100 feels like a good outcome at this point. It avoids the risk of Alice increasing her price again or the deal falling through."
