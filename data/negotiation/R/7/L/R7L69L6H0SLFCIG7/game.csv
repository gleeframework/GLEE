"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,250 is close, but I think I can only justify $9,750.  Do you think we can make this work?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,100. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me.",10100.0,Alice,7,
