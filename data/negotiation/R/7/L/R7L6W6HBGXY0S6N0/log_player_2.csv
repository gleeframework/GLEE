"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This unique item is worth $1,200,000 to me, reflecting its exceptional quality and rarity. Given its significance to you, it's estimated to be worth $800,000 to you. Considering the mutual benefits and the importance of this product to both parties, I am proposing to sell it to you at a special price of $950,000. This offer allows you to secure a high-quality asset at a premium but still below its perceived value to you, while ensuring a fair return for me. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you wish to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
