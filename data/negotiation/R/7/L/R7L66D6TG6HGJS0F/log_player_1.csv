{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also opens the door for a friendly dialogue with Bob, potentially leading to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider $8000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately I can't go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,500? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 8500}
