{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This will hopefully encourage her to come down in price.  I'm aiming to get as close to my target of $800,000 as possible, but I'm willing to be flexible to secure the deal."

Alice is still a bit high, but I think we can get closer to my target price.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, but still well below Alice's last offer.  I'm hoping this will show her that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm not willing to go above my limit."

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but she's getting closer to my target price. I'm going to reject her offer and see if I can get her to drop even further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to make my final offer at my target price of $800,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it.  If she doesn't, I'll go with John's offer."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my target price, and we only have a few rounds left. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal.  I'm going to buy the product from John at my target price of $800,000."
