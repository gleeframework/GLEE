Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll see if I can push for a little more in a counteroffer."
