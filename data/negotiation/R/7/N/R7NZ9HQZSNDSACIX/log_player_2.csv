"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both room to negotiate. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is above your maximum price. It makes sense to negotiate rather than accepting this price or buying from John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from a starting point significantly below your target price. This leaves room for you to gradually increase your offer while gauging Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses continued interest in the product while making it clear that the initial offer was not acceptable. 
* **Target in Mind:** Remember, you want to stay well below your $800,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is just too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $775,000. That still gives you a good deal, and I can live with that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, $775,000 is still above your target price.
* **John as Backup:** You have the option to buy from John at $800,000, so there's no need to rush into accepting a price higher than that. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By rejecting this offer, you can make another counteroffer, aiming to meet somewhere between $775,000 and your $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's latest offer ($775,000) and your previous offer ($700,000). 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By slightly increasing your offer, you signal to Alice that you are serious about the purchase but also holding firm to your budget.
* **Below Limit:** It's important to stay below your $800,000 maximum, leaving a buffer in case Alice counters again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $760,000?  It's a compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $760,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $760,000 is only $40,000 less than your fallback option of buying from John. It's a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly lower price, but there's also a chance Alice could walk away, forcing you to buy from John at full price.
* **Good Deal:**  You've successfully negotiated a price below your maximum and likely got a better deal than simply accepting Alice's first offer."
