"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is just too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $775,000. That still gives you a good deal, and I can live with that price.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $760,000?  It's a compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good deal.",760000.0,Alice,5,
