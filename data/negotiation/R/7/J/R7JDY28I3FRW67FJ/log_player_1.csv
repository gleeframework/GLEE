Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, leaving room for negotiation but still significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Appeal to Bob's value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to motivate him to accept a higher price. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This offer provides space for Bob to counter without immediately pushing him to John.

**Strategy:** 

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I hope to maximize my profits while still keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll be prepared to counter with a slightly lower price, but still aiming to achieve a price closer to $15,000. I'll also be mindful of the time spent negotiating and be ready to accept John's offer if the negotiation drags on or if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
