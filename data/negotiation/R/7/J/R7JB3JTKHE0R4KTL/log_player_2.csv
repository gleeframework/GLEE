The product is worth $1,400,000 to Alice, and you are willing to pay a maximum of $800,000.  There is a significant gap, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

I'm offering Alice my maximum price, $800,000.  This is a significant drop from her initial offer, but it's the most I'm willing to pay. Hopefully, she'll see the value in closing the deal and accept."

Alice is still way above my maximum price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but if she doesn't get closer to my price, I'll just buy from John."

I'm increasing my offer by $100,000 to $900,000. This is still a significant discount from Alice's offer, but I'm hoping it shows her that I'm serious about buying the product."

I'm offering Alice $950,000, which is halfway between my last offer and her last offer.  This is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince her to accept.  If she rejects this offer, I'll just buy from John."
