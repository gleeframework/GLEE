"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $8,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,750 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't regret.  What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $8,250 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $8,000 even? I think that's a fair compromise.",8000.0,Bob,6,
