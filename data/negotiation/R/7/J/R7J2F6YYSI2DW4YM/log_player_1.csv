Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000,  but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, so I'm starting high to see if he's willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for $8,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $15,000. This is still a decent profit for me, and I'm hoping it's a more appealing price for Bob.  It's also a significant increase from his $8,000 offer, indicating a willingness to compromise.  I'm optimistic that we can reach a deal somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth, and I'd rather see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price in between his offer and my last one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $13,000. This is still a good profit margin for me and it shows I'm willing to compromise. It's likely that Bob will either accept this offer or make a final counteroffer that I can accept.  If he rejects, I'll move on to John and sell for $12,000, which is still a decent outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer, but it's still not quite enough to meet my minimum acceptable price. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $12,000, it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'll sell to John and avoid any further risk of a lower offer from Bob."
