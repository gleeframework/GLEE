"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant value for you, as you've indicated its worth to you is $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price, allowing both of us to benefit from the transaction. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $800,000.  I hope you'll consider this offer. ",1000000.0,Alice,1,
