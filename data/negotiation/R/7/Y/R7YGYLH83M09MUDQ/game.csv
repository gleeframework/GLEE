"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your initial interest.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $19,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. To be fair, I can't go as low as $12,000. My bottom line is $16,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my strong desire to find a solution that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap.  I could go up to $13,000, but that's really my limit.",13000.0,Bob,6,
