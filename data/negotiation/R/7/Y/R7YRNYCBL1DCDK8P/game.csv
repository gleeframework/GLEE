"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be even more valuable to you.  My starting price is $1,150,000.  Let's discuss this further.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can get out of it.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000,  which I believe is a fair compromise given the value you'll gain. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  I'm confident this product will generate more than that value for you.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,090,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm thinking of $1,085,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1085000.0,Bob,6,
