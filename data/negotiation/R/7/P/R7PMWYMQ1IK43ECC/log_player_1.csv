Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and even higher than our minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows us to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" and not disclosing our minimum, we create the impression that the price is justified.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" introduces a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** We end with ""What do you think?"" to appear open to negotiation and gauge Bob's interest.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, we can adjust our approach in further interactions. Our safety net is John's offer, ensuring we won't sell below our minimum."
