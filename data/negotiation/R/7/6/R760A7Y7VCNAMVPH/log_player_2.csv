You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than her initial asking price, you can likely get a better deal. You can counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit below where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your desired price, you can still potentially get a better deal. Continue negotiating with Alice, aiming for a price closer to $12,500."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,250. This price is reasonable, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,250 is closer, but I'm still a little away from my target. Would you be open to $13,500? That's a fair compromise that would allow me to accept your offer. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

You should accept Alice's offer.  While you'd prefer to pay closer to $12,500, $13,500 is still a better price than John's $12,000. Further negotiation might not be worth the effort considering the relatively small difference."
