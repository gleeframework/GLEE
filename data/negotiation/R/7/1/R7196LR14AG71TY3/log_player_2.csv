"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since he has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. He's aiming for a price closer to his own valuation of $1,000,000. This establishes a clear negotiation point and signals his willingness to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's goal, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay from John. With more rounds available, Bob can continue to negotiate for a better price.  He can try to push for a price closer to his desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now increasing the pressure on Alice by offering a price that is closer to John's offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This shows Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal and is willing to walk away if she doesn't come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still close to his target price of $1,000,000. It's risky to accept Alice's offer, as he has 5 more rounds to negotiate and the option to buy from John for $1,000,000. 

He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1030000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a counteroffer that is very close to Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise. This approach might encourage Alice to make a final concession in the next round to close the deal.  There is still some room for negotiation as Alice is likely motivated to make a deal to avoid losing a sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to Bob's target price, it's still not ideal. Bob has three more rounds to negotiate and still has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000.  There's a strong chance he can still get a better deal with Alice, or, if he fails, he can secure the product at his target price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1010000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a final push to secure a deal with Alice at a price very close to his target. He is showing a strong commitment to a deal but still has the safety net of John's offer. This counteroffer leaves very little room for Alice to counter and incentivizes her to accept the deal to avoid losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiation with Alice.  While Alice's offer is only $50,000 higher than Bob's target price, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept Bob's counteroffer in the next round.  Therefore, to avoid the risk of a failed deal, Bob should take the guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000 to secure the product at his desired price."
