Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our ongoing conversation, $1000000 is still a bit below my target price.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

While Alice has come down in price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You're still saving money compared to buying from John, so there's room to push for a better deal."
