"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's above your maximum budget, and there's room for negotiation.  You want to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $1,050,000.  This represents a reasonable compromise, reflecting the value while still offering you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to your ideal price range, you're still above your desired purchase price. You're still saving money by negotiating with Alice instead of buying from John, but you have room to push for a lower price.  You have plenty of rounds left to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me.  To make this deal work, I'd like to propose a price of $1,000,000.  This offer reflects the potential of the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
