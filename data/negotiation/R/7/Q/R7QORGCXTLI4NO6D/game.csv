"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which would give you a decent profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
