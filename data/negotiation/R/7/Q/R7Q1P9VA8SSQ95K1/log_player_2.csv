"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget.  You should reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price.  You have 10 rounds to make a deal, so there's time to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is way out of my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500.  This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a more realistic offer. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $13,000 is still above your maximum budget.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still quite large.  I have other interested buyers, and to be frank, $12,000 is the lowest I can go at this point.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal given the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is still above your budget. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the deal could fall apart, and you'd end up with nothing.  Since John is willing to sell the product for your maximum budget, it's the safest and most sensible option to buy from him.  You're guaranteed to get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
