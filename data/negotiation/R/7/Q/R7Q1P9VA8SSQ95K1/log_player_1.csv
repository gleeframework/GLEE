"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price to give yourself room to maneuver.
* **Gauge Bob's reaction:** This initial high price will help you understand how eager Bob is to purchase and his potential price ceiling. 
* **Alternative buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup at $12,000 gives you leverage and a strong bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is way out of my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500.  This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob increased his offer slightly, $8,500 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's a substantial gap between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, indicating room for negotiation.
* **Backup option:** You still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, allowing you to negotiate confidently with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a more realistic offer. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant reduction, but above the minimum:** This counteroffer shows flexibility on your part while still staying well above your $12,000 minimum and leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Justified price:**  Emphasizing the ""true value"" reinforces the idea that your price is based on more than just arbitrary negotiation. 
* **Meeting in the middle:**  Proposing a compromise encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly below your $12,000 minimum.
* **Slow progress:**  While Bob is moving in the right direction, his increases are incremental. You need to incentivize him to offer a more substantial amount.
* **Time constraint:**  We are four rounds in, and the gap is still wide.  It's time to leverage your alternative buyer more strongly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still quite large.  I have other interested buyers, and to be frank, $12,000 is the lowest I can go at this point.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal given the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** It's time to signal that you're serious about your bottom line. By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency.
* **Transparency and justification:** Being transparent about having other buyers and setting a firm limit at your minimum ($12,000) reinforces your position. 
* **Giving Bob a choice:**  You're leaving the decision in Bob's hands. He can choose to meet your price or risk losing the deal altogether."
