"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is way out of my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500.  This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a more realistic offer. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still quite large.  I have other interested buyers, and to be frank, $12,000 is the lowest I can go at this point.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal given the value you'll receive.",12000.0,Alice,5,
