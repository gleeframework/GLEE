Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,050,000 at this time. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Bob's offer is still too low. It's better to try to negotiate a higher price than to settle for less than I'm comfortable with. I will counter-offer to bridge the gap."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. To reach a deal, I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's find common ground and close this deal.

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to settle yet.  I will counteroffer to try and secure a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,075,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not comfortable accepting that price.

This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
