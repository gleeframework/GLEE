# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity.  I believe this product will be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential. My starting price is $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial deal, but this is a fair starting point given the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Alice's offer is too high. It's still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,050,000 at this time. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still too high for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. To reach a deal, I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,075,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not comfortable accepting that price.  To find common ground, I'm willing to lower my price slightly to $1,090,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, $1,090,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating for a better price. I believe there's still room to find a mutually agreeable solution before I need to consider buying from John."
