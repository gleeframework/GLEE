"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:** $110, which is above Bob's maximum price of $120. 
* **Strategy:** It's best to reject the initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds to go, and Bob has the option to buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $95? It's a good price for both of us, and we can get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible, ideally getting closer to Alice's minimum.
* **Alice's offer:** $110 is too high.
* **Counteroffer:** $95 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and could potentially lead to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $105 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120.
* **Strategy:** It's still worth rejecting the offer. Bob has the option to buy from John for $120, making Alice's offer unattractive.  It's best to continue negotiating and try to get closer to a price that Bob finds acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $100.  This would give you a good profit and let me get a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Get the price as close to $95 as possible, but still within his budget of $120.
* **Alice's offer:**  $105 is still too high.
* **Counteroffer:**  $100 is a compromise. It's a significant drop from Alice's offer and closer to what Bob wants to pay. This keeps the negotiation moving and puts pressure on Alice to accept or come back with a counteroffer closer to Bob's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is your maximum, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'd like to add a little extra value to the deal. I'll throw in a bonus feature that's worth $10, making the total value of the product $130. Considering the value I'm bringing to the table, I'm willing to sell it to you for $105. It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $105 with a bonus feature worth $10. While the bonus feature adds value, Bob is still paying more than his initial goal of $120.
* **Strategy:** It's still best to reject the offer. The bonus feature may be appealing, but Bob should prioritize staying within his budget. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price without the bonus feature or try to get a better value for the bonus.  There are still 5 rounds remaining, so there's time to explore different options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you adding the bonus feature, but I'm still sticking to my budget. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product, without the bonus.  I'm sure it's a great product even without the extra features, and we can still make a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Get the product for $100 or lower, ideally without the bonus feature.
* **Alice's offer:** $105 with a bonus feature is tempting, but still above Bob's budget and potentially unnecessary.
* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer focuses on the core product value and Bob's commitment to his budget. It removes the bonus feature from the equation, making the price more appealing to Bob.  This could push Alice to either accept the offer or reduce the price further to secure the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell you the product without the bonus feature for $102. It's still a great deal considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to make a small concession to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible, ideally getting the product for $100 or less.
* **Alice's offer:** $102 is a slight improvement from her previous offer, but it's still above Bob's desired price.
* **Strategy:**  It's still worth rejecting the offer. Bob has the option to buy from John for $120, and Alice's offer is not compelling enough to give up that safety net. There are only 3 rounds left, which increases the pressure on Alice to make a more attractive offer.  Bob should continue to try to negotiate a lower price, potentially reaching a compromise in the next round or two."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me. I'm really close to making a decision, but $102 is still a bit out of my range. I can go up to $101, and that would be a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 101}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Get the product as close to $100 as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:**  $102 is still too high, but shows a willingness to negotiate further.
* **Counteroffer:** $101 is a small but significant step toward Bob's desired price. It's a clear sign of commitment to closing the deal.  With only two rounds left, this could push Alice to accept or come back with a counteroffer that's within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell you the product without the bonus feature for $100.50. It's still a good deal for me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible. Ideally, he wants the product for $100 or less.
* **Alice's offer:** $100.50 is very close to Bob's desired price but still above it.
* **Strategy:** While Alice's offer is tempting, Bob has one more round to try to negotiate a lower price. It's possible Alice might be willing to drop the price further to avoid going to John.  There's still a chance to get a better deal, especially considering that Alice has been consistently negotiating down from her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $100.50 is still a little more than I can afford right now.  I'm ready to close this deal, but I can only go up to $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great deal for me.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Get the product for $100 or less.
* **Alice's offer:** $100.50 is very close, but Bob wants to try one last time to get the exact price he desires.
* **Counteroffer:**  $100 is a final offer, demonstrating Bob's commitment to the deal while staying within his budget. It's a bold move, but with only one round left, Bob has nothing to lose. If Alice rejects, he can go to John for a higher price."
