"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business. Based on its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This allows for a significant return on your investment, while also ensuring I receive fair value for my product.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my business and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value this product holds.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This would ensure both of us are satisfied with the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $925,000 is my absolute limit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider this price?",925000.0,Bob,4,
