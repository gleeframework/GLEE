Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and still being attractive to Bob. 

Here's why:

* **It's a good deal for Bob:**  He gets the product for $1,200,000 less than it's worth to him. This makes the deal very appealing.
* **It's a good deal for me:** I earn $200,000 more than my minimum acceptable price, and it's still likely that Bob will accept.

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll still make a profit by selling to John, but I'll be giving up the potential for a larger gain."
