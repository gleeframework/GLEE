"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1500000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is higher than her product's worth to her ($1,200,000), it's still lower than what you'd pay John ($1,500,000).  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000."
