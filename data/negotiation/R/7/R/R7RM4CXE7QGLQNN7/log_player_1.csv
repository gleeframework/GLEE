Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. This offer is time-sensitive, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting at $12,000 gives you a buffer.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" might incentivize Bob to act quickly.
* **Highlight Value (without specifics):**  Instead of detailing why the product is worth $12,000, keep the focus on its potential benefit to Bob. This leaves room for him to justify the price based on his own perceived value.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to find the highest price he's willing to pay above your minimum of $10,000."
