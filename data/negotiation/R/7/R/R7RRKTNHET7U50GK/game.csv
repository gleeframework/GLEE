"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd need to start with an offer of $850,000. This is my best price point, and I believe it's fair considering the value we both see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let's try $875,000. This is a firm offer, but I'm committed to making this deal work.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I can do $885000, which is a bit closer to your offer. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the concessions I've made so far.",885000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for coming down to $885,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm getting closer to my target price, I need to stay within my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm going to make a final offer of $870,000. This is my absolute best price, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",870000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I can do $880000, which is a bit higher than your latest offer. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. However, I want to make it clear that this is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",880000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, $880,000 is still a little outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  I'm confident we can finalize this purchase with this price.",875000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $880000. I'm starting to consider other options, and I'd like to give you one last chance to meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to explore other opportunities. This is my final offer.",880000.0,Alice,9,
