"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth $8000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,500 is a good deal, there's potential to negotiate further and get an even lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to do $7,000?  That would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get closer to your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $7250, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Saving Money:** $7,250 is still a good deal for Bob, as he's saving $750 compared to buying from John.
* **Compromise:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, meeting Bob halfway between their initial offer and his counteroffer.
* **Limited Rounds:**  Accepting the offer keeps the negotiation moving and avoids the risk of Alice becoming less flexible in future rounds. There's a chance Bob could get an even lower price, but it's not guaranteed."
