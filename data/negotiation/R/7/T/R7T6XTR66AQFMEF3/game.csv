"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product. While I understand its worth to you is $800,000, I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to sell it for $1,200,000, which is still a significant gain for you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
