"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. I think that's a great compromise.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $8,750.  Let's try to split the difference.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is my original offer, but I'll throw in a small discount of $250, making it $8,750, plus I'll also include a free accessory that's worth $250. That way, you'll still get a great deal, and I'll still get a fair price for the product.",8750.0,Alice,5,
