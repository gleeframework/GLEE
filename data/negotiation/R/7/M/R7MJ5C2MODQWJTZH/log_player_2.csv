"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You can likely get a better price than $9,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. I think that's a great compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

You're still closer to your goal price of $8,000. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get Alice down a bit more."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $8,750.  Let's try to split the difference."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is my original offer, but I'll throw in a small discount of $250, making it $8,750, plus I'll also include a free accessory that's worth $250. That way, you'll still get a great deal, and I'll still get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a good deal for you! You're getting the product for $8,750, which is below your maximum price of $10,000 and a good price considering Alice was willing to sell it for $8,000.  The free accessory is a bonus.  You should accept the offer."
