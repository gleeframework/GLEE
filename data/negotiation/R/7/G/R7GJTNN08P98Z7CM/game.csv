I believe this price reflects the quality and benefits of the product while allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we aim for a price closer to the midpoint between our offers? I suggest $750,000 for the product. This is still above its worth to you but significantly lower than my initial offer. I hope this proposal works for you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. While $750,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
