Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,400,000 is more than your minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $1,400,000 is less than Bob's valuation of $1,500,000, giving him incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space to increase the price if Bob is willing to pay more. 

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, you maximize your chances of getting a good price while still potentially securing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer. There's still room for negotiation, and you can likely get a higher price.  You are confident you can get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet at $1,350,000?  This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer is a good middle ground:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're not desperate and that you value the product.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob's still hesitant, you can potentially lower the price a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $1,300,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for you. It's higher than John's offer of $1,200,000, and it's only $50,000 below your initial offer.  It's a reasonable compromise, and you're likely to get a better price than you would by continuing to negotiate."
