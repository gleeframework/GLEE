Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $7,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's get this done!

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge much more:** She's already come down, but is still holding firm above your absolute limit.
* **You're close to your walk-away price:**  Paying $500 more to potentially save only a small amount isn't worth the risk of the deal falling through.
* **John offers certainty:**  You know you can get the product for $8,000, no haggling required."
