"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $15,000 to me.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $7,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's get this done!",8500.0,Alice,5,
