"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I have a budget constraint and I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I would like to accommodate you as much as possible. I am willing to negotiate the price down to $105. This still allows us to cover our costs and provides a reasonable profit for us. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. Let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this arrangement.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $105. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to make a purchase at that price.",95.0,Bob,4,
