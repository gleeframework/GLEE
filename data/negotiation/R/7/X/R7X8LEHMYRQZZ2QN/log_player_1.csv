Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows Bob values the product, so she starts with a strong offer close to her minimum ($1,200,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $1,100,000 price tag leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, giving Alice the opportunity to meet in the middle.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice is secure knowing she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her minimum acceptable price, so she can afford to be firm in negotiations with Bob."
