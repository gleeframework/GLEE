"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses lower. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position, but given the value and uniqueness of the product, I cannot agree to the price you've suggested. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11000. This price still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while acknowledging your budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still looking to keep my expenses as low as possible. Could we perhaps discuss a price closer to $9500? I believe this would be a more reasonable compromise for both parties involved.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering the high value of the product and the costs associated with production and delivery, I am unable to accept $9500. However, I am willing to consider $10000 as a compromise. This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin, while also being more accommodating to your financial situation. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
