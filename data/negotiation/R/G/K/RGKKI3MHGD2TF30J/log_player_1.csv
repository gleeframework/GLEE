Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think you'd really find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $150 if you could possibly accommodate. This would allow me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is clearly fixated on $150, which is below my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in wasting more rounds when I have a guaranteed offer for $150 from John."
