"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll reject his offer and counter with my own in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is still a good price for me, and I believe it's reasonable enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my target price. I'm willing to accept it and close the deal. While I could potentially get a little more, the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of losing the deal to John makes this offer acceptable."
