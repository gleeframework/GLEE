"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a different idea of the value. While I appreciate your offer, I can't accept $1,200,000. It's below my minimum threshold. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  I believe this price reflects the product's unique qualities and is still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm hoping it's a reasonable compromise. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below John's price. It makes more sense to buy from John for $1,500,000 and avoid further negotiation."
