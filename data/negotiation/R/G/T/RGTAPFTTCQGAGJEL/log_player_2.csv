"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a great value for this unique product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, but closer to it. It's still worth trying to negotiate further. I can likely get it for closer to my target price with another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're close to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11200. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above my budget. While it's tempting to try to negotiate further, the risk of going back and forth with Alice is too high.  It's likely we'll continue to be at an impasse, and I'm already close to my limit.  John's offer is the safest and most secure option, allowing me to stay within my budget and avoid further haggling."
