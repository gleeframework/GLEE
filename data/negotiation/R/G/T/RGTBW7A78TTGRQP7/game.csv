"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price, considering the market value. I'd be willing to make a deal at that price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your perspective on the market value, Bob, but I still believe the product's unique features and benefits warrant a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $850000. I'd be willing to pay $820000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",820000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $820000. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway at $850000, and I'm not comfortable going any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $840000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",840000.0,Alice,5,
