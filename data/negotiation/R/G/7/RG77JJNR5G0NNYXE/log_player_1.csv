I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping it's attractive enough for Bob to consider.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm going to test the waters with this offer and see how he responds.  If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,350,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but still a significant amount above Bob's current offer. I hope this shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly. We'll see if this is enough to get Bob closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,250,000 is still a good deal.  It's only $50,000 less than John's offer, and it avoids the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially losing both deals."
