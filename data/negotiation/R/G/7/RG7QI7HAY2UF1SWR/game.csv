"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're continuing to work together. However, I'm still not convinced that $1325000 is the right price for this product.

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I still believe this product is worth a premium price.

I'm counteroffering at $1375000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support team. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in it.",1375000.0,Alice,9,
