"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",130.0,Bob,2,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $132.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $133.75. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",133.75,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $133.75 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $131.25, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",131.25,Bob,6,
