"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice:**  You'll pay $950,000, which is still within your budget and saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John:**  This would cost you $1,000,000, which is the maximum you're willing to spend. 

It's always better to save money, even if it's a small amount."
