"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate and appear flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $160, you're leaving ample room to go down while still staying above your minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This first offer will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $120 matches your minimum acceptable price, it's still early in the negotiation. There's potential to secure a better deal. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you value the product higher and are willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $120 is a bit low for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Maintaining Value:** By not immediately dropping to your minimum, you maintain the perceived value of the product. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will help gauge how much negotiating room Bob has and how determined he is to purchase the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $140. How about we meet at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested in the product but is demonstrating a firm upper limit to what he's willing to pay. At $130, you're exceeding your minimum acceptable price and securing a profit. It's not guaranteed that further negotiation will result in a better offer from Bob, and waiting carries the risk of him losing interest altogether. Accepting this offer is a good balance of profit and deal security."
