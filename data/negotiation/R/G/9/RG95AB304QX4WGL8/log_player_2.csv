"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is far above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to reject and negotiate a better price. You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to try and get a deal closer to your desired price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value of the product to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my final offer.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for you. It's within your budget, and you've successfully negotiated a lower price from her original asking price.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further, and you might end up having to buy from John at $10,000. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price."
