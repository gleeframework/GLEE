"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $8,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That's a significant jump from my last offer.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,750 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference at $8,125?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",8125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle this right now at $8,000?  That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
