"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, I am unable to meet the asking price of $950000. Considering the product's worth to me is $800000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $875000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking to receive while still allowing me to acquire the product at a fair price.",875000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to maximize my return on investment. Considering the product's worth to you is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my original price. I propose a counteroffer of $912500. This price still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more competitive than my initial offer.",912500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate the effort to find common ground. However, based on my assessment of the product's worth, I am unable to agree to a price higher than $875000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $860000. This price still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping the transaction within my budget.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at a price lower than my original offer of $950000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make one more concession. I propose a final counteroffer of $920000. This price is still a compromise, but it's closer to my original target. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",920000.0,Alice,5,
