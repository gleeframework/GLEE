"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down, Alice, I appreciate that. To be honest though, anything above $100 is just not going to work for me. If you're able to do $100, I'm ready to buy right now.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you at $110. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really like the product.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and do $105? That's the best I can do.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",112.5,Alice,7,

"Alice, you drive a hard bargain! Tell you what, let's make this our final exchange - $108, and we have a deal.",108.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more move. How about we meet at $109? It's getting close to the original price, but I'm willing to give a bit more to get the deal done.",109.0,Alice,9,
