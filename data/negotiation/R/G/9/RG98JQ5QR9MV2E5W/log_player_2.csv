"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $9,500 from Alice.  Since your maximum is $10,000, rejecting the offer and counter-offering gives you a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is within your budget of $10,000 and is better than John's price.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
