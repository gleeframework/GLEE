"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $8,750. I can do $9,200, which is a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can get closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9200.0,Alice,5,
