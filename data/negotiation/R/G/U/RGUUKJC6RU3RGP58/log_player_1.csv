Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product to make my offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a possible win-win scenario.

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open and giving Bob an incentive to engage."
