``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming high at $9,000 knowing that the product is worth that to Bob. I'm also trying to build a friendly rapport with Bob to potentially influence his decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $7,500, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of offering $7000. Would you be willing to meet me at $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $7,500, I'm holding out for a little more. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,000 is too low for me. How about we try $7,750? It's closer to your offer, but still allows me to get a fair price for the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 7750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7000 and $7750, which would be $7375. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,375 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm not ready to give up just yet, and I believe there's still a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. Let's try $7,500. It's a fair compromise that's closer to your budget, but still allows me to get a decent price for the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $7500. I'm willing to go up to $7250. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting dangerously close to my minimum. It's clear that Bob is unwilling to go any higher, and continuing the negotiations is likely to result in even lower offers. 

Selling to John for $8,000 is the best option at this point. It guarantees a fair price for the product and avoids the risk of further price reductions."
