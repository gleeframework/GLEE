Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $10,000 to me, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": 9,500}

Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than the product's value to him. I'll think carefully about my next move...

Since I can get $8,800 from Bob, which is a decent price, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer to try to get closer to my target price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since he was willing to pay $8,800, I'll try to nudge the price up a bit. I'll offer:

{""product_price"": 9,200}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is getting lower and lower! Since the product is worth $10,000 to me, I'm not willing to sell it for $8,500. I'll think carefully about my next move...

Since I can get $10,000 from John, which is my target price, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell the product to John for $10,000, as it's a better deal for me than selling it to Bob for $8,500."
