"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,250,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $1,175,000 is still too far below my desired price point. To move forward, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000. This is a fair offer that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate with me. I appreciate you coming down on price, and I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,190,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering we are both making concessions.",1190000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down to $1,195,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal happen.",1195000.0,Alice,7,
