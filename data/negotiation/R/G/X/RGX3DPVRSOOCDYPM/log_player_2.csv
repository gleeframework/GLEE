Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At $1,195,000, Alice's offer is getting close enough to my ideal price point.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and there's always the risk that Alice might not budge much further.  It's a good deal and time to accept."
