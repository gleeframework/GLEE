"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $800,000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the significant value of the product and gives you a fair price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
