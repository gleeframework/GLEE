"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high quality and unique features, it's valued at $150 by many of our customers. Considering its worth to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your interest in it. Let's aim for a price that ensures you're satisfied with your investment while also allowing me to fairly compensate for the value provided. Would you be open to discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's opening message is full of sales tactics, suggesting the product is worth more than it likely is. 
* While $120 is less than your $150 maximum, there's room for negotiation.  You haven't seen the product firsthand, so starting with a rejection might lead to a better counter-offer from Alice."
