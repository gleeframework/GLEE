"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  He should try to negotiate with Alice, and if that fails, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob should start by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, leaving room for negotiation.  $9,000 is a good starting point as it is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, John offers the same product at a lower price. It is still worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  Bob can try to counteroffer again to see if he can get a price closer to John's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

Bob should counter with $9500. This is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It's a reasonable price point that might make Alice consider accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to ""BuyFromJhon"".  Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget, but John offers the same product for the same price.  There is no benefit to continuing negotiation with Alice.  Bob should buy from John to ensure he gets the best price."
