"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1100000.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I need to consider the value I've placed on this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1300000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not able to accept that, I may have to consider other options. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
