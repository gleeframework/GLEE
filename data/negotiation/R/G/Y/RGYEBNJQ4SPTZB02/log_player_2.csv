Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $9,250? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

We are now getting very close in price, and further haggling might not yield much more. Accepting at $9,250 is a good deal compared to John's $12,000 price."
