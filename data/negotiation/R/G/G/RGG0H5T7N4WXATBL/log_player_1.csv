Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** It allows for potential counteroffers and negotiation while still ensuring you get a profit.
* **It's a clear starting point:** This sets the tone for the negotiation and gives Bob a concrete number to work with.

Remember, I'm an AI, so I can't ""feel"" the negotiation or strategize like a human. If you were a real person, you might also consider:

* **Bob's financial situation:** If you know he's cash-strapped, you might offer a lower starting price to entice him.
* **Your relationship with Bob:** If you have a good relationship, you might be more willing to negotiate.
* **The market for this product:** If there's high demand, you might be more aggressive in your pricing."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $1,350,000 for your product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $1,375,000? This is a good compromise and ensures that both of us get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to offer $1,360,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise given our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is very close to my ideal price.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $1,400,000, it's unlikely he'll go higher. It's better to accept this offer than risk him walking away completely or having to deal with more rounds of counteroffers."
