"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you consider a price in that range?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. This is a good middle ground, considering the value of the product to you and the value I have for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $11,000? That's a fair offer, considering I could always buy it from John for $12,000.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about $13,500? This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the value of the product and the value I have for it. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer.  $13,500 is still a touch high for me.  Would you consider $11,500? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $13,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
