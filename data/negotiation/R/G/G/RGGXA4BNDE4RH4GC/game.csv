"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  I've put a lot into this product and $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.  What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,
