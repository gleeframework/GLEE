"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Can you consider it?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $18000, which is a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to try to get closer to the price I'm comfortable with. How about $14000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is still a bit higher than what you're comfortable with, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $16000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I've already made it clear that I'm not willing to go above $14000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to a mutually agreeable price. I'd like to make one last offer of $14000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000",14000.0,Bob,6,
