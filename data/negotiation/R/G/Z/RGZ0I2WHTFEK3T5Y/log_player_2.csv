You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget ($1,500,000). There's a lot of room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly higher than Alice's offer, but still well within my budget. This shows that I am interested in the product but also that I am not willing to pay Alice's initial asking price. This approach will hopefully incentivize Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still below what I believe the product is worth. There is still room to negotiate a better price. I'll reject the offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still leaving room for Alice to come down a bit. I want to show that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also not willing to pay an unreasonable amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget. At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially losing the deal to John outweighs the potential gains of a slightly lower price.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a reasonable price and avoid the risk of the negotiation stalling."
