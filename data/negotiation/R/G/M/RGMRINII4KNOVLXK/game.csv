"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. How about we start at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $750,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $750,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you meet me in the middle at $675,000?",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $675,000 is a bit more reasonable, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $675,000, which would be $712,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",712500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad to hear that you're getting closer to my price. However, I'm still not willing to go all the way to $695,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $712,500 and $695,000, which would be $703,750. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",703750.0,Alice,7,
