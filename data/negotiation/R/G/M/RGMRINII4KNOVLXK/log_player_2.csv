It's getting very close to the end of the negotiation and Alice is consistently moving towards your price point. While you might get a slightly better deal in the last round, the difference is likely to be minimal and you risk Alice not budging further. Accepting at $701,375 guarantees a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at the higher price."
