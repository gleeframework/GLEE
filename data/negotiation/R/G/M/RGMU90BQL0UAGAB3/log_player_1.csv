"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum:**  I want to maximize my profit, and this price allows for potential negotiation.
* **It's a ""round"" number:**  People are more likely to respond to clean numbers.

I'll be watching Bob's reaction and adjusting my strategy based on his response."
