"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum of $100.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $90 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering you value the product at $120. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but I'm still a bit away. I'm willing to meet you at $98. Can we make it work at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $98 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still only one round away from being able to sell to John for $100. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $101. This is a fair compromise considering your initial value of $120.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 101}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit tired of going back and forth, but I'm still willing to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $97. Can we finally make a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $97 is still below my minimum of $100. While I could continue negotiating, I'm only two rounds away from having to sell to John for $100.  I'm going to take the guaranteed sale to John and cut my losses."
