"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its true worth. Would you consider selling it to me for $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $10,500. This price is still a great deal considering the product's value, and it would allow us both to walk away happy. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I believe we can still reach a fair compromise. I would like to propose a price of $10,200 for the product. This allows us to stay close to the value you're offering while keeping the cost reasonable for me. I hope this suggestion will be acceptable.",10200.0,Bob,4,
