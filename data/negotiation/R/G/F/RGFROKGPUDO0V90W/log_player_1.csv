{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects it, I'll be ready to counter and aim for a price closer to his perceived value of $10,000.  However, I'll always keep John's offer of $10,000 in mind as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its true worth. Would you consider selling it to me for $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that's lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'll counter with a price closer to $10,000, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.  John's offer remains a safety net in case the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $10,500. This price is still a great deal considering the product's value, and it would allow us both to walk away happy. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I believe we can still reach a fair compromise. I would like to propose a price of $10,200 for the product. This allows us to stay close to the value you're offering while keeping the cost reasonable for me. I hope this suggestion will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,200 is above my minimum value of $10,000, and it's a reasonable compromise. It's a good deal for me, and it avoids the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with John's lower offer."
