"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd like to offer $10,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous counteroffer, but I'm not going to go any lower than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I'm not going to budge from there. This is my final offer on this price point.",12000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up slightly from my last offer.  Would you consider $11,500?  This feels like a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our goals.",11500.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I'm not going to give up on getting a bit more. I'll make one more concession and meet you exactly in the middle at $11,750. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal at this price.",11750.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $11,750 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $11,625? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",11625.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can meet you at $11,625, but I'm going to add a condition: I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $500. This way, you'll be getting the product and the service for the price of $11,625. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",11625.0,Alice,9,,500.0
