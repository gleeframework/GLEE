"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm not quite ready to meet that price point.  How about we start at $650,000 and see if we can find some middle ground?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm open to further discussions, but I'm not willing to go below $800,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $725,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value of the product to you and the initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for continuing this negotiation.  While $800,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you be willing to settle at $750,000? I think that's a strong offer, and it would allow us to close this deal today.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you and our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $775,000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,7,
