"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm not quite ready to meet that price point.  How about we start at $650,000 and see if we can find some middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.
