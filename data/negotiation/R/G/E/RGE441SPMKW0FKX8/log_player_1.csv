Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I think you'll find it very valuable, but I'm only offering it to you at this price before considering other buyers. Would $150 interest you?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning other buyers creates a sense of scarcity and value.
* **Leaving Room:** Offering the product at $150 allows room to negotiate down to $100 if Bob shows resistance. 
 
Remember, you have a guaranteed buyer at $100, so any amount above that is a win!"
