"I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider it?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $105?  I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. Can you consider it?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $95 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",100.0,Alice,5,
