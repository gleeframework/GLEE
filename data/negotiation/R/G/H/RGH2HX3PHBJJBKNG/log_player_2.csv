"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by many of our customers. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. For this exceptional item, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $95. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own something truly special at a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is lower than John's price of $100, it's still above your $100 budget. By rejecting her offer, you can see if she'll come down further in price.  You always have John's offer as a fallback."
