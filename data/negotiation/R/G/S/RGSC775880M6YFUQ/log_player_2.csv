"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it's a great deal, let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's better to negotiate or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a low offer ($60) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. This tactic aims to understand Alice's lowest acceptable price.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message maintains a polite and interested tone to encourage continued negotiation. 
* **Target Price in Mind:** My goal is to buy the product for significantly less than John's $80 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $60 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $100 is closer but still above your $80 maximum budget and significantly more than John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's likely still room for negotiation. Alice seems willing to move from her initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** Increasing the offer to $75 shows willingness to compromise but keeps it below the $80 threshold.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding ""ready to buy right now"" might encourage Alice to accept to close the deal quickly. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** While not explicitly mentioned, the knowledge that John offers the product for $80 provides a bargaining chip."
