Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway though. How about $9,000?  This still represents a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $8,750 is still too far from what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $9,250. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest and allows me to move forward.  What do you say?
