"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway though. How about $9,000?  This still represents a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $8,750 is still too far from what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $9,250. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest and allows me to move forward.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we meet on this price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
