Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we have a strong alternative buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This allows us to start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still very favorable for you (Alice). 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price without revealing your minimum acceptable price.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** You get a fantastic deal at $1,300,000, exceeding your minimum by $500,000.
* **If Bob Negotiates:** You have room to bargain and still likely reach a price well above your $1,500,000 alternative.
* **If Bob Rejects:** You haven't lost anything and can proceed to sell to John at your desired price."
