"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to make this deal work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value you place on the product",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $950,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution, but $1,050,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your constraints. Let's meet in the middle at $1,015,000. This is a small increase from your last offer, but it's the best I can do at this point.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us.",1015000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,015,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price",990000.0,Bob,8,
