Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I think there's room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value you place on the product 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with that figure. I think there's still room for negotiation and I want to see if we can reach a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm determined to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $950,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution, but $1,050,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

I'm still not happy with the price, but I'm getting closer to my desired outcome. I'll make one final counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement before I sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints. Let's meet in the middle at $1,015,000. This is a small increase from your last offer, but it's the best I can do at this point.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1015000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,015,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are not progressing as I'd hoped. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. With only 2 rounds left, it's highly unlikely that Bob will significantly raise his offer. Therefore, I'll take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John and sell the product to him."
