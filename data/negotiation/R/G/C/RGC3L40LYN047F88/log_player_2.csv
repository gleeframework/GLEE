"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $90. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also reflects that the product is worth $80 to Alice, and I'm aiming for a price that is fair for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $100, which is a good compromise.  Accepting this offer saves me $20 compared to buying from John, and it's still within my budget. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal and having to pay $120 to John outweighs the potential savings."
