"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You are willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is asking for $120. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation since the product is worth $80 to Alice. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  You can always buy from John if negotiations fail, so you have leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering $100, which is a significant reduction from Alice's $120 offer. 
* **Middle ground:**  This price is likely acceptable to Alice as it's above her value of $80 but still below your maximum of $150. 
* **Room for compromise:**  If Alice rejects, I can still make further adjustments in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to my target:**  $110 is only $10 more than my initial counteroffer of $100.
* **Time is a factor:**  We are already in round 3, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing too hard.
* **John's offer is still available:**  If I need to, I can still buy from John, so I'm not taking a huge risk by accepting."
