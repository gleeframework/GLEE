"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$850,000 is a good price, but there's a significant chance I can get it for even less by negotiating. I have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 30% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal, and it gives me room to negotiate if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but I still have 7 rounds to negotiate. There's a chance I can get it even lower, especially since she rejected my counteroffer.  I'm not yet willing to pay $725,000 and risk losing out on a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 675000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $675,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping Alice will see that I'm serious about buying the product and will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now closer to my desired price, and I'm concerned about running out of rounds.  While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk that I won't get a better offer and will be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  $700,000 is a reasonable price, and I'm comfortable accepting it at this point."
