"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for potential compromise. I'm confident in my minimum value of $100, so I'm leaving some wiggle room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a fair offer considering the product is worth $80 to Bob. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer and will hopefully lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired amount.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. I'm willing to compromise a bit further to reach a deal with Bob, but I still need to make a profit and can't go lower than $95. This price represents a reasonable compromise and hopefully will lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $100.  While I would prefer to close the deal with Bob, it seems we're at an impasse.  I've already lowered my price significantly, and I don't want to continue negotiating with Bob if he's unwilling to budge further.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and I'm comfortable with this outcome."
