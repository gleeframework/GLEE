"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a high price, but it's a truly unique and valuable item. I'm confident you'll see the return on your investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high price. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is a far cry from my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still a little too high for me. I could do $700,000.  That feels like a fair offer considering its value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle at $850,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're invested in this deal, and so am I.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,
