{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a high price, but it's a truly unique and valuable item. I'm confident you'll see the return on your investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high price. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I'm not ready to accept Bob's low offer, but I'm not ready to give up on him yet. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is a far cry from my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still a little too high for me. I could do $700,000.  That feels like a fair offer considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle at $850,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're invested in this deal, and so am I.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still too low for me. I'm not confident I can get a better offer from him, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds. It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
