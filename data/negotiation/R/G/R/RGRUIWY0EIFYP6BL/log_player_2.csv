"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to your budget than Alice's product's true worth, you can likely get a better deal.  You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $800,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to be aggressive while remaining within my budget.  This demonstrates my seriousness about buying the product while also pushing Alice towards a more favorable price."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my budget. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get it lower.  With 7 rounds remaining and the option to buy from John, there's still time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still staying below my budget, and hoping to meet somewhere in the middle.  This approach shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my financial goals."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a pattern of stubbornness, and we're only halfway through the rounds.  While her offer is getting closer, it's still above my budget.  At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially not getting a better deal is higher than the benefit of potentially getting a slightly lower price.  I'm choosing to buy from John to guarantee a purchase within my budget and avoid further time-consuming negotiations."
