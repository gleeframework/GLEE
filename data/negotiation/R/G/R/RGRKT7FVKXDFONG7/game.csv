"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make a profit on this sale.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to pay $150. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
