"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $8500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7750. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I appreciate your offer, but $7750 is still a bit below my desired price. How about $8250?  It's a good compromise and a fair price for the value this product offers.  Let's try to close this deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that we're getting close, but $8250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $7875. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",7875.0,Bob,6,
