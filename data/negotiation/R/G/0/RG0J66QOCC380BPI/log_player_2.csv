"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $120 by you. I understand its importance to you and would like to extend this opportunity. I am proposing to sell it to you for $100, a significant discount from its original value. This is my best offer, and I hope it aligns with your expectations. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120 and also less than buying it from John for $120. Accepting this offer saves you the most money."
