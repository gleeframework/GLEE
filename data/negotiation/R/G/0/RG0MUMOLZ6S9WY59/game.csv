"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer,  $8,750 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's split the difference at $8,875.  This allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
