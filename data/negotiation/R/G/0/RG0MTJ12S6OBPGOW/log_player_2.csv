"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do.  I know you value it at $800,000, so this is a significant opportunity to acquire it. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested party who is willing to pay $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. You have a strong alternative with John, so there's no need to settle for a price that's $200,000 more than you're willing to pay."
