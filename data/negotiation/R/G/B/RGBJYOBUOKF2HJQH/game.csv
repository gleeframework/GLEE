"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's meet halfway.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $130 is still not quite enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal.",140.0,Alice,5,
