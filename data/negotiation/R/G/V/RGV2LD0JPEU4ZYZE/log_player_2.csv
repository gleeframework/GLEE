"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something you value at $15,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's still very fair. I'm asking for $12,000.  This is a great opportunity to get something you really want at a price that works for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $12,000, which is $3,000 less than John's price. 
* **You're still saving money:** You value the product at $15,000, so even paying $12,000 is a good deal for you."
