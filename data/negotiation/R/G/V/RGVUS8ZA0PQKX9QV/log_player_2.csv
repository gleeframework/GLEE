"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $120. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within my budget. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $135 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my price point, it's still above my maximum of $120.  I'll continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal. There are still rounds left, and I might be able to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $125, which is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to inch closer to my maximum price point. $125 is still a good deal for Alice, and I'm hoping this offer will be accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can do $130 for the product, which is my absolute lowest price. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my price point, but $130 is still above my limit of $120. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get her to drop the price even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $130 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $128.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal."", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product.  $128 is a good compromise, as it's only $2 above my maximum price point but also a good deal for Alice, allowing her to make a small profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going below $132. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can do $131 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $131
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above my maximum price point of $120.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've only got a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk running out of time and not getting the product at all. 

Since John is willing to sell me the product for $120, it makes more sense to purchase from him to ensure I get the item at my desired price."
