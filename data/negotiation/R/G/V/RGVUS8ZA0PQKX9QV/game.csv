"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you say?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $135 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love it!",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $125, which is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can do $130 for the product, which is my absolute lowest price. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $130 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $128.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.",128.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going below $132. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can do $131 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",131.0,Alice,7,
