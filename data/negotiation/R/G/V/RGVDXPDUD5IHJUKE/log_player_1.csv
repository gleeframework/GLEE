"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive message:**  I'm trying to create a friendly and open atmosphere, hoping to encourage Bob to negotiate.
* **$110 is above my minimum:** It's important to start above my minimum price of $100 to have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I still have room to negotiate with Bob. While his offer is low, it shows he's interested. 
* **Keeping options open:** By rejecting his offer, I keep the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  $90 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer above my minimum:** I'm still aiming to get a price above my minimum of $100.
* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Positive and open tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to encourage continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's the lowest I can go on this. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob's compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our last offers ($95 and $105).
* **My minimum price:** This is my minimum price, so it's the lowest I'm willing to go.
* **Clear and concise:** The message is short and to the point, making it clear what I'm proposing."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's very close to my minimum price of $100, I'm not willing to sell for less. 
* **Time is running out:** We're halfway through the negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John.
* **John's offer is a sure thing:**  Selling to John for $100 ensures I meet my minimum price and eliminates any risk of further negotiation with Bob."
