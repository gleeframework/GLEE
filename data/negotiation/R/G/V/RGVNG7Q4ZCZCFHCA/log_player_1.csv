Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to entice Bob and justify the high price. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John for your minimum acceptable price.

By setting the initial offer high, you increase the chance of securing a deal closer to Bob's maximum valuation while still having the safety net of John's offer."
