"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think!",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's a fair price for both of us and I believe you'll still find it a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. This price would allow both of us to come away happy with the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
