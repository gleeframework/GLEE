# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can definitely do better than $12,000. You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $10000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  How about $11000?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$11,000 is a good price for you, as it's still below your maximum budget and gives Alice a reasonable profit. It's a win-win situation."
