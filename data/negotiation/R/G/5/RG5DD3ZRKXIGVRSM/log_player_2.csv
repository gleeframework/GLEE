"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price that's very fair considering its value. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's talk about $12,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can still do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or at least explore other options."
