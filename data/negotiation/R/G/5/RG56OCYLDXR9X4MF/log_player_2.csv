Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too far below the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still represents a good deal for you.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
