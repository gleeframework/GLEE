"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is far beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and a reasonable profit for you. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also considering my minimum price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is closer to my budget and still offers you a significant profit. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum price. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
