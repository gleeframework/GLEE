"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  While it's a ""fair"" compromise from her perspective, it's not fair to you. You're much better off rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also considering my minimum price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,050,000 is still too high.  It's worth rejecting this offer and trying to negotiate a lower price. You are still within your budget to potentially get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is closer to my budget and still offers you a significant profit. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum price. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,000,000, which is still above your budget. While there's always a chance she might come down further, it's getting risky to keep negotiating. You've already made multiple counteroffers and she's shown a willingness to meet you halfway.  At this point, it's safer to buy the product from John for $800,000. You'll save yourself a significant amount of money and avoid the potential of further negotiation that might not lead to a favorable outcome."
