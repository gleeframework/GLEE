Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, leaving room for negotiation but still significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.
* **John as Safety Net:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not under immense pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired price, $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This would still give you a great deal, and it's the closest I can come right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by dropping my price from $13,000 to $12,000.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm again highlighting the product's value to Bob, emphasizing the ""great deal"" he'd be getting.
* **Limited Flexibility:** I'm suggesting this is my final offer, implying I'm less flexible to avoid being pushed further down. 
* **Maintaining Upper Hand:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving me in a good negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:** While I'd prefer more, there's a chance Bob won't budge further.  Accepting now avoids further negotiation and the risk of him backing out altogether.
* **Time is Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation could be costly, especially if Bob ultimately walks away. 
* **Secure a Profit:**  This deal still guarantees a profit for me, and it's the best offer I've received so far."
