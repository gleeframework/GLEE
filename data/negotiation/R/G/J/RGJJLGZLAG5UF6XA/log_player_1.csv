"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $100 to me. This gives me some room to negotiate and also sets the expectation that I won't give it away cheaply."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit.  This demonstrates flexibility without completely conceding."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, and we are already on round 4.  There's a good chance he will not go higher, and I'm taking the risk of him walking away.  $95 is a decent profit, and it's better than selling to John for $100 at this point."
