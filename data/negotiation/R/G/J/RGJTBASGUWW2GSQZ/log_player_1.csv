"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. This allows for potential negotiation and gives me room to adjust if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy with the $12,000 price, I'm not rushing into a deal just yet. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a compromise.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is higher than John's offer of $12,000, and it's getting close to my initial asking price. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing this sale by continuing to negotiate."
