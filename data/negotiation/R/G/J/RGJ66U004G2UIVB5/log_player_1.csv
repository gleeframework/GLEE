Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll be ready to counter any offers Bob makes, but if he's not willing to come close to my asking price, I'll happily sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$100 is way too low for me. I'll counter with a higher price, but I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob isn't willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm dropping the price slightly to $130. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $115 is still below my initial goal, it's getting closer to my minimum. I'd rather sell to Bob for $115 than sell to John for $120. It's worth taking the slightly lower price to avoid the hassle of finding a new buyer."
