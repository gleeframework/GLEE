Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is not feasible for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to consider my own investment in the product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down some.  $16,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we potentially agree on something around $12,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I have a firm budget.  To be honest, anything over $11,000 is pushing it for me. If you're willing to consider that, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.
