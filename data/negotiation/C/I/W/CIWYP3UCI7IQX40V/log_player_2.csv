"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good deal, it's still above my maximum budget of $120. I'm going to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to do $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $112. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  While $112 is still a bit more than I wanted to pay, it's within my budget and a better deal than buying from John for $120. I'll accept Alice's offer."
