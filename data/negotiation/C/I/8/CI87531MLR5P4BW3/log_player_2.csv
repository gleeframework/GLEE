"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John. There's room for negotiation before hitting my $12,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
 ""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's $1,000 less than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for further negotiation, but also moves the price closer to a range that would save me a significant amount compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000,  which reflects a compromise on my end. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is meeting me halfway, but I think there's still a chance to negotiate a slightly better price. I'll try one more time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we settle at $10,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
 ""product_price"": 10750
}
``` 

I'm splitting the difference between her counteroffer and my last offer. This keeps the negotiation moving and aims for a price that's beneficial for both of us."
