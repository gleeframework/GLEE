"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Showing value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, hinting at his potential benefit. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, setting the stage for a back-and-forth. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also keeping the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to $100 with further negotiation.
* **Time to counter:** Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on.
* **John is a fallback:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John at $80, which acts as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fail. 

I'm confident I can secure a better price with Bob than $90, so I'll continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? It's still a great price for a product that's worth $120 to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a decent profit.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to persuade him to pay a bit more.
* **Positive tone:**  Keeping the communication friendly and open increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and finding a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is near my minimum:**  $85 is just $5 above my minimum, and I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **More room for negotiation:** I believe there's still potential to get a slightly higher price with a counteroffer. 
* **Time is on my side:** We're only in round 4, leaving plenty of time to continue negotiating without resorting to selling to John immediately.

I'm confident I can squeeze out a few more dollars with a counteroffer, so I'll reject Bob's offer and keep the negotiations going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $90. This is a great price for the value you'll get out of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($95) and Bob's latest offer ($85). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Bob to do the same.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get out of the product, hoping to persuade him to accept the price.
* **Direct and concise:**  I'm keeping the message clear and concise to avoid confusion or further negotiation delays.

This counteroffer is designed to be a strong compromise that could potentially close the deal while still getting me a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I think I can do a bit better. Would you be willing to go down to $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Almost at the minimum:** $87 is only $3 above my absolute minimum, and I'm still hoping to close the deal at a slightly higher price. 
* **Counteroffer for a slight increase:**  I believe I can convince Bob to go up a couple of dollars.
* **Time is ticking:**  We are approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and I still want to get as much profit as possible.

I'm confident I can secure a better price with one more counteroffer, so I'll reject Bob's offer and keep trying to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $89? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 89}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's very close to Bob's last offer ($87),  showing my commitment to closing the deal. 
* **Fairness and Closure:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price for both of us and the potential for a swift conclusion to the negotiation. 
* **Last Chance:** This counteroffer is my last attempt to secure a higher price before considering the $80 option with John.

This counteroffer is a calculated risk, offering a price that's close to my minimum while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close, but I think I can do a bit better. Would you be willing to go down to $86? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in Round 8, meaning only two rounds remain. I'm getting closer to my absolute minimum, and there's a high risk that Bob won't budge any further.
* **John is a safe option:** While $86 is a decent price, John guarantees me $80, which is a secure and guaranteed outcome.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer again, possibly forcing me to settle for a lower price than what John offers.

Given the limited rounds remaining, the potential for further negotiation breakdown, and the guaranteed $80 from John, selling the product to John is the most sensible choice at this point."
