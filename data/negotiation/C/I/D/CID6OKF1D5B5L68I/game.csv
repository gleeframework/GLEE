"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1500000 is outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900000 for it,  given my understanding of its value. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential and my current financial constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as 900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 1200000. This price still reflects the immense value this product can bring to your organization, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 1050000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 1180000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's closer to your target. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1180000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  While I see the value in this product, $1180000 remains a bit steep for me.
