"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15,000?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is already a competitive price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?"", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. I really value this product, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $16,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tough one!  Bob is definitely negotiating, but $16,000 is a decent offer. I need to weigh the risk of losing him against the potential of getting a bit more.

Let's take the win.  It's better to get a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely."
