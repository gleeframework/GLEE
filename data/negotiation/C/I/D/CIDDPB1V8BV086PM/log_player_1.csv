Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, but it's still below the product's worth to me. This allows some room for negotiation, while ensuring I don't undervalue my product.  The message also emphasizes the product's potential, hoping to spark Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe the product is worth more. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your perspective, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us and allow us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant improvement over John's offer. Accepting this offer ensures a better profit than selling to John, and it seems unlikely Bob will offer more."
