# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is a better deal than buying from John for $150. Even though you are willing to pay up to $150, accepting Alice's offer saves you $20."
