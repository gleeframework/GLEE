"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Could we settle on a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $700,000. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to be flexible, but I think $750,000 is still a bit low considering the product's value. How about we meet in the middle again at $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm ready to make a deal, but $825,000 is pushing my budget. I can offer you $775,000. If you're willing to accept this, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I may have to consider other options.",775000.0,Bob,6,
