You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

This counter-offer attempts to move the negotiation significantly closer to our ideal price while leaving room for further negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $700,000. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is coming down, but we can likely negotiate a better price. We're still closer to her value than ours."

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",

}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground while still aiming for a price closer to Bob's ideal. We are moving in smaller increments now, which shows willingness to compromise but also firmness on our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to be flexible, but I think $750,000 is still a bit low considering the product's value. How about we meet in the middle again at $825,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but we're getting close to John's offer.  We'll push one more time to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm ready to make a deal, but $825,000 is pushing my budget. I can offer you $775,000. If you're willing to accept this, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I may have to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 775000
}
```

This offer:

* **Establishes urgency**: By saying we're ""ready to make a deal"" but have ""other options,"" we signal that this is our best offer and Alice should accept it quickly.
* **Shows flexibility**:  We are moving closer to her offer, indicating our willingness to compromise for a deal.
* **Sets a firm limit**:  We're implying that $775,000 is our final offer, and going any higher might mean walking away and taking John's offer."
