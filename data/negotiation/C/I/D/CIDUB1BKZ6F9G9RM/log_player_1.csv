Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin for Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Justification:**  While a price justification isn't explicitly provided, framing the offer around ""value and potential"" subtly implies that the product's worth might even exceed the asking price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy is risky.  If Bob is turned off by the high price, he might walk away without further negotiation.
* Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate.  She has a strong fallback option with John, but aiming too high could make reaching an agreement with Bob difficult."
