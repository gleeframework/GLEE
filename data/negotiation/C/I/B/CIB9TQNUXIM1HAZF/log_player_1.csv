Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Friendly approach:** The message is friendly and engaging, trying to build a positive rapport with Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is open to negotiation, inviting Bob to share his thoughts. 

This strategy allows me to test the waters and see how Bob values the product. It also gives me an opportunity to learn more about his needs and interests, which might help me adjust my strategy in future rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere within my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While $90 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $80. Accepting this offer would mean losing money.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe I can negotiate a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback option:**  While selling to John for $80 is guaranteed, I'd prefer to explore the possibility of getting a better price from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and proceeding to the next round, I'm maintaining my position and showing Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. This might incentivize him to come up with a more competitive offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $90 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a counteroffer of $95, which is a midpoint between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows that I'm taking his offer seriously.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the value proposition of the product, reminding Bob that it's worth the price. This can help him see the potential benefits and encourage him to reconsider his position.
* **Positive and persuasive tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and persuasive, aiming to build a sense of mutual understanding and agreement.

This counteroffer strategy aims to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome while also ensuring I don't sell below my minimum threshold. It's important to maintain a balance between being assertive and accommodating in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my needs, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $92 for the product. This allows us to stay close to the midpoint while still keeping it within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, there's a chance that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a prolonged process.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and guarantees a profit above my minimum threshold.  There's always a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower price or a situation where I need to sell to John for $80.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm making a pragmatic decision that balances the potential for a higher price with the need to secure a sale and minimize risk."
