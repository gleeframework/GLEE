"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers at $150. This would be a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $160. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $158?",158.0,Alice,5,
