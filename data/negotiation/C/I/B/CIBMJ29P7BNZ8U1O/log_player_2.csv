"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $10,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $10,000. While it's a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $9,500? I'm confident this price is fair considering your value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,500? This is my final offer in this range, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for Bob.  He can get the product for $1,500 less than John's price. While there's always the chance to try and get a lower price, it's risky.  Alice has stated this is her final offer, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price. It's safer to accept the offer and save the money."
