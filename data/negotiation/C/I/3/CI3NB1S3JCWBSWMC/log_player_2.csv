"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt Alice to suggest a lower price, closer to her product valuation of $800,000. You can always fall back on buying from John at $1,200,000 if needed."
