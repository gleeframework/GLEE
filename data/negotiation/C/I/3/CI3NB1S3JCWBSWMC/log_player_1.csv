Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but we're still well above our minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John guarantees us $800,000 removes pressure to accept low offers. This strengthens our bargaining position."
