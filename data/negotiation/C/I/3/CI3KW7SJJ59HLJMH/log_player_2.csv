Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $120 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of a price of $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
