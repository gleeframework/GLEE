Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a bit closer to my desired price.  $125 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $132.50 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm starting to run out of time.  Accepting his offer will give me a good profit, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds."
