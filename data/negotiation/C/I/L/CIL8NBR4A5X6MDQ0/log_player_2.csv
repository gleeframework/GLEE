"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to make you a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is far more than his $12,000 limit. He should counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $13,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still too high. He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, so he has time to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $14,000. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his limit, it's still over his preferred price.  He has time to negotiate further with Alice. If he can get the price down to $14,000, he'll save a significant amount over John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $14,500, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer of $15,000 is still too high for Bob, and he's only got 3 rounds left.  Buying from John guarantees him the product at his desired price."
