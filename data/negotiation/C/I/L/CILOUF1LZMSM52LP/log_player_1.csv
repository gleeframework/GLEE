"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180.  It's a good starting point, giving Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  There's still time to negotiate, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm countering with $165.  This is still above Bob's offer but closer to his range, showing I'm willing to compromise.  It's a fair price that allows me to make a decent profit, but also gives Bob some room to negotiate if he's still keen."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $155 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150 and I'm running out of rounds. It's a good compromise and a decent profit.  I'll accept his offer to close the deal."
