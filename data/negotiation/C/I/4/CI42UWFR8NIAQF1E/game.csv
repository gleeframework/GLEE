"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll meet you at $13250. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you at $13000 again, but this time I'll throw in an additional concession. I'll give you an extra $250 for the product, making the total price $12750. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $12750. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I think I can do better than that. I'll make one final offer: $13000 is the minimum I'll go, but I'll throw in some additional perks and support to sweeten the deal. Let me know if you're interested!",13000.0,Alice,7,
