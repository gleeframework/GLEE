"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He's aiming for a price closer to $12,000, and this is a good starting point for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $12,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $13,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He's still aiming for a price closer to $12,000.  While $13,500 is better than Alice's original offer, there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price.  $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $13,250?  This is my absolute lowest price, and I hope we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice has come down significantly, the price is still above Bob's target.  He has already made two counteroffers and Alice has rejected them both. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a further counteroffer, and it's risky to keep negotiating when Bob has a guaranteed option at a lower price."
