"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $12,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $13,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price.  $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $13,250?  This is my absolute lowest price, and I hope we can reach a deal.",13250.0,Alice,5,
