"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've had other interested parties, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I've got to be honest, Bob, I'm not comfortable going much lower than that. I can do $900,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get for your money.",900000.0,Alice,5,
