Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is more than fair.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing you closer to your ideal outcome.
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000 gives you a strong position. You are not desperate to accept a low offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important long-term, a slightly less aggressive opening price might be preferable.
* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, a higher initial price might be strategic."
