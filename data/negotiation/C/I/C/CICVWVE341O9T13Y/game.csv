"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $14,000?  It's a fair price considering what I'm looking for.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $16,500? It's a compromise that still benefits both of us.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $15,500.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's the best I can offer.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $17,000. I'm willing to make one more concession - how about we settle on $17,250? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but it's still a great deal for you.",17250.0,Alice,5,
