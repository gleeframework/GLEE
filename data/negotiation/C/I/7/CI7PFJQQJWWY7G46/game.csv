"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $170. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $140? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm sure we can find a deal here.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm thinking of offering you a compromise - how about $160? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little too high for my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $150. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. ",150.0,Bob,4,
