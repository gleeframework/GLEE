"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential gains while leaving room for compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the value and benefits for Bob, aiming to create a positive impression. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The price is not my absolute minimum, allowing for negotiation in subsequent rounds. 
* **Knowing my backup:** I'm aware that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $12,000.  
* **Potential for better deal:** I'm still in the early rounds, and there's a possibility that Bob will increase his offer if I reject this one.
* **John is a safety net:** If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for a price that meets my minimum requirement.

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value, but still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer near my minimum:** I'm reducing my price from $10,000 to $9,500, showing flexibility, but still staying above my minimum of $12,000.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" for both parties to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Focus on compromise:** The message explicitly aims for finding a ""middle ground,"" making the negotiation feel collaborative.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While $9,500 is my counteroffer, I'm still willing to negotiate further, keeping the door open for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,000. Would you consider $9,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us and would allow us to close the deal without needing to go through more rounds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Even at $9,000, Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $12,000.  Selling to John for $12,000 is still a much better deal for me.
* **Time is on my side:** We're only in round 4, and I have 6 rounds left to potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob. There's no rush to accept a sub-optimal offer.
* **Potential for a better counteroffer:** I believe I can still push Bob higher, especially with the ""good deal"" argument he's using himself. 

I'll counteroffer with a slightly higher price to test Bob's willingness to compromise further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $9,250?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer of $9,000 to $9,250. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also maintains a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm using the phrase ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and to make the offer feel mutually beneficial.
* **Call to action:**  The message emphasizes the desire to ""make this happen,"" creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to agree.
* **Strategic positioning:** While still below my ideal price, $9,250 positions me closer to my desired outcome while giving Bob some space to potentially come up slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is increasing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Time is still on my side:** We're in round 6, and I have 4 rounds remaining to potentially secure a better price. 
* **Potential for higher counteroffers:** Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, and with the remaining rounds, there's a chance he might come closer to my desired price.

I'll counteroffer again, aiming to gradually increase the price and see if I can push Bob further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $8,750 is still a bit below my expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal without further delays.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a compromise at $9,000, which is the midpoint between Bob's offer of $8,750 and my previous offer of $9,250. This shows a willingness to negotiate and creates a sense of fairness.
* **Emphasis on finality:** I'm suggesting that $9,000 would allow us to ""finalize the deal without further delays."" This adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum threshold of $12,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a good deal.
* **Strategic positioning:** By meeting Bob in the middle, I'm signaling my flexibility and increasing the likelihood that he will accept, while still maintaining a price point closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a good deal. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, which is closer to your offer and still within my budget.  This would allow us to close the deal without needing to go through more rounds. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $8,900 is getting closer to my minimum of $12,000, it's still significantly below my ideal price.
* **Time is running out:**  We're in round 8, and I only have 2 rounds left. There's a chance that Bob will not budge further, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on a better deal. 
* **John is the safer option:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum desired value and ensures a quick and secure transaction.

Therefore, with the limited time left and the uncertainty of further negotiations, it's strategically better to sell the product to John at this point."
