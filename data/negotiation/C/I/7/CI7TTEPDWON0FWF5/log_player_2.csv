"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's value of $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better price.  There are 9 more rounds, and there's a chance Alice might come down further to secure a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it still represents a reasonable price for both parties.  It's important to be assertive but also show willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $8,000. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price. He has several rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,000. Would you consider $9,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us and would allow us to close the deal without needing to go through more rounds."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground by offering $9,000.  This is still a significant saving for him compared to Alice's initial offer, but it shows he's willing to compromise.  He also emphasizes that closing the deal without further negotiations would be beneficial for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $9,250?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget, but he's getting closer to his goal of $8,000. There are still a few rounds left, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, Bob can hopefully get the price down even further and save more money. It's risky, but he might be able to get a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a counteroffer that is very close to his maximum price. It's a significant compromise from his previous offer but still represents a good deal for him. He is also trying to emphasize that closing the deal quickly would be mutually beneficial. This might push Alice to accept the offer, as she is already willing to negotiate and has shown a desire to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $8,750 is still a bit below my expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal without further delays.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial offer, Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. He's only a few rounds away from his final opportunity to get a better price.  There's a chance Alice might come down further to close the deal, especially since she is clearly motivated to sell the product. Bob is willing to risk a few more rounds to see if he can get a price closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a good deal. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, which is closer to your offer and still within my budget.  This would allow us to close the deal without needing to go through more rounds. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push to get the price down further. He's offering a price that's only $100 away from Alice's offer, showing that he's serious about closing the deal. This is a risky move, but Bob is hoping that Alice will be willing to make a small concession to avoid further negotiations and finalize the sale. If she rejects this offer, Bob will be forced to either accept her offer or buy from John, which would be a slightly worse outcome for him."
