"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $8,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that work for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to get as close to $7,500 as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8,200? It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",8200.0,Alice,5,
