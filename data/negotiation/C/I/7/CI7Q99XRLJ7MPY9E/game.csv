"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,500 is significantly lower than what I need for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go any lower than that.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're willing to compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $6,750? I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",6750.0,Bob,4,
