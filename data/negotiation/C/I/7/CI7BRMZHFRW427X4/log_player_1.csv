"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob is interested but not willing to pay my initial price. It also sets the stage for a potentially profitable deal.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum,  I'm not going to settle for that right away. I need to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see where the negotiation goes from there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,250,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a significant profit for me. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my ideal price.  $1,150,000 is a good deal for both of us. I'm going to accept his offer and move on.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal in the future."
