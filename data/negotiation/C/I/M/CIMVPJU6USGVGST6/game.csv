"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. I would like to propose a price of $820,000 for your product. This still allows me to make a profit while ensuring that I am getting a valuable asset at a reasonable cost.",820000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not comfortable with that price.  It's still too far below the value of the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $880,000 for this to make sense for me.  This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",880000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $860,000 for your product. This is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while allowing me to acquire it within my budget.",860000.0,Bob,4,
