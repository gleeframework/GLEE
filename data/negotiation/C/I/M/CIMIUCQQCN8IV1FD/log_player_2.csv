"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and you're willing to pay up to that amount, you should reject Alice's offer. You have a guaranteed alternative with John at the same price. This strategy gives you no immediate benefit, but it keeps your options open for potentially finding a better deal later."
