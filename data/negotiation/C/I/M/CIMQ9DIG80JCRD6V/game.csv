"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $17,000. How about we meet in the middle from the original offer at $15,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",15000.0,Bob,4,
