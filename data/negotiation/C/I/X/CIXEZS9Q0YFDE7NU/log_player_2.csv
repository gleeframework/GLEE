"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. Although John offers the product for $10,000, Bob can still potentially get a better price from Alice, as the product is worth $8,000 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is $8,500, which is $1,000 less than Alice's offer. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. It's also important to note that Alice is likely to accept this offer, as it is still above the product's worth to her ($8,000)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than the product's worth to her. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is $8,750, which is halfway between his previous offer of $8,500 and Alice's latest offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price than Alice's current offer. It's likely that Alice will accept this offer as it's closer to her desired price point and closer to her actual value for the product."
