"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above my desired price range. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal.  I have 10 rounds, so I have time to explore options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to my target, I still have room to negotiate.  I'm aiming to get the price down to as close to $900,000 as possible. It's worth another round of counteroffers to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. I'm willing to come down to $935,000.  It's important to remember the value of this product to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering that. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $935,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $935,000 is getting closer to my target price of $900,000.  While I would prefer to pay less, the risk of further negotiation potentially increasing the price or running out of rounds is significant. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a price that is still within my budget and represents a substantial savings compared to buying from John."
