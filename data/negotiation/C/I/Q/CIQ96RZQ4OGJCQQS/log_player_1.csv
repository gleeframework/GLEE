Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500.  I'm open to discussing this further if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $10,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at $12,000.  Starting with a higher offer of $13,500 allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates Alice is open to discussion, suggesting flexibility on the price. This gives Bob the impression he might secure a deal and encourages him to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly anchors the price to a higher point without explicitly stating her own valuation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** This strategy assumes Bob is willing to negotiate. If Bob is known to be a tough negotiator or very price-sensitive, Alice might adjust her initial offer lower.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If Alice needs to sell quickly, she might offer a smaller discount to ensure a faster sale to Bob."
