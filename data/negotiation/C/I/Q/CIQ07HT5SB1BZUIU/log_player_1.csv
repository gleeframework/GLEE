Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but also leaving room for negotiation.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a drastic discount. I'll make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still staying above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is my minimum.  I'll take the sure thing."
