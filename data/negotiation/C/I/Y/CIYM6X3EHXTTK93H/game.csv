"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I'm on a tight budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,200?  This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",7800.0,Bob,4,
