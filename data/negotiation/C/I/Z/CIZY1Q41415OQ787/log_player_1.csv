Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation, which is important for potentially maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $60 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob before settling for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $90. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer.  Could you meet me in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $75 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired profit margin. I've already engaged in several rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk further concessions that might lead to a lower sale price. John is offering a guaranteed $120, which is my minimum value.  It's time to secure that sale."
