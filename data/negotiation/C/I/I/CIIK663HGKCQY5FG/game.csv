"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  $14,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm really hoping to land this product for $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can agree on that.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,5,
