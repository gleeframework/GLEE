"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125, which is a fair compromise. If this works for you, we can finalize the deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 was a bit high, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product for $150. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $150 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm happy to pay $135, which is a fair compromise and much closer to my budget. What do you say?",135.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 was a bit high, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product for $142.50. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal.",142.5,Alice,7,
