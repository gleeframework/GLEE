"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if she'll come down further. You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125, which is a fair compromise. If this works for you, we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $175 was a bit high, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product for $150. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $150 is still higher than your maximum budget of $100. Even though you're getting closer, it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get the price down even lower. You only have 5 rounds left, so it's important to make the most of each negotiation opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $150 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm happy to pay $135, which is a fair compromise and much closer to my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $150 was a bit high, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product for $142.50. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $142.5 is still above your budget, and with only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate down to your target of $100. At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John, who is offering the product at your desired price."
