Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a bit higher than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm hoping to get as close to my desired price as possible without risking losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to sell the product, $120 is significantly below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but a significant step down from my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a price point that's appealing to Bob without jeopardizing my own profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is still lower than I'd like, but it's close enough to my minimum value of $150 that it's worth accepting. If I reject, I risk having to sell to John for less. It's better to secure the sale now, even if it means a slightly lower profit."
