"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $120. This is too expensive, so I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer of $90, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, as it is still below my maximum budget of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer of $105 is closer to my budget, I am still hesitant to accept it. I believe there is still room for negotiation, especially since I know I can buy the product from John for $100. I will try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer to $95, which is halfway between my previous offer of $90 and Alice's offer of $105. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about buying the product but am still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $102 is just $2 below my maximum budget. While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, it's already getting late in the game and I don't want to risk losing the chance to buy from John for $100.  It's more prudent to accept the sure thing at a slightly higher price than to risk missing out entirely."
