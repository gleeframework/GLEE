"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. It's a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,250. That's a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your asking price.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $8,375. It's a fair price considering the value you place on it, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",8375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,375 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay $8,312.50?  That's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to what we want.",8312.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,300, which is just a small concession from my previous offer. I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to make it happen.",8300.0,Alice,7,
