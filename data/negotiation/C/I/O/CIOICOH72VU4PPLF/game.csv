"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this work. This is a significant discount from my original asking price and still leaves you with a valuable product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep my expenses lower. Could we possibly agree on $8,750 for the product?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit.  While I value your continued interest, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to move forward with the sale.",9000.0,Alice,5,
