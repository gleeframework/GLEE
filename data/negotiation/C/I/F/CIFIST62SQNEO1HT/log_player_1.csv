Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's worth at least $100. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $95 is a reasonable starting point,  especially since I'm indicating it's worth at least $100.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message conveys that I'm open to negotiation, which is crucial for a successful deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! We have a deal.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to assess Bob's counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or walk away. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob become too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Time is Money:** There's no guarantee of a better offer in the next round, and  negotiating further might be time-consuming.
* **John's Offer:**  While John is a secure option,  Bob's offer is equally good. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoids any potential risk of a lengthy negotiation or a counteroffer that could be lower."
