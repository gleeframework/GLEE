Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is well above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify paying over $1 million. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. This reflects its value to me, while leaving some room for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,400,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  Even at $1,400,000, I'm making a considerable profit.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Bob withdrawing his interest. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the capital available for other investments or opportunities. 

Waiting for a potential offer closer to $1,500,000 isn't worth the risk of losing Bob as a buyer entirely."
