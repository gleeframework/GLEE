Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  My initial offer is  $2,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is well above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify paying over $1 million. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. This reflects its value to me, while leaving some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, my valuation for this product is significantly higher, reflecting its true potential. Let's meet in the middle; I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still too high.  I need to continue negotiating to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  While $1,200,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to consider a more substantial move on my end if it means closing this deal. How about we settle at $1,600,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a lower price, I'm going to continue trying to negotiate a price closer to my budget.  I'm not going to jump at the first offer that's in my price range, especially since I still have some rounds left and can potentially buy from John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
