Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. I'm starting at $13,000, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference. How about $12,000? That leaves us both with a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I'm confident we can both be happy with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $11,500 is a good price, and it's getting close to my goal.  It's also better than selling to John for $10,000.  I'm happy with this deal."
