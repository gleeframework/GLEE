"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $8200. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $8200 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7800. Can we meet in the middle?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with $7800. I'm willing to consider a price of $8100. It's a small increase, but I believe it's still a fair compromise for both of us.",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $8100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,6,
