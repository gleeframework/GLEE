Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel valued and potentially more likely to engage.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** By stating I'm open to negotiation, I'm signaling to Bob that a deal is possible.

This strategy allows for potential bargaining while also ensuring I don't instantly lose out on a significant portion of the product's worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.**  Selling for $65 would result in a loss for me.
* **I have a better alternative:** Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Rejection allows me to control the negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control and can make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me.

While selling to John is a safe option, rejecting Bob's offer keeps the possibility of a better deal open. I will now counter with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable value and see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price for this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $90 is a compromise that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but still closer to my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Emphasize the value:** I remind Bob that $90 is still a fair price for the product, highlighting its worth.
* **Open the door to further negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"" I show a willingness to continue the negotiation, but I'm not giving away the farm just yet.

This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise while ensuring I don't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $75 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $100, and I'm not willing to sell at a loss.
* **John is a better option:** Selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed profit, making it a safer and more lucrative choice. 
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  While Bob's offer is closer, there's no guarantee he'll budge further, and I risk wasting more time in negotiations.

This time, I'm prioritizing certainty and a good return over the potential of a slightly better deal with Bob. Selling to John ensures I don't lose money and frees up my time to pursue other opportunities."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 is still below my minimum price for this product. I'm willing to go down to $85. If you're serious about buying it, this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm setting a clear boundary with this counteroffer, indicating that $85 is my absolute lowest price. This conveys a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.
* **Close to My Minimum:** $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $100 than Bob's offer, but still offers some room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I emphasize that this is my final offer, reminding Bob of the product's worth and the limited opportunity to purchase it.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob towards a deal closer to my desired price while keeping open the possibility of a sale.  However, I'm ready to walk away if he rejects it and sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
