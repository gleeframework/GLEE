"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price is fair and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.
