Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price is fair and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm confident that $1,075,000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.
