"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in.  It's worth at least $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a slightly lower price.  I'm sure you'll find it valuable, but I understand this is a significant investment. Let's find a price that works for both of us.  How does $1500000 sound?   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
