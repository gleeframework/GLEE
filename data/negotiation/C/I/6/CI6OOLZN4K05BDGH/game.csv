"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $100 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $110 one last time. This is the best I can offer, and if we don't reach an agreement here, I'm going to have to move on.",110.0,Alice,7,
