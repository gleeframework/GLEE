"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price gives Bob enough incentive to counteroffer, allowing us to potentially reach a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $100 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price to keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Still above my minimum:** $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, giving me some room to potentially negotiate further."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my goal of $120.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $112.50, which is a good compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise again:** I'm continuing to demonstrate a willingness to compromise by lowering my price again, but still maintaining a value above my minimum.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is insistent on $105, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer again, I can potentially push him closer to my desired price. It's getting a bit risky, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $110 one last time. This is the best I can offer, and if we don't reach an agreement here, I'm going to have to move on."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show urgency:** I'm highlighting that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and potentially pushing Bob to accept.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the fairness of my offer to convince Bob.
* **Prepared to walk away:** I'm signaling that I'm prepared to walk away if the deal doesn't work out, which could increase Bob's willingness to negotiate."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've already offered $105, and I'm not willing to go any higher. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a stalemate.  Bob is firmly at $105, and I'm not willing to go below $110.  We're only two rounds away from the deal expiring, and I'm not confident I can get Bob to budge. 

With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is too high.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $120 from John, even though it's not my ideal price."
