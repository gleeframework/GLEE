"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since the product is worth more to me than to Bob, I need to make sure I get a price that reflects its value.  Let's see what Bob's response is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still aim for a significant profit. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for more. I'll counteroffer in the next round.  John is a solid backup, but I want to see if I can close this deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price again, but only slightly.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm confident that I can get a better price than what John is offering. This is my last chance to make a good profit with Bob before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting tricky. I've already lowered my price significantly, and Bob isn't budging much.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price than what John is offering.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
