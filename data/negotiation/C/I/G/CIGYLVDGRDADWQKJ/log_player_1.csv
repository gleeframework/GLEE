Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The price range where both you and Bob might agree is between $1,000,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, but there's a catch. If Bob rejects your offer, you're going straight to John â€“ there's no counter-offering from Bob.

**The Offer**

Here's an option, balancing a high asking price with the risk of losing the deal:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you. I'm offering it at $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Price:**  This is a strong starting point within the ZOPA, leaving room for potential negotiation (though unlikely in this scenario).
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value reinforces the price. 
* **No Justification:** Avoid giving reasons for the price; it opens the door for counter-arguments.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might lower the price slightly to increase the chance of acceptance.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:**  Are you comfortable risking the $1,400,000 to potentially get a higher price from Bob?

**Remember:** This is just one offer strategy. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of the situation."
