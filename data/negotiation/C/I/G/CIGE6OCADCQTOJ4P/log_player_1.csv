"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting high with $18,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good starting point for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to settle for that price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from $18,000 to $15,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more attractive to Bob, while still allowing me to secure a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still too low.  Even though I'm approaching my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for $6,000. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating with the hope of getting closer to my desired price.  I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John, but I still have a few rounds to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer again to $13,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value and accept my offer. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to sell to John as I'm running out of negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I've already made significant compromises, and with only a few rounds left, I'm not confident I can get him to meet my price.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
