Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's a bit lower than Alice's initial offer. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll try to get closer to that price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.
