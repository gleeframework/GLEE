"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $95? I'd really like to make this purchase from you.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $102? That would be a fair price for both of us.",102.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand that $102 might be a bit high for my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate further? I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
