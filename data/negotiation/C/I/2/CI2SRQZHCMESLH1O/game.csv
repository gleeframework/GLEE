"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more compromise, but I'm afraid I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've reached my maximum budget of $8,000, and I'm not willing to go above that. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to make one final offer of $8,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I hope you can understand my position.",8000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to make one more offer, but it will be my final one. I'll offer the product to you for $13,000. This is the absolute minimum price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you can understand my position. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,9,
