"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",90.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $75 for the product. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $78 for the product.  Let's try to make a deal that works for both of us.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $78. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $81. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",81.0,Alice,5,
