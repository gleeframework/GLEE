{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better price.  There's no harm in trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $120.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. Hopefully, it's enough to pique her interest and start the negotiation process."
