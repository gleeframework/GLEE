{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is far too high.  It's not worth it to buy from Alice at that price. I'll reject her offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $120 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

$110 is still too expensive. I'll reject her offer and try to get closer to my budget."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $95 for the product. I really want to get this deal done, but that's the most I can do."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $95 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $105, and that's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $105 is still a bit too high. I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is the absolute max I can do.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it right now."", ""product_price"": 100}
