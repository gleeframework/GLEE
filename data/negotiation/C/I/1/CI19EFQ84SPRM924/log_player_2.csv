# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum value of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still above my maximum value of $120.  While it's closer to my target, I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get it lower.  If Alice doesn't budge, I'll still have the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit far from my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you at $107.50. That's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $107.50 is still within my budget and is a significant improvement on her previous offer. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject my offer, and I'll be forced to buy from John for a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price, and avoids further potential delays or complications."
