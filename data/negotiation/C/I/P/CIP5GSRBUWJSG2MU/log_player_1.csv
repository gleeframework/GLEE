"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
I'm starting with my absolute minimum price.  I know it's a lot, but this product is worth a great deal to me. I'm hoping Bob sees the value and is willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is too far below my minimum price, and I believe I can get closer to my target by continuing to negotiate. I'm confident that I can get a better deal than that, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial price, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price that reflects the value of the product to me.  I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's initial offer, and I'm hoping he'll see it as a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still not enough. I believe I can do better. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will continue negotiating to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm offering Bob $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm hoping it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution. This price is still above Bob's last offer, but it's within a range I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $975,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can do better. We're nearing the halfway point in our negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too far below my target. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,025,000. I'm making a final push to get closer to my desired price while still being reasonable.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I'm hoping Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me in the middle. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling to John. We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. I'm not willing to risk another round and potentially get a worse offer from Bob.  John is offering a much better price, and I'm going to go with the sure thing."
