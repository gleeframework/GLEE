Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your operations, offering significant long-term benefits. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a high anchor. Even though you're willing to go lower, this makes your final offer seem more reasonable.
* **Scarcity:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Profit Maximization:** While you have a guaranteed offer from John, aiming for a higher price with Bob allows you to potentially maximize your profit.  This offer price is a strong starting point for negotiation, leaving room to potentially settle closer to Bob's perceived value while staying well above your minimum."
