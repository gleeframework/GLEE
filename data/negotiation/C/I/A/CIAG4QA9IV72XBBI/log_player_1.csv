"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $115, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and potential benefit to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to discussion and willing to work with Bob.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to try and close the deal quickly while leaving some room for negotiation. I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and the number of rounds remaining. If I don't feel confident about closing a deal with Bob, I'll move on to John in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.
* **Room for compromise:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Time is on my side:** With 8 rounds remaining, I have the time to negotiate further.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll need to balance being firm about my value while showing willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $115 to $110.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the price as a ""fair price for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Direct question:** I'm asking a direct question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to close the deal as quickly as possible, but I also want to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm confident that I can get at least $110 for the product, so I'm sticking to my counteroffer. If Bob rejects again, I'll consider adjusting my counteroffer or moving on to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $107.50? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 6 rounds left, so I can continue negotiating.
* **Potential for higher offer:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to increase his offer further.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly higher price, aiming to get closer to my desired value. I'll try to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $108.50? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 108.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not all the way.
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair price"" that reflects the value of the product.
* **Maintaining my ground:**  I'm not completely giving in to Bob's demands, showing that I still value the product.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick resolution, but I'm also trying to squeeze out as much value as possible. I believe $108.50 is a reasonable compromise, and if Bob rejects, I'll re-evaluate my options in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $108.50. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my absolute limit. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $12 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited time:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high. There's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better deal.
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is $12 higher, I'm not guaranteed that he'll actually buy. It's safer to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale.

**Strategy:**

This is a strategic decision to accept Bob's offer. While it's below my ideal price, it's still a good deal considering the remaining time and the risk of not closing a deal."
