"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. This is to leave some room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product! $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price but still above my minimum. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $88 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $100.  I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation and it seems like we're not getting closer.  Instead of wasting more time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. It's a sure thing and ensures I get at least my minimum desired price."
