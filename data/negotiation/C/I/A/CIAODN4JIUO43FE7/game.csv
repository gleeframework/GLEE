"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. However, $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still provides a significant gain for you while remaining fair for me. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
