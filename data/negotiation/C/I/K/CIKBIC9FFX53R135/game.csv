"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm still not willing to let it go for $1200000. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.
