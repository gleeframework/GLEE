"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, don't you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
