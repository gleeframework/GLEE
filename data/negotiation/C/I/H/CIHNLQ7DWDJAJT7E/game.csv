"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $11500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13000. Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $12500? This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12500. I'm willing to offer the product for $13250, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",13250.0,Alice,5,
