"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than its full value. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price. Can you meet me in the middle?",8800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000. This is a fair price that considers your willingness to pay a premium. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal at this price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counteroffer at $8,900. Can you consider this price?",8900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $8,900 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,200 as a final offer. This price is still more than your initial offer and gives you a good deal. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",9200.0,Alice,5,
