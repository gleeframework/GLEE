"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to try and get a price closer to what the product is worth to me.  

By rejecting, I can continue the negotiation and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your response. I really value your product, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is still below my minimum price of $120, it's getting closer. We've already had several rounds of negotiation and it seems like Bob is being firm on his budget.  I'm taking a small loss, but it's better than risking further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for $120."
