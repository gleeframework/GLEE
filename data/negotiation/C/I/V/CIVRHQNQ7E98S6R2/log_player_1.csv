"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting to build rapport.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm hinting at the product's value to Bob without directly stating it.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-counteroffer. 
* I'll keep an eye on the number of rounds and be ready to switch to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a Backup:**  I'm aware of John's offer of $100, which I can use as a reference point for my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to bridge the gap. 
* I'll be mindful of the remaining rounds and consider switching to John if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $95? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""room for both of us to be happy,"" suggesting a win-win scenario.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** I'm not settling for Bob's price yet, leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  While $95 is above my minimum, John's offer of $100 still gives me a safety net.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide on my next move, potentially making another counteroffer or switching to John. 
* I'll continue to monitor the remaining rounds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're nearing the midpoint of the negotiation, and time is becoming a factor.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed $100 offer from John, which provides a strong safety net.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, potentially $90, to see if we can reach a compromise.
* I'll be prepared to switch to John if Bob continues to refuse offers above his $85 limit. 
* I'll continue to carefully evaluate the remaining rounds and adjust my strategy based on the progress of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising:** I'm lowering my price to $90, which is closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to find common ground.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using phrases like ""good deal"" and ""fair price"" to emphasize the benefits of accepting.
* **Confidence in the Product:**  I'm reaffirming my belief in the product's value to Bob.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds left, I'm applying a slight time pressure.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll have to decide whether to offer a further concession or switch to John, considering the remaining rounds.
* I'll continue to observe the negotiation dynamics and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $82.50 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  $82.50 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited Time:**  We're down to 4 rounds, and further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a satisfactory price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $100 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll contact John and finalize the sale. 
* While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, I've secured a profitable outcome."
