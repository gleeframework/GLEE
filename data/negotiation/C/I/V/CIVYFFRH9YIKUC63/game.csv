"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the value; however, I'm confident in the product's worth and need to get closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet halfway between our two offers at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
