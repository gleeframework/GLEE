{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation without you feeling pressured to accept a low price.
* **Is below Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob an incentive to accept and potentially make a profit.

However, keep in mind:

* **Negotiation is a dynamic process:** Bob's reaction will determine your next move. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on his counteroffer.
* **Always consider John's offer:**  If the negotiation with Bob stalls, you have a fallback option with John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to consider $900000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good amount, it's still significantly lower than the $1,200,000 I initially offered. There's potential to get closer to my desired price. I will try to negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1,000,000 for the product.  This still represents a great deal for you, and it's a price I can live with. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my desired price and represents a significant profit for me.  While I could potentially continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that Bob will come up further.  Accepting his offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer completely or having to settle for John's lower offer."
