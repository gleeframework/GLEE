"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,500. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
