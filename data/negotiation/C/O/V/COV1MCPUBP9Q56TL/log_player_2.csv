Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it's a good way to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she rejects this offer, I know her bottom line is likely higher than $1,000,000, giving me a better understanding of where to go in the next round."
