"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. By rejecting the offer, Bob can secure the product from John for $10,000, saving $1,500."
