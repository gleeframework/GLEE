"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,900000.0
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. My next offer is $850,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer. I think it's a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation.",850000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so my next offer is $800,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",800000.0,Alice,7,,
