"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price before selling to John.  Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I want, and I still have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
