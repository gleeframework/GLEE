Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:** We aim for a price higher than John's offer ($12,000) but lower than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By presenting a ""limited-time offer,"" we encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially accept the offer before considering alternatives.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
