Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to discuss this price further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($14,500) leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing you a better price than John's offer. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While the price is high, the message also suggests openness to discussion, making you appear less demanding and potentially more agreeable to Bob.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing your potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
