"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to that.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go as low as $15,000. I'm willing to come down to $16,500 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle.  What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
