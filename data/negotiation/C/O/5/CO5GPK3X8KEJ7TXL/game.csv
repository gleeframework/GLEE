"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1400000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering my limit and the value I see in this unique item.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800000 is your budget, but I have to consider the value of the product as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's uniqueness and value. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1000000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my price range.  I'm firm on $850000.  This price allows for both of us to make a good deal. What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on $850000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $950000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,5,
