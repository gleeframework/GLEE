Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800000 is your budget, but I have to consider the value of the product as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's uniqueness and value. Let me know what you think.

While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit. I'll counter-offer again, aiming to stay closer to my initial offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on $850000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $950000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my budget.  While I could potentially counter-offer again, it's getting close to my limit and there's no guarantee of a better price.  It's better to secure the product for $800,000 from John to avoid further negotiations and potential delays."
