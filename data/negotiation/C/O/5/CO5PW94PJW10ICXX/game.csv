"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $95. It's getting closer. To make this work for me, I need to be at $105. Let's split the difference. It's a good price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95.  Let's finalize this deal.  It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,6,
