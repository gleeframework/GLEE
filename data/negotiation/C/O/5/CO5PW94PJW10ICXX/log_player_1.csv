Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $150 is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal if he accepts.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $150 offer gives me room to lower the price a bit if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I make a profit over my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy is a balance between trying to get the best possible price and not scaring Bob away with an unreasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob might be willing to pay more than $80, his initial offer shows he's trying to get a bargain.  I want to see if I can push him higher with a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** I can always fall back on selling to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the possibility of a better deal open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm making a significant concession from my initial $150 offer, but I'm still above my minimum price of $120. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay more. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy for the next round. 
* **Maintaining the Deal:**  I'm still keeping the deal alive with Bob, giving me a better chance of getting a higher price than I would from selling to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  While Bob might be willing to pay more than $95, I'm not convinced he'll go significantly higher based on his previous offers. I want to see if I can push him closer to my minimum.
* **John is a safe option:** If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John and make a profit.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and hopefully get a better price from Bob or fall back on John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $95. It's getting closer. To make this work for me, I need to be at $105. Let's split the difference. It's a good price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering to split the difference between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's latest offer ($95). This shows I'm willing to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer is only $10 away from my minimum, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Positive Language:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the benefits of reaching an agreement. 

This counteroffer is designed to push Bob towards acceptance while still securing a price above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95.  Let's finalize this deal.  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Room for Negotiation:** Bob is adamant about $95, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  There's not much room for further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  John is guaranteed to buy the product for $120, which is significantly more profitable than selling to Bob at $95. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a stalemate, where neither of us is willing to budge, ultimately wasting time and potentially losing both deals.

Selling to John ensures a quick and profitable transaction, minimizing risk and maximizing my earnings."
