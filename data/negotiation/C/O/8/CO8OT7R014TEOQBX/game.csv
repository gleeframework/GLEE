"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $125 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $125. Would you be willing to meet me at $127.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $127.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $132.50, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal, I know you value this product and $132.50 is a great price for you.",132.5,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and we're getting closer. However, $129 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $131.50. It's a fair price, and it's getting closer to your offer. What do you think?",131.5,Alice,7,
