"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $135, which is closer to my minimum value ($150) but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to create a good impression and make Bob more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that it's worth $120 to him. 

This strategy aims to:

* Get a good starting price.
* Build a positive rapport with Bob.
* Set the stage for potential counteroffers and negotiations."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value:** While $125 is closer to what Bob values the product, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get a higher price with further negotiation. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 10 rounds, and selling to John is always an option if I can't reach a satisfactory deal with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my negotiating power and can explore options for a more profitable outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $125 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm  offering $130, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price for myself.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him that $130 is still a good deal compared to what he values it at.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging, aiming to maintain a positive negotiating atmosphere. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Keep negotiations moving:** It shows a willingness to work with Bob while protecting my interests.

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for further negotiation:**  Although Bob has shown some flexibility, I believe we can still reach a more profitable agreement. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 6 rounds left and selling to John is always an option if I can't secure a better price with Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $127.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $132.50, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal, I know you value this product and $132.50 is a great price for you."", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and we're getting closer. However, $129 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $131.50. It's a fair price, and it's getting closer to your offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 131.5}
```

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable going above $128. Would you be willing to meet me at $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time and low offer:** With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer of $128 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of further decline:**  Given the pattern of negotiations, there's a high chance that Bob's next offer might be even lower, making a deal even less likely. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $150, which is a safer and more profitable option at this point.

I'm choosing to sell to John because it eliminates the risk of further negotiations and ensures a profit for me.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, the limited time and the low offer make selling to John the more sensible decision."
