"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit too high for me, I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000 for the product.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,500?  That would allow me to make the purchase comfortably.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,500 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value of the product for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $8,250 is very close, but I'm trying to stick to a hard limit.  If you'd be willing to come down to $8,000, I'd be able to close the deal right now.",8000.0,Bob,6,
