Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he has room to negotiate upwards.
* **It's below your value:** You value the product at $1,500,000, so you have room to negotiate downwards.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This price is neither too high nor too low, which makes it more likely for Bob to consider it.

This approach balances the need to earn as much as possible with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer.  If Bob rejects the offer, you can adjust your strategy based on his counteroffer and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my desired price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** You're not just sticking to your original price.
* **Offers a reasonable compromise:**  $1,150,000 is closer to Bob's offer, but still allows for some profit.
* **Keeps the pressure on Bob:** You're not accepting his offer outright, which might make him more willing to come up slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,150,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,075,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence but $1,075,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows continued willingness to negotiate:**  You're not giving up easily. 
* **Offers a slightly more appealing compromise:** You're meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and your previous offer.
* **Maintains your position:** You're not accepting his offer outright, which keeps the pressure on him to increase his bid.

You're now getting closer to your desired price, but you're also nearing your own personal line. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, you'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,050,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose a sale altogether.  John is offering a guaranteed profit, and that's the best outcome for me at this point."
