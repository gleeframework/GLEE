Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you attribute to it. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1500000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to my maximum budget of $1000000? I believe there might be room for compromise that could benefit both of us.
