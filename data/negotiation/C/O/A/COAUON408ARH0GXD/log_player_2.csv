# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is the closest I can get to meeting you halfway without losing money on the deal. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

While I could counter again, Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point. Accepting at $1,300,000 secures a $200,000 savings compared to John's offer."
