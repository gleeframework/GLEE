"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me. While I'm interested, $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $80. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $85, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? I think that would be fair for both of us.",82.5,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $82.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $83? It's a good middle ground, and I think we can both be happy with it.",83.0,Alice,5,
