"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to secure this unique opportunity. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1400000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
