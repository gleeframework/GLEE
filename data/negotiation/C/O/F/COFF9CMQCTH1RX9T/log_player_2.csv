"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum price point, it's worth trying to negotiate.  You have no information about the product's value to Alice, so there's a chance she'd be willing to accept a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to secure this unique opportunity. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1400000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,400,000, which is a good compromise.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she will reject your counteroffer, and you'll have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
