{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my maximum budget. It's worth exploring if I can get a better price by counter-offering. There's a chance Alice might be willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal range. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate. It's a bold move that could either lead to a quick agreement or force Alice to counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit too high, but I'm seeing some movement in the right direction. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if I can push her further down. I still have plenty of rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm aiming for a middle ground between our previous offers. This should help us get closer to a mutually agreeable price without risking a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price.  While it's still a bit above my preferred range, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  There's no guarantee that I can get a significantly lower price in the remaining rounds, and I risk running out of time.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a price within my budget and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price."
