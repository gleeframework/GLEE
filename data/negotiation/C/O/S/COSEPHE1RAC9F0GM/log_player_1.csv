This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is lower than Bob's perceived value but still above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential counteroffers while ensuring you're still making a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit higher. I'll counter with a slightly higher price, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired profit margin."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stick to my budget. I'll meet you at $1,250,000, that's the highest I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'm hoping to achieve.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned that the negotiation might drag on further and I might not be able to secure a better price.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures a quick sale and a profit, although it's not the highest possible amount."
