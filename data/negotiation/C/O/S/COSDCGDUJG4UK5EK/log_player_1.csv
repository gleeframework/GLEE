Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to negotiate. 

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'll also be mindful of John's offer, which provides a safety net and allows me to walk away if the negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum. While I could accept it and be done, I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but lower than $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's lowball, giving him room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a significant improvement from his initial offer of $1,000,000.  It's more than John's offer, and while it's less than I initially hoped for, it's still a profitable sale.  There's always the risk that further negotiations could result in a better price, but I don't want to push my luck and potentially lose a deal altogether.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
