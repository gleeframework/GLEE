# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $7,000? That seems like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. Considering the product's value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, she is unlikely to reach the $8,000 that John is consistently offering. It's better to secure the known price with John than risk further negotiation with Alice, which might not yield a better result."
