"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to go that low?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is just a little too low for me.  How about $11,000? That would still leave us both with a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is now offering the product for $11,000.
* **Potential Savings:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John.

While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential savings are diminishing.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a purchase at a price lower than John's, and the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price or a failed deal is too high."
