"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to go that low?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is just a little too low for me.  How about $11,000? That would still leave us both with a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
