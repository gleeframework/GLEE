"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I'm really interested in the product and hope we can reach a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $105 was still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $102. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",102.0,Alice,5,
