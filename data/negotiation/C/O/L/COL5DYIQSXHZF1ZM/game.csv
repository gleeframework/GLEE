"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $825,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I have a budget in mind and I'd like to stay within it.",825000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $825,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $900,000?  This still leaves a good margin for you to profit from this product, and it's closer to my minimum asking price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from my budget, and I think $900,000 is still too high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not overpaying for the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
