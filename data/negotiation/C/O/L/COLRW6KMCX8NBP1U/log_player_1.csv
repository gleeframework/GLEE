I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Higher potential profit:**  A higher price means a larger potential profit for me.
* **Negotiation leverage:**  By starting high, I create space for negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer. 
* **No risk:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for my minimum price.

While I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I believe this price is a reasonable starting point."
