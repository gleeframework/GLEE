Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $16,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $16,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $12,000 is closer to my budget, I can't go that high right now. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,000, hoping we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $8,000 offer.  It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his offer would result in a $4,000 loss compared to John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
