,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $8500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8500 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8750.  That would be a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a decent profit.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8600.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",8600.0,Bob,4,
