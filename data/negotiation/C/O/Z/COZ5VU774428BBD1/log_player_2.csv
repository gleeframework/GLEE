"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $120 is still a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly. While it's a lowball offer, it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to appear interested while still setting a firm limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $90? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice meeting in the middle at $90 is a good deal. It's below our $80 ideal, but significantly less than her starting price and our alternative with John."
