Round 5

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, that price is still a bit too high for me.  I can offer $11,000.  This is a fair offer, considering I can always get it from John for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know this product is valuable to you, even if you're not quite willing to admit it yet.  You're right, you could go to John, but I'm offering you a chance to cut out the middleman.  My final offer is $14,000.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and seems unlikely to drop below $14,000. While her product might be worth slightly more than John's, the potential savings of $4,000 by going with John outweigh the uncertain benefits of Alice's product.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed savings."
