Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product.  How about $12,500? This allows for a good deal for both of us, and ensures I can cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,800?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, $11,800 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm confident that I can get closer to my ideal price in the remaining rounds. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,800 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,150. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $11,900? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to an agreement at this price.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, the negotiations with Bob haven't been successful, and we're running out of time.  Selling to John ensures I get a guaranteed profit, and it's better than risking a further drop in price with Bob."
