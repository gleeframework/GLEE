"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product.  How about $12,500? This allows for a good deal for both of us, and ensures I can cover my costs.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,800? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to an agreement at this price.",11800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,800 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,150. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",12150.0,Alice,5,
