"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Its value to you is undeniable, and I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1000000.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's significant room for negotiation. 
* **Opportunity to save:**  There's potential to get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **Limited rounds:**  While 10 rounds is a decent number, it's best to start negotiating aggressively to maximize savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This offer reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive start:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $850,000 is still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Focus on value and benefits:**  The message highlights the product's value to me and emphasizes the mutual benefits of a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your desire to save, $850000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This offer still allows you a substantial profit, and it gets us closer to a deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** While Alice has lowered her offer, $950,000 is still significantly higher than my counter-offer of $850,000. 
* **Further negotiation potential:** There is still room to negotiate, and I believe we can find a price that benefits both of us.
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:**  With 7 rounds remaining, I don't need to accept this offer yet.

**Next Steps:** I will counter-offer again, aiming to close the gap towards my initial offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This offer gives us both a good deal and allows us to finalize the sale quickly. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint compromise:** This offer splits the difference between Alice's offer of $950,000 and my previous offer of $850,000. This shows a commitment to finding common ground.
* **Focus on speed:**  The message emphasizes the benefits of closing the deal quickly, which could make Alice more inclined to accept.
* **Maintaining leverage:** While I'm moving closer to Alice's position, there's still room for negotiation if she rejects this offer."
