"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Its value to you is undeniable, and I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1000000.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1000000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This offer reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can close this quickly.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your desire to save, $850000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This offer still allows you a substantial profit, and it gets us closer to a deal. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $900000? This offer gives us both a good deal and allows us to finalize the sale quickly. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
