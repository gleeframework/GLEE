"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you offered is considerably lower than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the true worth of this product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still outside my price range.  Let's try $950,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and is closer to what I can realistically afford.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While I'm motivated to sell, I must be realistic about the product's value.  My final offer is $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and a fair deal for a product you won't find elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
