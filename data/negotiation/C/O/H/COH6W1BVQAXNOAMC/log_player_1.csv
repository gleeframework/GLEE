Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $13,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, meaning he has a potential surplus of $7,000 ($15,000 - $8,000).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to capture as much of that surplus as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $13,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $8,000.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
