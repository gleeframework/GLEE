Round 2
Bob's offer:

We're getting into dangerous territory for me to accept, as each counteroffer is getting closer to John's offer.  I'll counter one more time to try and hold a line above $1,300,000."

Bob is very unlikely to move significantly above $1,320,000.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
