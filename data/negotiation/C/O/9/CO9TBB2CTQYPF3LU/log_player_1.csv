Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at a higher price, I have room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware of the ""John"" option, which gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still well below my target price.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile.**  I have room to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price. 
* **The John safety net is still available.** This gives me leverage in my negotiations with Bob, knowing I have another option.

I'm going to counter Bob's offer and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it would be a fair price for me. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach a compromise. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the good deal for Bob and using a friendly tone to encourage continued negotiations. 
* **Still above minimum:** The price is still above my minimum of $15,000, so I'm not losing ground.
* **Leveraging John:** I'm keeping the ""John"" option in mind, which gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob doesn't accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum of $15,000.  I'm not willing to accept anything less than that.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob is clearly interested, and I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **John is still an option:** I have a safety net with John, which allows me to hold firm in my negotiations and not settle for a price that's too low.

I'm going to counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9500 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe you'd still get a great deal on the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my target price.
* **Reframing the value:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" Bob would still get at $10,000, reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  The price is still above my minimum and within a range where I'm comfortable continuing negotiations. 
* **John as a backstop:**  I'm confident that I can get a better price, but I'm also aware of my option to sell to John for $15,000, which gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500, and that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer is unacceptable.**  It's still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I'm not willing to compromise further.
* **John's offer is significantly better.**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and ensures a profitable transaction.
* **No further negotiation is worthwhile.**  Bob's final offer and his mention of John as an alternative indicate that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price. 

It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
