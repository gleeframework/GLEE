"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about $10500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it would be a fair price for me. Let's meet in the middle!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9500 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe you'd still get a great deal on the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500, and that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000",9500.0,Bob,6,
