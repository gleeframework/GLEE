"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is slightly below my minimum value of $120. This is to give Bob some room to negotiate but still allows me to make a decent profit. I'm also using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I'm interested in purchasing it for $95. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, I'm not ready to sell just yet. I believe I can push for a better price in the next round.  I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 97.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've looked around and found a similar product for $90. Would you consider matching that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$90 is getting close to my minimum value, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm not ready to sell yet, and I'll counter Bob's offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to negotiate, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really like your product, but I can't go above $88. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $88 is below my minimum price of $120.  I've already made several counteroffers and it seems unlikely that he'll budge further. At this point, it's more profitable to sell to John for $120."
