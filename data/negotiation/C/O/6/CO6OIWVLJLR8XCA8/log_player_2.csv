# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You can potentially get a better deal with Alice, and even if you don't, you can always fall back on buying from John."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This price still offers a significant profit for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking to receive. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
