"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  It's important to start high to maximize potential profits.  I'll be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $18,000 is a good offer, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can get closer to my target. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that Bob will find this price acceptable and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $17,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to counter Bob's offer again and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,500. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise. If Bob is serious about buying, I'm hopeful that he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although $17,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher offer.  It's risky to go much lower, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to budge.  If he rejects again, I'll sell to John for $15,000 to guarantee a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm going to meet Bob halfway at $17,500. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I don't have enough time to get Bob to budge further.  It's better to guarantee the sale to John for $15,000.  While it's not ideal, it's still above my minimum acceptable price and I'll avoid the risk of getting nothing at all if the negotiations continue to stall."
