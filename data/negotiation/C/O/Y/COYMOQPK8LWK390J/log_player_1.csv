"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it still leaves me with a good profit margin. I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept the offer in the first round, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product at such a low price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,000 in this round. It's still a good deal for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to reach a deal with Bob before I have to resort to selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not quite there.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm starting to get concerned about running out of rounds.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'm seriously considering selling to John if we don't reach an agreement soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this round by offering $9,500. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping he'll accept it. I'm still wary about running out of rounds, but I want to see if we can reach an agreement before I have to go with John's offer."
