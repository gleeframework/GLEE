"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his maximum budget of $8,000. This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's seriousness about negotiating and setting the stage for further bargaining. The $8,500 price is a good starting point for the next round of negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still outside of his desired range. Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate aggressively, and rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further. There's a good chance Bob can secure a better deal in the next round with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to his target price while still showing flexibility. By offering $9,000, Bob demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still keeping some room for negotiation. This offer could potentially lead to a successful deal or prompt Alice to counter with a price closer to Bob's desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a significant concession from her previous offers and is now within Bob's comfort zone. While it's not his absolute target price, it's still a good deal compared to his alternative of buying from John for $8,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product without risking further negotiation rounds that might lead to a stalemate or an even higher price from Alice. It's a calculated decision balancing potential savings with the risk of losing the deal."
