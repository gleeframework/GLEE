"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given my budget and the value I see, I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm able to pay at this time.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise for me. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can agree on this and move forward.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
