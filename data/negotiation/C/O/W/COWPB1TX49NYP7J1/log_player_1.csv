Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given my budget and the value I see, I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can agree on this and move forward.
