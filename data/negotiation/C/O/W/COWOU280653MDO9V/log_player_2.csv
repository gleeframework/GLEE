Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $650000 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $670000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $670,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $670,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly from the initial offer.  While $670,000 is more than you'd like to pay, it's still a significant savings compared to buying from John.  It's also likely that further negotiation might not result in a much lower price.  With only a few rounds left, accepting the offer ensures you get the product and saves you a substantial amount of money."
