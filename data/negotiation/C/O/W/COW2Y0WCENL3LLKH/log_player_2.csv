"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $9,500, which is less than your maximum price but still more than you would like to pay. 
* You can get the product from John for $10,000. 
* Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves you $500 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
