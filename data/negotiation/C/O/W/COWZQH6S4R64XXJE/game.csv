"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I do see its value, I'm not quite ready to go that high.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This price is still a good deal for you and leaves room for us both to be happy with the outcome.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to make a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $900,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",875000.0,Alice,3,
