"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice since you can potentially save $100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I do see its value, I'm not quite ready to go that high.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This price is still a good deal for you and leaves room for us both to be happy with the outcome.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to make a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $900,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get the price lower, Alice has come down significantly, and at this point, it's more advantageous to accept her offer and save $125,000 compared to buying from John."
