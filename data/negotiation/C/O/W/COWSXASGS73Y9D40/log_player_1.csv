Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is higher than my minimum, but I want to see if I can get a good price from Bob. If he rejects, I can always lower the price or sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my ideal price, but I'm also showing flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $175, $160 is still a good price and above my minimum.  It's not worth risking losing the sale and only getting $150 from John."
