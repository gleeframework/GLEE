Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you seem quite set on this product which is great! I want to see us make a deal here. To be fair, $11,500 is cutting it close to my minimum. How about we split the difference and do $12,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while there might be a small amount of room left to negotiate, $12,000 is a reasonable price. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to pay John $15,000."
