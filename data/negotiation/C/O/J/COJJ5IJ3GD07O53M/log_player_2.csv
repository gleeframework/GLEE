"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,600,000. It's worth at least that much to me, but I'm willing to make a deal for a slightly higher price to ensure your satisfaction. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise I'll be selling it to John for $1,500,000.  This is a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be a great investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is bluffing. You know John will sell the product to you for $1,500,000, and Alice knows you know this. She's trying to get a higher price, but it's not in your best interest to accept."
