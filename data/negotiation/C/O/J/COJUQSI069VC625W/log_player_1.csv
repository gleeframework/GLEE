Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This reflects the maximum value I see for the product, and I'm confident it's a fair starting point for further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
