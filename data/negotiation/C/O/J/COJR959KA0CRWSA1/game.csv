"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your starting point, I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $675,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still aiming to be closer to $650,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $662,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",662500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go up to $662,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $680,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",680000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see your point, but I'm still trying to reach a number that works for both of us. How about $670,000? It's just a little more than my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",670000.0,Bob,6,
