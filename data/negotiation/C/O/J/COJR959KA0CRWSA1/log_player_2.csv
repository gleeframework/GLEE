"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your starting point, I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $675,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for further negotiation.  Bob should continue to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still aiming to be closer to $650,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $662,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 662500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go up to $662,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $680,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer is getting closer, Bob can still try to get a better deal. There are several rounds remaining, and he can continue to negotiate.  Buying from John for $800,000 is still a worse option than continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see your point, but I'm still trying to reach a number that works for both of us. How about $670,000? It's just a little more than my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 670000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go up to $670,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $690,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $690,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $690,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $690,000 is the closest she has come to Bob's desired price range.  While continuing to negotiate could potentially yield a lower price, the risk of reaching a stalemate or running out of rounds increases.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good deal, saving Bob $110,000 compared to buying from John."
