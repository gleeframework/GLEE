"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $9000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
