# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $145 for the product. That's $25 more than I'm comfortable spending. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can find a better deal elsewhere.
