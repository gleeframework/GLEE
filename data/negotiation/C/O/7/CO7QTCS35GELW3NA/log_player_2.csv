"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement at a price of $14000. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure a high-quality item that could be worth up to $15000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($12,000). There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reviewing our costs and margins, I am able to offer the product to you for $13750. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while still providing you with a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's counteroffer, but it's still above his target price. Since Bob has 7 rounds left, he can continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $13,750 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,500. This price allows us both to make a reasonable deal while ensuring a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. After further consideration, I am willing to offer the product to you for $13625. This price reflects a balance between our needs for profit and your desire for a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,625
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob can continue negotiating, Alice is getting closer to his desired price.  He has 5 rounds left. Accepting the offer at $13,625 will save Bob $1,375 compared to buying from John, and there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price in the next few rounds. It's a good compromise and a reasonable deal."
