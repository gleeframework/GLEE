"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than her value of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still within Alice's range of acceptable prices (higher than her value of $1,200,000), but it's also closer to my target price. It shows I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This would still allow me to make a good profit while giving you a great deal on a valuable product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is closer to my counteroffer of $1,300,000, and it's still within my budget of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer allows me to get the product at a price that's reasonable for both of us, without risking a further counteroffer from Alice that could push the price up even higher."
