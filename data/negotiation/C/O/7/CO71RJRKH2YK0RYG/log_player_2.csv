"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a profit. How about we meet at $1,080,000? It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,080,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get Alice down to my target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I can see you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to make one final concession. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $1,090,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,090,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. I've already made multiple counteroffers, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to budge further. To avoid further negotiation and potential for an even higher price, I'll go ahead and purchase the product from John for $1,200,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still within my budget and ensures I acquire the product."
