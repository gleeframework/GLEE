"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $9,000. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit hesitant on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
