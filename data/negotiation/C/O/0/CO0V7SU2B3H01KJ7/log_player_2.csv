Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but $10000 simply isn't enough for this product. It's truly unique and offers significant value. How about we split the difference and go with $12500? It's a fair price that still allows for some wiggle room for both of us.
