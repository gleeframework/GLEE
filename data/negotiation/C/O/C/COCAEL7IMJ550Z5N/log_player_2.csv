"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $10000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,500.** This is a better price than John's offer of $10,000.
* **You value the product at $10,000.** This means you're willing to pay up to $10,000 for it.
* **Accepting Alice's offer saves you $500** compared to buying from John.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save money."
