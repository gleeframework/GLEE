{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. I think that's a fair price for this incredible product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still not at a point where I'd be happy to accept. I'll try to negotiate further and see if we can land on a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000, but I'm still looking for a bit more room to make this work.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.   What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This product is worth every penny to me, and I'm not willing to give it away. Let's see if we can shake on it at $920,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I could try to push for a bit lower, the risk of her rejecting my offer and ultimately buying from John for $1,200,000 outweighs the potential of saving an additional $20,000.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing out completely."
