"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $8250?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
