Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $10,500? That's a fair price considering the product's value, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if you're interested.
