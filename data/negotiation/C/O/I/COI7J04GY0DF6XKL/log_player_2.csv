"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate it,  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget of $8,000.  Since Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to go with the guaranteed lower price. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a price lower than $8,000, and Bob doesn't want to risk losing the product to another buyer."
