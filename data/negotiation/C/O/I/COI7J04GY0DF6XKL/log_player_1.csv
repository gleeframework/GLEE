{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also allows you to gauge Bob's interest level before potentially moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate it,  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $8,500 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
