"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That seems fair considering the product's value and my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
