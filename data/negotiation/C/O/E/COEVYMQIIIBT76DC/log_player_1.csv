Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have 9 rounds left and can still get a better deal, or go with John if necessary."

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing this sale by trying to negotiate further."
