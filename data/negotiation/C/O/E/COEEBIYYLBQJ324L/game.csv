"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can meet you halfway at $11,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000. I can do $10,500, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and close the deal at $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not quite there. I can meet you at $10,750, which is the closest I can get to your last offer. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",10750.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I'm willing to offer $10,400 to finalize the deal. This is a fair offer considering the value and my budget.",10400.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see we're really close. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,600? This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",10600.0,Alice,9,
