"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to the price I'm looking to pay. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. The product is worth $12,000 to him, and I can still potentially reach a middle ground.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find common ground. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,750. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. He clearly values the product higher than $10,750, so there's room for further negotiation. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to land closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'll offer $10,875. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'll meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,687.50. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,687.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,687.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still think there's potential to get closer to my target price.  I've already conceded significantly, and I'm confident I can push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit uncomfortable with $10,687.50.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. I'll offer $10,781.25. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10781.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'll meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,750.62. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750.62. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750.62
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still a bit too low for me. With only two rounds left, I don't have enough time to push for a higher price and risk losing the deal altogether. Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a decent profit, and it's safer than risking a further drop in price with Bob."
