"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm not going to sell the product for $850,000. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or John.  I'll counter Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm offering $950,000. This reflects the value of the product while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more manageable. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm sticking with $950,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal, I'm confident it will be a good investment for you."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've been considering my options carefully, and to be completely transparent, I've found a similar product elsewhere for a price that's hard to ignore. I'm still very interested in your product, but I'd need it to be closer to $925,000 to justify going with it. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, John is offering a guaranteed $1,200,000. I'm going to sell to John."
