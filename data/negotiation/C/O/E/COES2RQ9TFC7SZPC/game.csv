"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm offering $950,000. This reflects the value of the product while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more manageable. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm sticking with $950,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal, I'm confident it will be a good investment for you.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've been considering my options carefully, and to be completely transparent, I've found a similar product elsewhere for a price that's hard to ignore. I'm still very interested in your product, but I'd need it to be closer to $925,000 to justify going with it. This is my final offer.",925000.0,Bob,6,
