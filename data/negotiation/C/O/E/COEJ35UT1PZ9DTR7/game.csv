"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? This offer still saves you a significant amount compared to its true value.",9750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,750 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
