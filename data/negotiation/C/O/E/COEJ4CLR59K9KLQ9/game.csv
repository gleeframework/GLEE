"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,500 is a bit high for me. I'm happy to consider a price closer to $9,000, reflecting the value we both understand the product holds. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $9,500. This still reflects the high value of the product, while remaining competitive. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $9,250.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
