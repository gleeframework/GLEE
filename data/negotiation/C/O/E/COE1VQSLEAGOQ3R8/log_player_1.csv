{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly opening to build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a little too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's a significant discount from my original offer and still a fair price for a product of this quality.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? That's the highest I can go, and I really think this product would be a great fit for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good deal considering it's above his initial offer and closer to my desired price.  While I would love to get closer to my ideal price, I'm  not confident I can get a better offer from Bob and John is a guaranteed $15,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
