"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  your initial offer is a bit high for me. Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer you $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet halfway at $1,600,000?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still respecting my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

At this point, Bob is unlikely to offer a price that's significantly closer to my minimum. Accepting his offer of $1,400,000 would mean a loss of $100,000 compared to John's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
