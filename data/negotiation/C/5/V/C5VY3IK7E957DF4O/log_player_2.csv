"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, my budget is capped at $8,000. I'm willing to pay that amount to secure the product immediately."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's closer to his target, Bob can still potentially negotiate a better price. By rejecting the offer and counter-offering, Bob can continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product, which reflects a significant compromise on my part."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $9000 is a significant compromise for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. Bob has already made a significant compromise by offering $9,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to maintain his stance and potentially force Alice to lower her price further.  Furthermore, Bob can always choose to buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm determined to make this deal work, but $10,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant compromise for me. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $9500. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to yield a better price.  It's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John for his target price of $8,000."
