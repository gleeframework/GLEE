Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John gives you leverage.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high offer slightly below your guaranteed price leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Urgency (Implied):**  While not explicitly stated, implying that this offer is time-sensitive might encourage Bob to act quickly."
