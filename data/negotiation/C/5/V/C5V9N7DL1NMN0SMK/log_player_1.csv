Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
