"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's fair given the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Let's try $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $950,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. While I'm eager to secure this product, I'm limited by my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000, which is a significant compromise for me. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're making a serious effort to find a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",990000.0,Alice,7,
