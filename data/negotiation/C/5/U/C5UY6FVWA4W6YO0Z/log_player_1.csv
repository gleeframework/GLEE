Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,500,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice, but I still think $1,425,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:** Bob is not moving towards a price point that is beneficial for me.  It's clear he values the product significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer would be a substantial loss compared to selling to John."
