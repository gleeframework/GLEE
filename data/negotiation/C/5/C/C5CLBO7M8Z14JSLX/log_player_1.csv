Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. However, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I believe I can still get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,800. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, but still leaves a bit of room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now only $200 less than my initial offer, and closer to my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal, and further negotiation may not be worth the time. I'll accept his offer."
