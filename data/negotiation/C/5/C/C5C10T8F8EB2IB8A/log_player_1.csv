Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? "",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Can you think about $9,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $9,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Explanation:  Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his initial lowball offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will get us significantly closer to our desired price.  Selling to John for $10,000 is a sure thing and avoids the risk of Bob's low offers continuing."
