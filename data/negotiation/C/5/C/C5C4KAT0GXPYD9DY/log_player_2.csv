"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $14,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation and gauge her flexibility.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful while clearly stating my desired price. 
* **Not Too Low:**  While aiming for a good deal, offering a price too close to Alice's value ($12,000) might be seen as unreasonable and stall negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Room:** Alice moved down in price, which is positive, but $13,500 is still a considerable distance from my target price. 
* **Time for Concessions:**  It's early in the negotiation, and I want to see if I can get Alice closer to the $12,000 mark before accepting.
* **John as Backup:** I'm still comfortable knowing I have John's $15,000 offer as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  How about we settle at $12,250? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 12250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's roughly in the middle of our last two offers, signaling a willingness to negotiate but also standing my ground.
* **Close to Alice's Value:** Offering slightly above Alice's known value ($12,000) increases the likelihood of her accepting, as it represents a small profit for her.
* **Strategic Timing:** It's still early enough in the negotiation to make a slightly higher counteroffer, while we have time for potential further adjustments."
