"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a bit high. There's room to negotiate a lower price, getting closer to Alice's value of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Could you do any better?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By offering $110, we're anchoring the negotiation closer to Alice's perceived value ($120). This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is phrased to express interest but also convey that we're looking for a better deal. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer helps gauge Alice's flexibility and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $125, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer and is now very close to her known value of $120.  

* **Good Deal:** $125 is a solid price, saving you $25 compared to John's offer.
* **Risk of Pushing Further:**  While we might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, there's a risk that Alice will walk away if we counter too aggressively. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and effort. Accepting now secures a good deal without further hassle."
