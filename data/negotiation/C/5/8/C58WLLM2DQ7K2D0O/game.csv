,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $125 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $112.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again at $110. Let's make this happen.",110.0,Bob,6,
