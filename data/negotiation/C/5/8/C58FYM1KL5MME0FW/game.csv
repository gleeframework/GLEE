"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than my budget.  How about $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",125.0,Alice,3,
