"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I think $107 is still a bit low for me. I can meet you at $112, but that's my final offer. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is signaling this is her final offer.  While you could push further, the savings are likely minimal and you risk her accepting another offer.  $112 is a reasonable compromise and significantly cheaper than John's offer."
