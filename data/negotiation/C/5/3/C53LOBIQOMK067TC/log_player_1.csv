Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $125. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $125 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob, allowing us to potentially settle on a price higher than $80.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, we're secure knowing John will purchase it for our minimum acceptable price of $150."
