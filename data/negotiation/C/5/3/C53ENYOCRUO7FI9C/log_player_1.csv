"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** The offer is strategically placed closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) than to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and avoids any language that might seem desperate or overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a bit high at $1,150,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below both my asking price and the product's value to him. Accepting this would leave a lot of money on the table. While his message suggests a willingness to negotiate, I'm confident I can secure a better deal by countering and continuing the negotiation. I'm not yet ready to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value and the benefits it offers. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,075,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial concession from my initial offer ($1,150,000 to $1,075,000), signaling to Bob that I'm flexible and want to make a deal.
* **Above Reserve:** The counteroffer remains comfortably above my absolute minimum ($1,000,000), giving me room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  I've re-emphasized the product's value to justify my price and avoid appearing solely focused on profit.
* **Collaborative Tone:** The language emphasizes finding a ""middle ground"" and a ""fair deal,"" fostering a collaborative atmosphere for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe the product is valuable, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still in a good position to negotiate further. He's acknowledging the product's value and expressing a desire to find a solution, indicating he's willing to pay more. Selling to John at $1,000,000 is a tempting backup, but I believe I can still secure a better deal with Bob within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate that you're working with me on the price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product will bring you while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** This time, I'm making a smaller concession ($50,000 instead of $75,000), signaling that I'm nearing my bottom line. 
* **Reinforcing Value:** I continue to emphasize the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll receive. 
* **Seeking Agreement:** The tone remains collaborative, emphasizing finding a solution that works for both parties. This encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer.
* **Time Consideration:**  We are now past the halfway point of the negotiations, and I need to steer Bob closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $925,000. I believe this price reflects the value I'll get from the product, and it's within my budget. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer increments are too small, and he seems stuck at a price point significantly below my target. With only four rounds left, it's unlikely he'll reach a number I find acceptable.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk Bob walking away or running out the clock."
