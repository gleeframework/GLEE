"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to save as much money as I can. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is still a great deal for a product worth $10000 to you.  Let's find a middle ground here.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $8750. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you can accept it.",8750.0,Bob,4,
