Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for something closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $17,000 is close enough to my desired price point that I'm willing to accept it. While I'd prefer more, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower offer, or even losing the deal entirely, is not worth it."
