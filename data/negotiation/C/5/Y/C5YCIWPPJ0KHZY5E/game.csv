"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $975,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
