Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

This offer aims to maximize profit while still leaving some room for negotiation. Here's the reasoning:

* **$15,000 is the minimum:** I know I can get at least this much from John. 
* **$18,000 is a reasonable starting point:** It's a significant increase over my minimum, but not so high that it immediately seems unreasonable.  
* **Negotiation is expected:**  I'm anticipating Bob might counter-offer, and this allows for some flexibility in the negotiation. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
