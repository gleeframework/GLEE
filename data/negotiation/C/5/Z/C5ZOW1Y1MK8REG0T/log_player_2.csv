"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price of $11000. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $11,000 is above your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can likely get a better price by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a backup option:**  Knowing you can buy from John for $12,000 gives you leverage in negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget.  How about $10,500?  That's the highest I can go at this time."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $10800? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your desired price:** While $10,800 is closer to your budget, you're still hoping to pay less.
* **You have room to negotiate further:** You can likely push for a lower price by making another counteroffer.
* **John is still a backup:**  His offer gives you confidence to push for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,800 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,600.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10600} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10600. How about we take it up to $10900? That's as close as I can get for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is pushing the price up:** Alice's counteroffer of $10,900 is higher than your previous offer of $10,600. 
* **Limited negotiation rounds:**  We're already in round 5, and you only have 5 rounds left.  
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  While you'd like to pay less, John's offer of $12,000 is within your budget and guarantees you the product. 

It's a better strategy to secure the product from John at this point to avoid risking further negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up with a higher price."
