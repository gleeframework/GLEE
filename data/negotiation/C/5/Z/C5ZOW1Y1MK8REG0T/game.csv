"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $11000 is a bit above my budget.  How about $10500?  That's the highest I can go at this time.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $10800?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10800 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10600.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10600. How about we take it up to $10900? That's as close as I can get for now.",10900.0,Alice,5,
