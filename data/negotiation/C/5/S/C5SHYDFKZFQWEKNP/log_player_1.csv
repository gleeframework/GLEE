I'm making a small concession, bringing the price down to $875,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, while still trying to secure a price closer to my target. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a little in his next counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

With only three rounds left, the negotiation is getting tight.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out completely.  It's time to accept John's offer, securing a sale and preventing a potential breakdown with Bob.  While it's not my ideal price, it's better than risking a complete loss."
