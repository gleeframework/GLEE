"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still within the realm of possibility if Bob values the product highly.  This will give me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a higher price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but not by too much. This shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but I'm still confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only slightly higher than his previous offer. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, so I'll reject and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still maintaining a margin above my minimum.  Bob seems to be holding firm on his price, so I need to find a middle ground we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offers and is very close to my desired price. While I could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and ultimately selling to John for $10,000 is too high. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
