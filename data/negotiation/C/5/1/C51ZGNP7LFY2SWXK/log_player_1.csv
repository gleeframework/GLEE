"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. This will give me room to negotiate if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $112 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm hoping to get closer to $120 with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $112 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference this time and go with $113. That's a good deal for both of us, and we can close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 113}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $111? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm not thrilled about not getting more than my minimum price, I've reached a point where I'm concerned that I'll spend too much time negotiating with Bob and won't be able to get a better price.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
