Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is quite a bit higher than what I'm able to pay right now. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,725,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to go to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $1,562,500 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,400,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has shown he's unwilling to move significantly from his $1,400,000 offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option to ensure I receive my minimum acceptable price."
