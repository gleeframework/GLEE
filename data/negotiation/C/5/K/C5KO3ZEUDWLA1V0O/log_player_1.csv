Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate up while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning the offer is exclusive and time-sensitive, it might encourage Bob to act quickly."
