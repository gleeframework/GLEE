"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $700,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to you, you have a good chance of getting a better price by making a counteroffer.  It's unlikely Alice will immediately drop to your desired price, but by rejecting her offer, you start the negotiation process and can potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $650,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $700,000, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay.  I'm aiming to start the negotiation at a point where there's room for both of us to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $675,000, which is a good price considering my maximum is $800,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise, or that I might run out of rounds and have to buy from John for a higher price.  It's better to secure a good deal at this point."
