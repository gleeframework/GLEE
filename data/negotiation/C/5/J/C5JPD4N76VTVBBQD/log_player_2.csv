It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can potentially save $100,000."

I'm offering $750,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still within my budget. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also showcasing my seriousness about purchasing the product."

I'm offering Alice $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price for both of us, as it meets Alice's minimum and my budget. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll buy the product from John for the same price."
