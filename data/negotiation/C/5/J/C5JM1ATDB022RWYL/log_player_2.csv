"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm sure you'll see the potential it holds. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. You have no information on the true value of the product to Alice. There's no incentive to accept her offer since you can buy the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a better deal with Alice or find another seller with a lower price."
