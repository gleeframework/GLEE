"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value to me. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,250,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this price is still a good value for the product's worth to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. I'm confident this price allows you to make a reasonable profit while also allowing me to acquire this product. Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
