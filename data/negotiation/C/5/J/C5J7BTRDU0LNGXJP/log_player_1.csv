Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $110 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Being positive and enthusiastic:** A positive message might encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:**  Even though Bob knows the product's value, mentioning it in the message reinforces that it's a good deal. 

**Next steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and decide whether to:

* **Negotiate further:** If Bob counteroffers, I'll weigh his offer against the value to me and John's offer.
* **Accept his offer:** If Bob's offer is acceptable, I'll accept it.
* **Reject and make a counteroffer:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer, potentially moving closer to his offer. 
* **Sell to John:** If negotiations with Bob become too time-consuming or frustrating, or if he consistently offers a price below my minimum, I'll sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a better price:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding a quick sale:**  Selling to John immediately would be a safe choice, but I want to see if I can maximize my profits by negotiating further with Bob.

**Next steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll likely start with a price slightly higher than $90, giving myself room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $95?  That's still a great price for this amazing product, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to keep him engaged and motivated to reach an agreement.
* **Positive and friendly tone:**  A friendly approach might encourage Bob to accept the counteroffer.

**Next steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and then decide:

* **Accept his offer:** If he accepts my counteroffer, I'll be happy to sell the product for $95.
* **Make another counteroffer:** If he rejects my offer, I'll make a new counteroffer, likely lower than $95 but still higher than my minimum.
* **Sell to John:**  If negotiations continue to stall, or if Bob's offers consistently fall below my acceptable range, I'll sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $90, as that is closer to my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is at my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees a sale and avoids further negotiations.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away or offer a lower price, leaving me with nothing.
* **Time consideration:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming, and John's offer is always a safe fallback option.

**Next steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $90. This secures a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements and avoids further uncertainty in the negotiation."
