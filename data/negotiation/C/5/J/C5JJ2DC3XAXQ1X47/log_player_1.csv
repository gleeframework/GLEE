Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000,  trying to get a higher price from Bob first is worth a shot.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob. It's significantly less than John's offer and still a substantial profit for you (Alice).
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning another interested buyer creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly.

This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
