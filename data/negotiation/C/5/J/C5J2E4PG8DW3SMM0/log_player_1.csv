Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. This is still a good price for you, as it's below my initial asking price. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $97.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob.  I'm close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's unlikely he'll go much higher. To avoid risking getting stuck with a lower price, I'm going to sell to John for $120. It's the safest option to ensure I meet my minimum goal."
