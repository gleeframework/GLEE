"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be worth a maximum of $800,000 for my needs.  How about we start the negotiations around there? ",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can go up to $725,000, but that's my absolute limit.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",775000.0,Alice,5,
