"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $12000 at this time.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm looking for. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go to $13500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm not willing to go as low as $13500, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'm counteroffering at $14750. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and my minimum price. What do you think?",14750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $14750 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm offering $14000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and both of our positions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $16200. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16200.0,Alice,7,
