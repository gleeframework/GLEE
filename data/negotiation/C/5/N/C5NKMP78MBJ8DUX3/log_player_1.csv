"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but well below my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take it, I'm going to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $85 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to sell to someone else."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm  meeting Bob halfway with a price closer to his perceived value, but still above my minimum.  I'm also putting pressure on him by mentioning the other buyer."
