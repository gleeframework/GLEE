"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet halfway.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I see where you're coming from, Alice. How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours? Would $7,750 work for you?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,750 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $8,250,  which reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal and move on.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $8,000 even? That's a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
