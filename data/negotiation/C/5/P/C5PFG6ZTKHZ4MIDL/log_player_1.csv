Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a reasonable markup on my minimum price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will be interested in purchasing the product as it's worth $800,000 to him.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can do better with some negotiation.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm offering $875,000. This is a compromise,  meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. I'm hopeful this will be a good compromise for both of us, but I'm still prepared to walk away if he's not willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Bob seems pretty firm on his $850,000 offer. While I would prefer a higher price, it's not worth risking another round of negotiations.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a good profit, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000."
