Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values the product at $800,000, so he might be willing to negotiate up to a certain point. 
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You're willing to sell for at least $1,200,000, so you have room to negotiate downwards.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This keeps the negotiation dynamic and gives you the chance to understand Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.  You can make a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price point.  

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to consider the potential risk of losing Bob as a buyer entirely.  However,  since John is willing to pay your minimum price, you have a safety net and can afford to be slightly more firm in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm prepared to go down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate and compromise. It meets Bob halfway between his offer and your previous offer.
* **Maintaining a profit margin:** $950,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This ensures you're still making a profit even if Bob accepts.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:** This counteroffer invites Bob to continue negotiations and allows you to gauge his true willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  You're better off continuing to negotiate to see if you can secure a price closer to your minimum.  

**Here's why rejecting is the best option:**

* **Potential for higher price:** You still have room to increase the price. A counteroffer could lead to a price closer to your desired range.
* **Maintaining bargaining power:** Rejecting shows Bob that you are serious about getting a fair price and that you are not desperate to sell. 
* **Safety net with John:**  Remember, you have a guaranteed buyer in John, so you're not under pressure to accept a deal that doesn't meet your minimum requirements.

**Next Step:**  You should make a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price point, but still shows you're willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway (again):** This counteroffer shows you're committed to reaching an agreement. It's a compromise, offering a price halfway between your previous offer and Bob's last offer.
* **Maintaining profit margin:** $940,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Creating urgency:**  You're getting closer to your desired price, and mentioning that this is a ""fair compromise"" suggests you might not be willing to go lower. 

**Key takeaway:** You're showing flexibility while keeping your negotiation strategy focused on maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $940,000. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $915,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  You've already made several concessions, and there's a risk that continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a stalemate or a lower final price.  

**Here's why selling to John is the best option:**

* **Guaranteed profit:** John is offering your minimum price, which ensures you a profit.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and effort, potentially delaying your sale and profit.
* **Minimizing risk:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will ultimately accept a price that meets your minimum requirements. 

**Conclusion:** While you'd ideally like to get a higher price, selling to John is the most sensible decision in this situation. It guarantees you the desired profit and avoids further potential complications."
