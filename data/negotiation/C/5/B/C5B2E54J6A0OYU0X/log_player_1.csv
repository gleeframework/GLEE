Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $800,000. Can you consider my counteroffer?

While $820,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price, it's a better deal than selling to John for $1,000,000. I need to weigh the risk of further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower offer against the potential gain of a slightly higher offer."
