# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its significant worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to secure the product from John for a significantly lower price of $1,000,000."
