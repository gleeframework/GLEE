Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its significant worth."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My primary goal is to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so offering it below this price is not strategic.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John at my desired price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale."
