"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking $95. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  $90 is a good deal, but you can probably get it for less."
