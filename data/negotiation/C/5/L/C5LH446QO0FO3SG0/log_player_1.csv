Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While Bob only values the product at $100, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Appearing reasonable:**  Offering a price of $125 makes it seem like you're already giving a discount, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Alternative buyer:**  You have the security of John as a backup buyer at your minimum price, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Outcome:**

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob. If he accepts, you earn a profit above your minimum. If he rejects, you still sell the product to John for your desired amount."
