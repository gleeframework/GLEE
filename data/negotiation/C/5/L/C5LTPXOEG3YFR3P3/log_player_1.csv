Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115 for it."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later.
* **Targeting Bob's Value:** We know the product is worth $120 to Bob. By starting at $115, we aim to capture a significant portion of the value he places on it. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 price point leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down a bit, while still ensuring a good profit for Alice. 
* **Backup Plan:** It's important to remember that Alice has John as a backup buyer. This gives her leverage in the negotiation, as she doesn't *have* to sell to Bob if she's not happy with the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $100 matches Alice's minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than both her initial asking price and the product's value to Bob.  Rejecting this offer allows Alice to:

* **Signal Flexibility:** By rejecting the offer, but not immediately selling to John, Alice shows a willingness to negotiate further.
* **Aim Higher:** There's a good chance Bob is willing to pay more than $100. Rejecting this offer keeps the door open for a higher counteroffer. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Alice still has John as a guaranteed buyer at $100. This means she's not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $108? That's a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 108
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This classic negotiation tactic often feels fair to both parties. It shows a willingness to compromise from Alice's side.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $108 is still a significant profit margin for Alice above her minimum ($100) and leaves Bob with some perceived savings.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge how much more Bob might be willing to pay.  If he rejects this, Alice can feel more comfortable accepting John's $100 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $105 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Bob's offer of $105 provides Alice with a $5 profit, which is a reasonable outcome. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While Alice could try to negotiate further, the potential gains are small. Pushing too hard could risk Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal quickly means Alice can move on to other things. The additional $3 she *might* get from a protracted negotiation isn't worth the time and effort."
