"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item holds immense value for us, but considering its significance to you, we're confident it would be a perfect fit. We're offering this exceptional piece to you at a special price of $10,000. We believe this offers a fair balance between the worth you see in it and the value we place on it. Please let us know if this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, you know you have a backup option with John. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead to a counter-offer at a lower price, potentially closer to her $8,000 value. It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal."
