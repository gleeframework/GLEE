"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can work something out.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I could maybe do $95.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",110.0,Alice,5,
