"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and agree on $11,000? I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
