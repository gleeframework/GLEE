"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
