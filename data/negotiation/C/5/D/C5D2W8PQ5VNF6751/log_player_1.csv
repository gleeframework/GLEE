"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below what I know the product is worth to Bob. This allows for some room to negotiate, while still giving me a good profit. I also want to emphasize the value of the product to Bob in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your product's value and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $13500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still above my minimum threshold of $10,000, but it's below what I initially aimed for. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $13,750.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $13600. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, and it's still significantly above my minimum threshold and the price John is offering. It's worth accepting to avoid risking losing the deal entirely and having to settle for John's offer."
