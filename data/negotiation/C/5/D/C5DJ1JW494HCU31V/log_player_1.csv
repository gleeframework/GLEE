Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is far beyond my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is my maximum offer.  Let me know if this works for you.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  While I understand the product's value, I can't go above my initial offer of $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to move forward if it's acceptable to you.

Bob is firm at $1,000,000 and unwilling to budge. It's clear that continuing negotiations with him will likely be fruitless. Accepting his offer means a significant loss compared to John's offer.  It's more profitable to cut our losses and sell to John."
