"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I would like to propose an alternative. Instead of purchasing the product outright, we could explore a payment plan over a period of six months with a down payment of $5000 and monthly installments of $1000. This way, you can acquire the product without straining your budget too much.",6000.0,Alice,3,,True

"Alice, thanks for offering the payment plan. I appreciate the flexibility. However, I'm still looking for a lower upfront price. I'm happy to pay $8000 for the product in one payment.  This would allow me to avoid any interest costs and keep my budget manageable. Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that.",8000.0,Bob,4,,

"Thank you for considering my proposal, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of my position. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a one-time payment of $7500 for the product. This is a significant discount from the original price, while still allowing you to benefit from the product's features without a lengthy payment plan. I hope this proposal meets your expectations.",7500.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7500 is getting closer, but my budget still doesn't allow for that. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product, a price that allows me to acquire it while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement on that.",7000.0,Bob,6,,
