Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It allows for potential profit while still being reasonable.

This strategy allows you to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Does he counter with a lower offer or immediately accept?
* **Maintain leverage:** You can always walk away and sell to John for your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I could do $900,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum and far from the $1,100,000 you initially offered. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
