"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum threshold but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is tempting, it's below my minimum threshold. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm offering $8,500. This is still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer, indicating a willingness to compromise while also maintaining a fair price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly my minimum threshold.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
