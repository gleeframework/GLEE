"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first.  You can likely get a better price than $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $7,500 is still a good deal for both of us, and it leaves room for some back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still hoping to get a lower price, and $8,500 is still a little high.  I'll try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

Since Alice has come down from $9,000 to $8,500, I'm going to try and meet her halfway with an offer of $8,000. This is my maximum, and if she rejects it, I can always go to John."
