$11,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can offer you the product for $10500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

While $10,500 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. Since you can buy the product from John for $8,000, it's better to cut your losses and go with that option."
