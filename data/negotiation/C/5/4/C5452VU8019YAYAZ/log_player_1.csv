Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, as John acts as a guaranteed backup buyer at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I want a price close to my minimum, starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, maybe offering $140, which is still a great profit for me. 
* **High Initial Offer:**  Since I have a backup buyer, I'm not desperate. A high initial offer tests Bob's interest and might make him think the product is worth more. 
 
**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob outright rejects $149. However, since there's no negotiation round in this scenario, I'm banking on securing a price close to my minimum acceptable price."
