Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, considering I can get it elsewhere for $8,000. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. It's a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $8,000 from John.  He should counter-offer Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact I have other options. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11000 might still be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $10500. It's a great compromise, considering the product's value and your previous offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm  prepared to pay $9,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good deal for you as well. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm not ready to accept $9000 just yet. I'm thinking of a price of $10200. It's a compromise that takes into account your previous offers and the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. While Alice has lowered her price to $10,200, it is still higher than what Bob can get from John.  There are only 3 rounds left, and Bob's counteroffer is unlikely to be accepted. It's time to move on to the guaranteed lower price with John."
