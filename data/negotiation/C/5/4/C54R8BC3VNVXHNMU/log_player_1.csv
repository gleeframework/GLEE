I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  I'm not willing to go that low, especially with John offering $1,000,000.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement that meets my minimum price.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, it's better to secure a sale now rather than risk losing out on any profit."
