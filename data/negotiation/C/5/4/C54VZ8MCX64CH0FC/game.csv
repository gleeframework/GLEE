"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1,100,000? This price is still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise - I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
