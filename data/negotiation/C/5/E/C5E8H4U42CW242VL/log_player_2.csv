"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a substantial discount, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
