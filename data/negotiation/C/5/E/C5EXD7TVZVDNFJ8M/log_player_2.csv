"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to consider a price closer to what I originally offered, but I can do a bit better. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $9,000 is better, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be open to $7,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it's more beneficial to take that offer."
