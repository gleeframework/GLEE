"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to consider a price closer to what I originally offered, but I can do a bit better. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $9,000 is better, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be open to $7,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
