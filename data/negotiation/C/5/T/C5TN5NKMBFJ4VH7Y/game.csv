,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $122?",122.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $122 is still a bit high for me. How about $118? That's closer to what I can afford right now.",118.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $120 is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.",120.0,Alice,5,
