"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to you ($8,000).  You have 10 rounds to negotiate and can always purchase from John as a fallback. It's better to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's important to show Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but also that you're not willing to pay her asking price. This initial counteroffer positions you for a potential compromise in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking value. I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than you're comfortable with.  You've already shown you're willing to negotiate, and there's still room to make a counteroffer. It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing willingness to compromise. It's also a more realistic price, considering the product's value to both of you.  You're close to a potential deal, and Alice is likely to accept this offer."
