"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $13000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11500?  This is a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
