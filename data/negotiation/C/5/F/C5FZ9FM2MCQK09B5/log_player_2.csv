"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great opportunity for you! I'm offering you a unique product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer matches your maximum price, there's no harm in seeing if you can get it for a slightly lower price.  You can always buy from John for $8,000 if needed."
