Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium for the product.  

I'll be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects my initial price, but I'll be watching closely for signs of his true valuation. If he's too low, I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at my absolute minimum value. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm going to reject his offer.  I believe there's still room to get a better price, especially since I know the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me. 

I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my initial offer, but still leaves room for some compromise. I'll be watching for signs that Bob is truly willing to pay more, or if he's just trying to get the best possible deal. If his counteroffers continue to be low, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm offering $1,800,000 for the product. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price. It's important to show some flexibility in negotiation, but I'm not going to undervalue the product. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my offer and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,600,000.  

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and I'm confident that I can make a profit on this sale.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob could lead to a lower price, or worse, he could walk away altogether.

Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, but Bob's offer provides me with an extra $100,000.  

It's time to close the deal and move on."
