"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe holds significant value. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. Please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1500000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000. Let me know if that works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still a bit higher than my current budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which reflects a substantial discount for me and hopefully a fair profit for you. I'm confident this is a price that can work for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a fair compromise considering the potential of this product.  I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement this round.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is closer to what I can do, but I'm still hoping to close the deal at $1275000. This price represents a significant savings for me while still allowing you a good profit.  I'm confident we can find a way to make this work.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
