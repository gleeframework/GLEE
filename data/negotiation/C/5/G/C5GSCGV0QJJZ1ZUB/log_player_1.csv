Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1500000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm aiming for a higher price than $1,200,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still a bit higher than my current budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which reflects a substantial discount for me and hopefully a fair profit for you. I'm confident this is a price that can work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

I'm still hoping to get a better price than $1,250,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is closer to what I can do, but I'm still hoping to close the deal at $1275000. This price represents a significant savings for me while still allowing you a good profit.  I'm confident we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,300,000, Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is getting closer to my desired range.  I'm accepting his offer to avoid risking a further reduction in the price or a potential loss of the sale."
