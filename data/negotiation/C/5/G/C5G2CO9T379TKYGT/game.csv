"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $800,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price reflects the product's true value while still offering you a significant gain.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the sweet spot, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'm proposing a price of $1,012,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.",1012500.0,Bob,4,
