"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply not enough. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a good deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's get this done!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference at $10,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us and get this transaction finalized.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,750.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal quickly. Let's meet in the middle.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  $9,875 is my final offer.  This is a great price for you, and it gets us both to a mutually agreeable point.  Let's make this deal happen!",9875.0,Alice,7,
