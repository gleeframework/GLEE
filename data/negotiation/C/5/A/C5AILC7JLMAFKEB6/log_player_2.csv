"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than Alice's original valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, as there's room for both parties to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $850,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. This allows for further negotiation without immediately jumping to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is only $75,000 above Bob's maximum budget.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $800,000, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and save the time and effort of further negotiation.  The potential savings of $75,000 are not worth the risk of further negotiation, especially since Bob is already close to his budget limit."
