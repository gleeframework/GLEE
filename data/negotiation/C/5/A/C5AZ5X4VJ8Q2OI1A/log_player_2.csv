"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Since you are willing to pay up to $15,000 and John is also selling the product for $15,000, there is no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can simply reject it and buy from John."
