"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, we're willing to extend this exclusive opportunity at an introductory price of $950000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $950,000 is above your desired maximum price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room to negotiate a lower price, especially since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice.
* **Exploring other options:** It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer $850,000, which still represents a significant profit for you and is within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for a compromise. 
* **Highlights Alice's profit:**  Emphasizing that the price offers a profit for Alice can make the offer more appealing. 
* **Sets a new negotiation point:** This sets a new benchmark for future discussions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, we would like to counter with a price of $900000. This remains a great value considering the product's benefits and its importance to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:**  $900,000 is still above your desired maximum price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Alice has moved closer to your price, there's still room for further negotiation, especially since you're willing to pay a higher price than what the product is worth to Alice.
* **Exploring other options:** It's still worth seeing if you can get a better deal before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  To make progress, I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000. This would allow us to close the deal quickly and I'm confident you'd still make a substantial profit."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate increase:** This offer is a modest increase from your previous counteroffer, showing that you're serious about buying but still sticking to your budget.
* **Focus on a quick deal:** Highlighting the benefit of a quick close can motivate Alice to compromise.
* **Emphasize Alice's profit:** Reinforcing that Alice would still make a good profit can be persuasive."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Within budget:** Alice's offer of $890,000 is within your budget of $1,000,000.
* **Good deal:** This price represents a significant saving compared to your initial negotiation point of $950,000 and John's offer of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While you could attempt another counteroffer, the risk of Alice rejecting it and potentially needing to buy from John for a higher price is not worth it at this point."
