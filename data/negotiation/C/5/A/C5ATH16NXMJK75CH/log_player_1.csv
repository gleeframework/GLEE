Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, and I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John who is willing to pay that amount, I'm offering Bob the product at the lowest possible price to maximize my chances of a sale.  Any higher price runs the risk of Bob rejecting the offer, leaving me with the $150 from John."
