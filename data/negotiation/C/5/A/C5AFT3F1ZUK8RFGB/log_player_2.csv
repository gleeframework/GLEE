"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it at $80. You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Therefore, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting it gives you the option to potentially find a better deal later."
