"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a price higher than her product's value to her ($1,200,000). 
* You have a fallback option with John at $1,500,000.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you might:
    * Prompt Alice to offer a lower price as she wants to avoid going to other buyers.
    * Give you time to negotiate a better deal, potentially closer to Alice's actual valuation. 

It's a negotiation tactic to try and get a better price, even though you have a guaranteed option with John."
