Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000.  It's in great condition and worth a lot more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** This offer is close to the value Bob places on the product, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product, creating a good starting point for the negotiation.
* **Room for negotiation:**  This offer allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob without immediately lowering the price too much. 
* **Safety net:**  Remember, you can always sell to John for $12,000, so there's no risk in this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob is interested, he's clearly trying to negotiate a lower price. I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price between Bob's initial offer and my previous offer. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $12,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing out on potential profit.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and emphasizes fairness, keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $12,500 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further negotiation:**  There's no reason to continue negotiating, as I won't get a better offer from Bob.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Accepting this offer avoids the risk of Bob rejecting another counteroffer and potentially ending the negotiation. 
* **Equal value:**  While Bob is getting a good deal, I'm also not losing out, as $12,000 is the minimum I'd accept."
