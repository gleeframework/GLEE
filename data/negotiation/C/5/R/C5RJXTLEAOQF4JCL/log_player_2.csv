"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000.  It's in great condition and worth a lot more. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and maintain a positive tone.**  Good negotiation involves building rapport.
* **Show genuine interest while expressing price concerns.**  
* **Make a significant counter-offer.**  Starting low gives more room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but we can still try to negotiate a bit further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. $12,500 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Acknowledging Alice's movement:** Showing we recognize her coming down helps maintain goodwill.
* **Reiterating budget constraints:** Keeps our position clear without being overly aggressive.
* **Proposing $12,000:**  This is Alice's value of the product, so it's a strong offer, but we still have a little wiggle room if needed before going to John."
