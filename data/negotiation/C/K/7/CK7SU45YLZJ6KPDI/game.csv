"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is simply not enough for me to part with it.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still gives you a good deal. Let's find a compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000, but that's my final offer.  Let's close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
