# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget ($1,200,000).**
* **This means Bob can save $250,000 by accepting Alice's offer.**
* **Even if he rejects Alice's offer and buys from John, he'll still be within his budget, but he won't get the discount.**

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob, maximizing his savings while still obtaining the desired product."
