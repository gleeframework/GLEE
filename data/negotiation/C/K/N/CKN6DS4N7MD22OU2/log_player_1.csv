Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefit it offers you."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so starting near that figure is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower offer than Bob's maximum leaves space for him to counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Highlight Value:**  Emphasize the product's worth and the unique benefit it provides Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):** Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" implies there are other potential buyers, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might lower the initial price slightly. 
* **Market Urgency:** If you need to sell quickly, a lower price might be more appealing.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome for you while maintaining a professional and persuasive approach with Bob."
