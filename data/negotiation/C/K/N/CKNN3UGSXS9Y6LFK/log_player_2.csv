"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save a significant amount of money by rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down in price to avoid losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so he's going to start by offering the absolute minimum he's willing to pay.  This sets a strong starting point for negotiation and hopefully pushes Alice to consider a much lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a lower price than Alice's first offer, Bob still has room to negotiate.  There's a chance he can get Alice to come down closer to his $1,000,000 target, especially since she already rejected a lower offer.  Continuing to negotiate is the best strategy to maximize his savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to strike a balance between getting a good deal and not risking losing the sale to John. He's raised his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise, but staying within his budget. This counteroffer might be attractive enough for Alice to accept, but still gives her a decent profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob. He's able to get the product for $1,150,000, which is only $150,000 more than his target price from John. There's a risk that he could continue to negotiate and get an even better price, but there's also the risk that Alice might walk away, and he'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is a safe and practical choice."
