"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $12,000 at this time.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $15,500. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
