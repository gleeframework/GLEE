"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $16,000? This gives you a good price while ensuring I get a fair deal. Let's find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $12,000. How about $14,000? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a little too low.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, but $15,000 is my absolute minimum. This price reflects the value of the product and ensures I get a fair return.  Let's see if we can agree on this. ",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me at $15,000. However, I was thinking that since you're already at my maximum budget, maybe we could discuss a small discount for a quick sale? I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",14500.0,Bob,6,
