"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $12,000.  It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

Bob is starting with a price closer to his maximum budget, but still leaving room for negotiation. He's being polite but firm, indicating his seriousness about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16,000. This is the best price I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, $16,000 is still above his budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, as he knows he can get the product for less from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob is steadily moving towards his goal price while still showing that he's willing to negotiate. He's also highlighting the potential benefit for Alice by getting closer to a deal."
