I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is truly interested. If he rejects, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will purchase it for my minimum price. This strategy maximizes my potential profit while ensuring I don't lose out on the deal entirely."
