"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $95, which would be a fair price for both of us. ",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.",100.0,Alice,5,
