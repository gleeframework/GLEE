Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This offer is still well above your minimum of $1,500,000, leaving you with a comfortable profit margin.
* **It shows flexibility:** The message emphasizes that you're open to negotiation, which could encourage Bob to counteroffer instead of rejecting outright. 

This strategy aims to maximize your chances of a successful negotiation while ensuring you don't undervalue your product.  Remember, you have the option to walk away and sell to John at any time if the negotiations don't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,250,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. It's in your best interest to continue negotiating. Rejecting his offer allows you to send a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your target price. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you should send a counteroffer that is slightly lower than your initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This will demonstrate flexibility while also ensuring you remain in a favorable negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from your price. How about we split the difference at $1,225,000? It's a fair compromise that leaves us both with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates a willingness to compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Maintain a favorable position:**  It's still above Bob's offer, giving you leverage. 
* **Be reasonable:** The price is halfway between your previous offer and Bob's, making it a tempting option for both parties.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while remaining within your acceptable price range. You're still looking for a higher price, but this strategy keeps Bob engaged in the process and increases the chances of a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $1,225,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000. I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has remained firm at $1,200,000, which is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer, and the risk of a prolonged negotiation is not worth it. 

Selling to John guarantees you your minimum desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.  You can confidently move on to a more profitable deal with John."
