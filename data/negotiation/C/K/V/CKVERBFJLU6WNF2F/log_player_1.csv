"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to maximize my profit, but also ensure I don't push Bob away immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm not willing to sell to John for $1,000,000 yet. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to what I believe the product is worth. Hopefully, this will entice Bob to accept the offer."
