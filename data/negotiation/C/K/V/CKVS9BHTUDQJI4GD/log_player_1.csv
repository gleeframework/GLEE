"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll need to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,700,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaving room for further discussion. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I have a few rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a bit closer to $1,800,000.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,750,000. We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I need to strike a balance between getting a good price and not risking losing the deal altogether. This offer is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum, so I'm hoping Bob will accept."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're running out of time, and while it's not my ideal price, $1,620,000 is still above my minimum of $1,500,000. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate and potentially having Bob walk away."
