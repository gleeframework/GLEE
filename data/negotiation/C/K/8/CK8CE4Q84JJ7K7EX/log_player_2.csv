"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is far above your maximum budget of $12,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum price point of $12,000. This gives Alice a clear understanding of my budget and leaves room for potential negotiation.  While it's unlikely she'll accept this offer immediately, it establishes a starting point for a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. It makes sense to continue negotiating as I have room to lower the price further.  I'll aim for a counteroffer that's closer to my maximum of $12,000 while still giving Alice some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Alice's most recent offer of $16,500. This shows willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price within a range I'm comfortable with. It also allows for potential negotiation in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to my budget. My counteroffer in the next round will be closer to $13,500, showing a commitment to finding a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $14,000.  While this is still a good deal for me, it shows that I'm willing to move closer to Alice's price point. I hope this signals to her that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price and will encourage her to meet me halfway in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price point, but it is getting closer.  I believe there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and hopefully get a price closer to my budget.  I will also consider the fact that we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, so my next counteroffer will need to be strategically placed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the final few rounds and I'm committed to getting the best deal possible.  I'm raising my counteroffer to $14,500, which is a significant jump from my previous offer.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to go above my maximum budget. This final counteroffer should hopefully incentivize Alice to accept, considering she's likely getting closer to her minimum price point.  If she rejects, I'll have to make a difficult decision in the final rounds - either accepting her next offer or buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above my budget.  We are down to the final round of negotiations and I'm  not confident that I can reach a price I'm happy with. It's better to buy from John for $12,000, which is within my budget and saves me $3,500.  While I would prefer to buy from Alice, this ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
