"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:** By starting at $120, I have room to negotiate down if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's room to negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he's shown interest.
* **Avoiding immediate settlement:**  Selling to John for $80 would be a guaranteed profit, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about $105? I'm flexible, and I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within the negotiation zone:** I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, but it's still within a range that he might be willing to accept.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him. 
* **Showing flexibility:** I'm adding a line about being flexible to encourage Bob to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit steep for me. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, he might walk away entirely. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though it's not my ideal price, securing a sale with Bob now opens the possibility of future business with him where I might be able to negotiate higher prices."
