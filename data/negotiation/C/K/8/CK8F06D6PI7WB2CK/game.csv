"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value the product highly, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price given the product's value and our shared desire to reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000.
