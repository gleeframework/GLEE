# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.

This price takes into account your concerns while still reflecting the product's worth to me.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $850,000 is a good price, and while he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
