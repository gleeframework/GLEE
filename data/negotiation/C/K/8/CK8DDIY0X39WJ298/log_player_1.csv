{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $100 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $100 is above your minimum of $120, ensuring you don't lose money.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive and allows for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

By offering $100, you create an opportunity to see if Bob is willing to pay more, while also setting a clear expectation that you won't accept a price lower than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $85 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's still a great deal for you and would allow me to sell the product without taking a loss."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. Let's compromise at $90.  That's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to buy the product without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired target. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a little bit more.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $120, as I still believe I can get a better price from Bob."
