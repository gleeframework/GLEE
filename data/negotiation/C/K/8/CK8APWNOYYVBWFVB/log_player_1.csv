Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140.

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to try and get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $160?  Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $140.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his $140 offer, and I'm not willing to go that low.  It's better to sell to John and get my minimum price."
