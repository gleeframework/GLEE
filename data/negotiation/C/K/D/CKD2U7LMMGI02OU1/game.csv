,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me in the middle at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I can meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is the lowest I can go.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you consider this price point?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9000, Bob. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I'll make one more counteroffer, and that's $10500. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,5,
