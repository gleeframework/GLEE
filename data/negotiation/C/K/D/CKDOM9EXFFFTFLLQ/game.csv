,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $950000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $850000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 850000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for 900000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $875000. This is a fair price considering the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 875000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for 885000, which is the closest I can get to your target price without compromising my own profit margin. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",885000.0,Alice,5,
