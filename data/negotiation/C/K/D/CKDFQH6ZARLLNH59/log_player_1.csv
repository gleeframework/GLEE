"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $700,000? That's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I reject Bob's offer. It's too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle at $800,000. That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
