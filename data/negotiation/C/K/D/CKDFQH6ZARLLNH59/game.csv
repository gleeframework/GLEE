"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $700,000? That's a fair starting point for negotiations.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle at $800,000. That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.",800000.0,Alice,3,
