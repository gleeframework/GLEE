Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While $700,000 is too low for me to consider, I understand your perspective on the value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it's going to be a slow climb to get anywhere near my desired price.  John offers a guaranteed $800,000 which, at this point, outweighs the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
