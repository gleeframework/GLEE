"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $550,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to accept $525,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $575,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value of the product. What do you think?",575000.0,Alice,5,
