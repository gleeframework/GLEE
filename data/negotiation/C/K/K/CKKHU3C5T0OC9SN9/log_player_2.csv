"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and considering its value to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  $11,500 is too close to your maximum, and you're likely to get a better deal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  I'm happy to consider your product but at that price, I'm closer to buying from John.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above my target of saving as much money as possible. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  Let's split the difference and make a deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,900. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to a price that's very close to my target. While I'd love to save even more, it's likely she won't go lower.  It's a good deal and saves me $1,100 compared to buying from John."
