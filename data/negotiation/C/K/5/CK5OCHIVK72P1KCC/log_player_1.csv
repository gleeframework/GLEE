{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly higher allows for potential negotiation downward if Bob tries to haggle.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  We know we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so we don't want to settle for anything less than that.

This offer aims to secure a significant profit while still remaining attractive enough for Bob to accept."
