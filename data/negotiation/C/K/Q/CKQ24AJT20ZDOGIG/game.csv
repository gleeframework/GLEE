"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1200000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1100000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford.  I'm happy to offer $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 950000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 1050000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a compromise between our previous discussions.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
