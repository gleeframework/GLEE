"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John. It's a good idea to try to negotiate with Alice first, as he might be able to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price point. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if they can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford.  I'm happy to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 950000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 1050000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a compromise between our previous discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than before, it's still above his budget. With several rounds left, it's worthwhile to continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price.  He can likely get a lower price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. "", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below 1075000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your latest offer and my previous counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 1025000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and the value you've shown it has to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than before, it's still above his budget.  With only three rounds left, he has a little room to negotiate with Alice. He can try to make a counteroffer closer to his budget and see if Alice is willing to come down further. If Alice won't budge, he can always choose to buy from John in the last round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $990,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 990000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 990000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 1015000. This is a compromise between your latest offer and my previous counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the value you've shown it has to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  It's the final round, and Alice is unlikely to budge much further.  While $1,015,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still more than he wants to pay. By buying from John, Bob saves $215,000."
