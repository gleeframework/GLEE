"Hello Alice! Thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $115? That's a fair compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer of $115, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll make a new offer: I'll sell the product to you for $125. It's a fair price that's closer to my original offer, but still a bit higher than your latest offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
