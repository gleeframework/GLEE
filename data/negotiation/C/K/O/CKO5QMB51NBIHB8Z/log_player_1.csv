Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum value:** The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.
* **Bob's value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **John's value:** John is willing to pay $1,000,000.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a price that is:

* **Higher than Bob's value:**  He'll need to consider if the extra $100,000 in value is worth it to him.
* **Lower than my minimum value:** This ensures I still make a profit, though less than if I sell to John.
* **Close to John's value:** This creates some urgency for Bob to make a decision as he knows he might lose out on the deal if he rejects. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
