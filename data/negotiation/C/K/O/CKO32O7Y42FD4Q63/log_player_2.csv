"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this represents a fair offer, but I'm open to discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.

Therefore, it makes the most sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John."
