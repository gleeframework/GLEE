Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  What do you say?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the value of the product, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. Could you consider meeting me in the middle at $1,275,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 
 
We're still comfortably above John's offer, and Bob is clearly willing to negotiate. There's room to meet closer to the middle without settling for $1,275,000.  Let's see if we can push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original number. Would you be willing to consider $1,300,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Could you consider $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{

While we could likely push Bob a little further, $1,250,000 is a strong offer.  Accepting now secures a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob backing out in later rounds."
