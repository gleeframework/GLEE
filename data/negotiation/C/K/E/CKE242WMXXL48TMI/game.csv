"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This reflects a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
