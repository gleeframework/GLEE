"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 for it right now. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $120.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit further and sell the product to you for $140.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $140.  How about we split the difference and I'll pay $130? This would be a great deal for both of us.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $135.",135.0,Alice,7,
