"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to negotiate a bit further. Would you be open to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by meeting you halfway in the previous round. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm still getting a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
