"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm offering you $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,575,000?  This would allow me to move forward with the sale, while still giving you a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1575000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,575,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,525,000.  This would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
