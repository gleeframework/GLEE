"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in paying $100 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one. You can always buy from John for $120 if needed."
