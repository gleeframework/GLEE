I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to take $1,300,000, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $1,400,000. We're getting closer, and I have 6 rounds left. I'm not going to sell to John for the minimum yet."

Round 8

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, I'm running out of time. With only 2 rounds left, I need to make a decision.  I've gotten a good deal, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get more from Bob.  It's better to take this offer than to risk getting nothing at all or having to sell to John for the minimum."
