"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is better than John's, but it's still significantly lower than my initial ask. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is too low for the value this product holds.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,025,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $2,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product, considering its value and our previous negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but not ready to accept $1,900,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. Let's bridge the gap - how about $1,975,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,975,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $1,950,000 for the product, hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $1,950,000 is a significant profit. It's time to close the deal."
