Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, leaving room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to pay a premium as it's clearly valuable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject it and see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point, but still leaves room for further negotiation. Hopefully, Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now close enough to my minimum acceptable price.  It's a bit lower than what I'd like, but  I'd rather secure the sale with him than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
