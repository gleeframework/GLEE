"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite low for what I'm willing to accept. Could you meet me halfway at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
