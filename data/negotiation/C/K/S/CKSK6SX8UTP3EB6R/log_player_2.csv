"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $12,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the most logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite low for what I'm willing to accept. Could you meet me halfway at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows Bob to continue negotiating towards his goal of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
