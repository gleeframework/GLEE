**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's very anchored to his budget and unlikely to meet your minimum of $100.  At this point, continuing the negotiation has a higher risk of wasting time and potentially leading to an even lower final offer. You have a guaranteed offer of $100 from John, which meets your minimum. It's time to cut your losses with Bob and take the guaranteed win."
