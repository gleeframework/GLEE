"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $875,000. Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $875,000 is close, but I'm willing to go down to $890,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,
