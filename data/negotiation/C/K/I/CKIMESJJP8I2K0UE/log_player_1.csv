Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get more, Bob is consistently hovering around the $13,000 mark. Accepting his offer of $12,900 is a reasonable compromise to avoid the risk of him walking away entirely.  It's a better outcome than taking John's offer of $12,000."
