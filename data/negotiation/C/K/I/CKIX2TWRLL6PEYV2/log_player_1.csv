Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefit it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a strong offer. This anchors the price high in Bob's mind.
* **Understanding Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room to negotiate above our minimum price ($800,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.

**Alternative Strategy:**

You could also start with an even higher offer, closer to $950,000, to increase the potential profit margin. However, this carries a slightly higher risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright."
