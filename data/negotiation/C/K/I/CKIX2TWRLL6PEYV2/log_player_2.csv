"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefit it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $800,000. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. She might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale. 

If Alice doesn't come back with a better offer, you can always buy from John for $1,000,000.  This way, you either save money or end up with the same outcome as accepting Alice's initial offer."
