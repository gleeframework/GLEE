"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1100000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to lower my price to $1250000. This still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1250000. How about we try to get closer to my original offer of $1100000? I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1175000. Can you consider this compromise?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1200000. This is my absolute bottom line.  I believe we can both benefit from this deal, and I'm confident that the product will be worth more than that to you in the long run. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1200000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1180000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
