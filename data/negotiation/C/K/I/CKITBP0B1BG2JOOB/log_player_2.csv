"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very reasonable price.  How does $90 sound?  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product from John for $100, and Alice is offering it for $90.  While that's a better deal than John, it's still more than the product is worth to you ($100).  Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay a bit more, but you'll still be within your budget."
