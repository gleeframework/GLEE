Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it at $80, I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price that maximizes your profit while still being appealing to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $150, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Split the Difference:** Offering the product at $120 splits the difference between Bob's valuation and your minimum acceptable price. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 provides you with a safety net if Bob rejects your offer.

By offering a price of $120, you present Bob with a deal that saves him money compared to his perceived value while also securing a significant profit margin for yourself."
