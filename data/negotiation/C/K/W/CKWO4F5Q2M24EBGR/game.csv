"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price point better reflects its true worth and potential.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $1,000,000? This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go while respecting the true value of this product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
