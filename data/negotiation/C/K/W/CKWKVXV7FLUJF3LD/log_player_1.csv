Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while still staying above our minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John for $120. 

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential for a higher profit margin."
