,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, considering the value this product holds for you. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $750,000. This offer reflects a serious buyer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $825,000. This price reflects the value you place on the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we are getting closer. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm trying to keep this purchase under $800,000. How about $780,000? This demonstrates my serious interest, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $780,000 is still below my bottom line.  I'm willing to go down to $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value the product holds for you. Let's close this deal and make this happen.",800000.0,Alice,7,
