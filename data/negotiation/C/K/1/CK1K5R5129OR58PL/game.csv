"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which I believe is fair considering its potential for your business.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
