"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $11,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $8,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",8800.0,Alice,5,
