"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $119. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $119 is better than John's price of $120, Bob can still do better.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller with a better deal."
