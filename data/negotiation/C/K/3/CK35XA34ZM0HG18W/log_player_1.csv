Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount and a fair reflection of its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which reflects a fair compromise and still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let's aim for a quick resolution.
