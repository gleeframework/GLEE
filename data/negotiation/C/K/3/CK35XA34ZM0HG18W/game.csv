"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount and a fair reflection of its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,150,000. I believe this price is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it more in line with your budget.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which reflects a fair compromise and still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let's aim for a quick resolution.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I'm still a bit short of my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My revised offer is $1,160,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1160000.0,Alice,5,
