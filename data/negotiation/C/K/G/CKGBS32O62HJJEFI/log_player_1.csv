"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. However, it sets a starting point and communicates my desire to get as close to my minimum as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000, as selling to John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While I'm open to negotiation, $950,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. I'm dropping the price significantly from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. It also reiterates that I'm looking for a fair deal for both of us, potentially encouraging Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. This is my minimum acceptable price, and while I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or I'll run out of rounds.  It's a good outcome for both of us, and I can move on."
