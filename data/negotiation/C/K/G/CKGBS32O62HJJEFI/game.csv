"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While I'm open to negotiation, $950,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
