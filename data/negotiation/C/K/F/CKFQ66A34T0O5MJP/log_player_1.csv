Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm going for a 10% profit, which is a reasonable margin. I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters, but I'll always have John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While it's tempting to sell to him for a quick profit, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

I've reduced my price by a bit, but I'm still holding out for a profit. $10,250 is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will see that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me. How about $10,000? That would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price. While I'd prefer to get a bit more, it's not worth risking the deal and losing out on a sale altogether. Accepting his offer guarantees me a $10,000 profit, which is a good outcome."
