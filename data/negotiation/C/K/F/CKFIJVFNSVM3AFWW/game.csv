,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it.  However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about we split the difference and I pay $80? It's a fair price for both of us and lets us close this deal quickly.",80.0,Bob,4,
