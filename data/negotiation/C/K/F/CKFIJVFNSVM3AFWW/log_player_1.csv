"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm open to offers, but my starting price is $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This initial offer is high, but it allows for room to negotiate.  It also positions me as the seller with the control, and prompts Bob to reveal some of his own valuation of the product.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it.  However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for more.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about we split the difference and I pay $80? It's a fair price for both of us and lets us close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's also the same price I can get from John.  It's time to close the deal with Bob and avoid any further negotiation."
