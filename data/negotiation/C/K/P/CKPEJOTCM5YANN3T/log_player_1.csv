"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. This also leaves me some buffer if Bob counteroffers, while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,800 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm running out of rounds and  selling to John for $12,000 would be a less profitable outcome. It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
