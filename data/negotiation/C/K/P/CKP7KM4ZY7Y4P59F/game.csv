"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This offer stands until the end of round 4.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair offer, reflecting a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
