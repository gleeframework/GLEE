"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice's offer is $1,400,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **John is a backup option.** You know you can buy from John for $1,500,000 if you can't reach a better deal with Alice.

By rejecting the offer, you open the door to potentially saving money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is offering the product for $1,350,000.
* **It's a good compromise.**  You've lowered your initial counteroffer, and Alice has come down from her initial offer. 
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  You can save $150,000 by accepting Alice's offer.

While you might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, the potential savings are not significant enough to risk losing the deal with Alice."
