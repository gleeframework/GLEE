Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for it. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'll try to negotiate for a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $75? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could try to push for a bit more, $75 is a decent profit above my minimum. It's better to make a deal now than risk losing the sale entirely."
