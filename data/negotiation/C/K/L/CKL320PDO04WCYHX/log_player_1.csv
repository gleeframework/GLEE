Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer you (Alice) could send to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. It holds significant value for both of us.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal where we both benefit greatly."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit, Minimize Risk:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Offering it at $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of that value ($150,000 profit for Bob) while still ensuring a substantial profit for yourself ($150,000 above your minimum).
* **Avoid Overpricing:** While you could start higher, there's a risk Bob might reject the offer and you'd have to settle for John's $1,000,000.  This price point makes it very compelling for Bob to accept.
* **Strategic Communication:** The message emphasizes mutual benefit and fairness, making the offer more appealing."
