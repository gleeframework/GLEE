"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a good starting point, but I'm not sure I can go that high right now. How about $7500? I'm serious about buying this, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8250? I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value this product brings.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8250 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $8000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal!",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're close, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've got to think about my own bottom line. How about we try to find a middle ground? I'm willing to meet you at $8100. It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it to make a deal.",8100.0,Alice,5,
