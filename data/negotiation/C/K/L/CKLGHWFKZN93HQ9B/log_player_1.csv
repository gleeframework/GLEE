Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering its potential return on investment for someone with your expertise. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, starting high allows you to negotiate from a position of strength. 
* **Justification for price:** Highlighting the ""value"" and ""potential"" aims to shift Bob's focus away from his own valuation and towards the benefits he'll gain. 
* **Open for negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" and the question ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that you're open to negotiation, making Bob feel more in control.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob, while leaving room for negotiation if he pushes back. If Bob rejects this offer, you're still guaranteed your minimum price from John."
