"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer that's significantly above your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, providing a basis for the high initial price.
* **Openness:**  While starting high, Alice expresses willingness to discuss the price, indicating flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This initial offer is significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and John's guaranteed offer. This allows Alice to potentially secure a much higher profit if Bob is willing to negotiate, while still having the safety net of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant improvement, it's still considerably lower than Alice's initial asking price and well above Bob's perceived value of the product. This suggests there's room for further negotiation. Alice knows she has John as a backup who's willing to pay her minimum acceptable price, so she can afford to be a bit bolder in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product brings, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its potential."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice is making a significant concession from her initial offer ($2,300,000 to $2,100,000) to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Above the Middle:** This counteroffer positions the price closer to Alice's desired outcome while still leaving room for Bob to move upward. It's a strong signal that she's seeking a price above the simple midpoint ($1,900,000) between their initial offers. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message reiterates the product's value and presents the counteroffer as a carefully considered ""fair compromise,"" aiming to encourage Bob to meet her closer to her desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,950,000, while a compromise, is still significantly higher than his perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). This indicates there's a good chance he might be willing to go even higher.
* **Negotiating Room:** Alice still has room to negotiate downwards from her last counteroffer ($2,100,000) and potentially meet Bob somewhere in the middle.  
* **John as Security:** The safety net of John's offer ($1,500,000) allows Alice to continue negotiating strategically without the risk of losing out completely. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, Alice should aim for a counteroffer slightly above Bob's perceived value but below her previous offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while pushing for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To find a solution we both feel good about, let's settle on $2,050,000. This deal gets us both what we want."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** Alice makes a smaller concession this round ($50,000), signaling she's firming up her position but still open to a deal. 
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This offer is slightly closer to Alice's previous price than Bob's, but the message frames it as mutually beneficial.  
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying ""let's settle,"" Alice injects some urgency to encourage Bob to agree rather than dragging out the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** While not ideal, $1,900,000 is still a significant profit for Alice ($400,000 above her minimum and $900,000 above Bob's perceived value). 
* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob's firm tone (""no higher"") suggests this is likely his final offer. Pushing further could make him walk away.
* **Time Considerations:** There are only a few rounds left, and securing the deal now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or Alice needing to settle for John's price. 

**Overall:**  Accepting this offer balances maximizing profit with the practicalities of negotiation and time constraints."
