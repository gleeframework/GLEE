"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I really like the product, but I have a limited budget and I'm trying to stay within it. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your offer. I'll counteroffer at $16500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can only go up to $15500. Can you consider this price?",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll counteroffer at $17000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I hope you can meet me at this price.",17000.0,Alice,5,
