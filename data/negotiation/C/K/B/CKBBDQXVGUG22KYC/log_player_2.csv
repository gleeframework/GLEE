"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first. $120 is better than $150, but there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

Let's start by aiming for the price Alice values the product at. It's an ambitious counteroffer, but it doesn't hurt to try. If she rejects it, we can always negotiate upwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met us halfway! $110 is a great price, saving us $40 compared to John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a better deal from Alice at this point, so it's best to accept and secure the product."
