"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us. It's still above my minimum, and it leaves you with a good profit.  Let's close this deal!",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,250 for the product. That's my final offer.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but $9,250 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference again and go with $9,625.  This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",9625.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $9,625 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,200 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",9200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're close to a deal. I'm going to come down to $9,400 as my final offer. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it's just above my minimum.  Let's make this happen.",9400.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you don't accept it.",9000.0,Bob,10,
