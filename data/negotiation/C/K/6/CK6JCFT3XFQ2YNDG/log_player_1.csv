Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a better price. However, it's important to remember that I can always fall back on selling to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is below my minimum acceptable price, but it's still close.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  Hopefully, this will be a more appealing price for Bob, while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to sell to him. This ensures I don't lose out on any potential profit, and I can avoid further negotiation with Bob."
