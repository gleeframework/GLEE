Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more.
* **Justification:**  While the justification is brief, it implies the product is worth more than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Gauge Interest:** Offering it to Bob ""first"" creates a subtle sense of exclusivity and allows you to gauge his interest level. If he flat out rejects the $200, you can always negotiate down before going to John. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy.  There are other approaches depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to ensure a sale to Bob."
