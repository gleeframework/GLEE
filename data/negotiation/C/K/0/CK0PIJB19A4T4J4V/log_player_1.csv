Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11500} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm dropping the price slightly, showing flexibility. I'm still above my minimum, and hoping to meet Bob halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob has already rejected my counteroffer and is sticking to his original price. While $10,500 is a decent price, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the best option at this point."
