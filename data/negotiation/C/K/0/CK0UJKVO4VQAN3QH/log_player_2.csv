"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is asking for $150, which is way too high. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering $100 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for some negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. I'll reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $110, which is still below Alice's latest offer but closer to my target price. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Alice, but I'm also prepared to go to John if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still $5 higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to try one more time with a counter-offer of $115. This is a fair compromise between Alice's offer and my target price. If she rejects this, I'll go to John and buy the product for $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice's offer of $122 is getting closer, it's still not as good as what John is offering for $120.  I'm going to go with John for a guaranteed lower price."
