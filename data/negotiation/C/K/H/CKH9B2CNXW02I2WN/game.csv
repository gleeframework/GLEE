"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $750,000 is a reasonable offer, it's below my minimum price point. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000. How about we try $775,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
