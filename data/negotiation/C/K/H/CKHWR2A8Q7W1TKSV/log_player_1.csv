Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $12,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and persuasive, highlighting the value of the product to Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings by:

* **Gaining a higher price:** While $12,000 is less than my guaranteed sale price to John, it's still a significant profit.
* **Minimizing risk:** There's a chance Bob might accept the offer, allowing me to sell the product and avoid the uncertainty of waiting for John's purchase."
