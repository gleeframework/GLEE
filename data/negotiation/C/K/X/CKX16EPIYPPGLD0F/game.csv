"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks fantastic, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,050,000 is closer, but still a touch outside my budget. How about $975,000? I'm ready to close the deal today at that price.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $1,025,000? This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
