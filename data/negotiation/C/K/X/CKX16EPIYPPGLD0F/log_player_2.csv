Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $1,025,000? This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

Alice seems unlikely to budge further, and while we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are unlikely to offset the risk of her withdrawing the offer entirely. Buying from John guarantees the product at our target price."
