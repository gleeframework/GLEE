Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation or makes an immediate acceptance at a favorable price more likely.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  $13,500 is a price point that's significantly above Bob's perceived value but still potentially attractive compared to not getting the product at all. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, so there's less pressure to drastically lower the price for Bob."
