,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about $850,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it still leaves you room for profit.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm open to finding a solution, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I need to be closer to $800,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $775,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $775,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I can't go any lower than $750,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm confident that this is a win-win scenario for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,7,
