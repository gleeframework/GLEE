Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into his eagerness to purchase. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything, as you have John as a backup buyer.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message implies its value by mentioning ""significant value."" This framing can potentially justify the higher price in Bob's mind."
