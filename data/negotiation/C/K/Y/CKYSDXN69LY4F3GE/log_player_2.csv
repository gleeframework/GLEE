"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down further in price, getting you a better deal."
