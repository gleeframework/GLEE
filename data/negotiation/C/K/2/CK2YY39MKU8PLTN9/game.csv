"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I know you'll find very valuable.  I'm offering it to you at a special price of $9,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this product.  I believe this is still a fair price considering its value. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet you at $9,000. I would like to offer $8,500 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the offer of $8,500.  However,  I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $8,750 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,5,
