"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm confident you'll find this a good deal.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $102 is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to your last offer. Let's close the deal.",102.0,Alice,7,
