Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum desired price ($1,500,000) but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it. I'm also keeping the message concise and focused on the value proposition for him.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  I'm starting high enough to ensure a good profit, but low enough to be enticing to Bob.
* **Maintain leverage:** By having a backup buyer (John), I'm not forced to accept any offer that is too low. 
* **Initiate negotiation:** This offer establishes a starting point for the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's also far less than the value the product holds to me. I cannot accept this offer.

**Strategy:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll try to bridge the gap between our current positions while maintaining my leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth more than that, and I'm sure you understand its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $1,000,000, which is the midpoint between my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and Bob's offer ($800,000). This shows flexibility while still maintaining a profitable deal for me.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" for both parties. This creates a sense of compromise and encourages Bob to consider my offer seriously. 

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still staying within my profit range. This should encourage him to come closer to my desired price in the next round."
