"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be incredibly valuable for your business.  My starting price is $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to discussing it further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle around $850,000? I think that's a fair price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit while acknowledging the value you see in the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be completely transparent, my budget limit is $900,000. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I understand, but I may need to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
