I'm starting with a price of $17,000, slightly higher than Bob's estimated value. This gives me some room for negotiation while still being a good starting point."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'll reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  While selling to John is tempting, I want to see if I can close this deal with Bob at a better price."
