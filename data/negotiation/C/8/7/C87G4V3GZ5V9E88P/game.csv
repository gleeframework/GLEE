"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been working on for a while, and I'm confident it can help you achieve your goals.  I understand it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,200,000. This allows for a significant gain for you while still being a profitable deal for me. I'm sure you'll agree this is a fantastic opportunity. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
