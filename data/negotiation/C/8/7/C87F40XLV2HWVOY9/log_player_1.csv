"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a strong opening position that leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value.  I'm confident that Bob, seeing the value of the product, will be motivated to negotiate a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is close to my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to sell for less than the product is worth to me.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. It's also a price point that still leaves me with a profit margin and reflects the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I still see an opportunity to negotiate a better price. I'm confident that I can reach a mutually agreeable price, and I'm not ready to settle for less than I believe the product is worth.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,250,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal and that I'm willing to meet him halfway.  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable value, but it's significantly lower than my previous counteroffer.  I hope that Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating until we reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable value.  I've made a good effort to get a higher price, but at this point, accepting Bob's offer is the best option to guarantee a sale and maximize my earnings."
