{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's above your maximum budget and you can potentially get the product cheaper. It's worth negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes my strong interest in the product, but also shows that I'm serious about getting a better price.  I'm hoping to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I might be able to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate. It's also worth noting that John's offer is only $50,000 higher than Alice's current offer, and I still have several rounds to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm now offering Alice's minimum price, which is the same as John's offer. I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer since it's her minimum acceptable price. If she rejects, I'm ready to buy from John at the same price, so there's no risk involved in this counteroffer."
