"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $700,000 is a significant amount, it doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise.  This allows us both to benefit from the deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
