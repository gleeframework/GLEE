{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a great value for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is beneficial to me (Alice). I'm asking for a bit more than the product is worth to Bob, but not so much that it's likely he'll immediately reject it. I've also included a friendly message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for your product. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to get at least $9,800 to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,600 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my target. I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get significantly higher with more negotiation, and I'm also concerned about potentially losing too much time. Selling to John for $10,000 is a safe and guaranteed option that aligns with my minimum price requirement."
