Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the middle ground between my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000). 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, which is more likely to encourage him to consider it. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message indicates I'm open to discussion and I'm not inflexible. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation in a way that is both beneficial to me and leaves room for potential compromise."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price of $10,000. 
* **More negotiation potential:** I believe there's room for more negotiation.  I have 8 rounds left and can use them to try to get closer to my ideal price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and try to secure a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. Let's meet in the middle. How about $11,100? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 11100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's counteroffer ($10,800). This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, emphasizing that the price is still reasonable considering its benefits. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable and increase the chances of a successful outcome. 

By offering a compromise, I'm trying to strike a balance between securing a good price and moving the negotiation forward."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about $10900? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below $10,000. 
* **Plenty of rounds left:** I still have 6 rounds to negotiate and can potentially increase the price further. 
* **Risk of selling to John:** Selling to John now would mean losing out on the potential for a higher price from Bob.

I'm choosing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I'm still a bit off on the price.  How about we split the difference again?  I'm willing to go down to $11,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($11,100) and Bob's counteroffer ($10,900). This continues to show my willingness to compromise and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasizing concession:** I'm explicitly stating that this is a significant concession on my part, highlighting the value of the deal for Bob.
* **Reminding Bob of the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he will receive, subtly reinforcing that this price is still a good deal for him. 

This strategy aims to demonstrate my flexibility while still staying within my desired price range, increasing the chances of reaching a deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference again, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about $10700? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,700 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, the chances of getting a higher price from Bob are diminishing. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, which is my minimum. 

While I would prefer to get more, I'm running out of time and the risk of ending up with nothing is too high.  Selling to John at this point ensures a secure profit."
