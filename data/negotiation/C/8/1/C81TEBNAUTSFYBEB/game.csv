"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see that you're a serious buyer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10000. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000. Is that something you'd consider?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $14000? It's a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
