"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me halfway and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This reflects the value I believe it will bring to you.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $8,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $8,375? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",8375.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I can tell you're serious about the product.  How about we split the difference again and land at $8,562.50? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll receive.",8562.5,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but $8,562.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $8,281.25? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",8281.25,Bob,6,
