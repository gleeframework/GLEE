"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you say?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too much for me. I'm happy to pay $95, which is a good price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $105. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can make a deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $105 is closer to what I can afford, it's still slightly out of my budget.  I'm happy to pay $100 for the product. This is my final offer, let's see if we can close this deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
