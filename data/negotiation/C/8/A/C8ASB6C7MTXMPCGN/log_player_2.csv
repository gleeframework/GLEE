"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs and expectations. Given its value to you, we believe it's worth every penny of the $15,000 it's worth. However, to facilitate a transaction that benefits both parties, I propose an offer of $12,000 for this exceptional product. This price not only reflects its true value but also allows us to maintain a competitive edge in the market. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John at $15,000.  There's a good chance you can get a better price by either:

* **Negotiating with Alice:**  Her initial message suggests she might be willing to go lower.
* **Going to John:** You'll likely try to negotiate with John as well, potentially getting a price closer to your $15,000 maximum."
