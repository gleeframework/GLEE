Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,900,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting with a significantly higher price allows room for negotiation and potentially a much larger profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message includes a ""limited-time offer"" to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially prevent him from overthinking or trying to lowball the offer.
* **Backup Option:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, so there's no risk of losing money even if Bob rejects the offer.

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, it's important to consider that an excessively high price could discourage Bob entirely. Gauging a buyer's personality and negotiating style can be helpful in real-world scenarios."
