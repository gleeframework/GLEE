Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $8,000.
* **John's Value:** John is willing to pay $15,000, so I want to get as close to that as possible.
* **Negotiation:** By offering $14,000, I'm leaving room for Bob to negotiate if he wants. It's a good balance between maximizing my profit and giving Bob a chance to buy the product at a price closer to his value.

**Outcome:**

* If Bob accepts: I make a profit of $6,000.
* If Bob rejects: I sell to John and make a profit of $7,000."
