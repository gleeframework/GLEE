"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  I'll see how he responds before potentially adjusting my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $70 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering at $120. This is still a good profit margin for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer and shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit in his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$80 is still below my minimum price, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to continue to negotiate, hoping to get a better price.  I'm also concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, I might run out of rounds and be forced to sell to John for $100, which is lower than I'd like."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering $110. I'm hoping to meet Bob halfway. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John.  I'm not sure how much wiggle room I have left with only 5 rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While $85 is better than $70 or $80, it's still below my minimum desired price of $100.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm concerned that Bob won't budge any further and I'll be forced to accept a price lower than $100.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and with so few rounds left, it's the safest option."
