"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,500,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,500,000 is way over his budget and he can get the same product from John for $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price is possible, but there's no need to accept her initial offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're a savvy buyer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than his budget.  He can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, so there's no need to pay more. He should try to negotiate with Alice again."
