"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong opening offer of $1,150,000. This anchors the negotiation closer to our desired outcome.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** While the offer is high, it leaves room for negotiation and allows us to make concessions later in the process.
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message highlights the ""value and potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price.  We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John guarantees our desired profit.  Therefore, we'll politely decline Bob's offer and prepare a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but there's still a gap between our positions. This product offers exceptional value, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:**  We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and maintain a positive and collaborative tone. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $1,100,000, we're meeting Bob halfway between his offer and our previous asking price.  This can signal a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** We subtly remind Bob of the product's value to justify our position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but $1,075,000 is still too far below our minimum. We're willing to negotiate further, but we need to see Bob move closer to our price range. We have time and the security of John's offer, so we'll continue the negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  Would you consider $1,090,000?"",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're reducing our counteroffer by a smaller amount ($10,000) to signal that we're getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Focus on Value:**  We continue to reiterate the product's value, subtly reminding Bob why we can't go much lower. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** By asking ""Would you consider...,"" we invite Bob to respond with flexibility and potentially propose a counter-offer closer to our target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $1,060,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, the negotiation progress is too slow. At this rate, we risk ending up with a less-than-ideal outcome. We need to encourage Bob to make a more significant move. We have the advantage of John's offer as a safety net, so we'll reject and hold our ground more firmly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be upfront. $1,090,000 is my absolute best price.  This product is a unique opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment at this price."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're holding our ground at $1,090,000, signaling this is our bottom line. The tone is firm but still respectful and open to the deal.
* **Highlighting Value and Opportunity:**  We're shifting the focus to the long-term benefits and the missed opportunity if Bob doesn't accept this offer.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By presenting this as our ""best and final"" offer, we're subtly introducing a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but no lower. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has reached his final offer, and it's still significantly below our desired outcome. Further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of not reaching an agreement, and we might lose the opportunity to sell to John. 

It's time to cut our losses with Bob. We've negotiated in good faith, but it's more profitable to move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
