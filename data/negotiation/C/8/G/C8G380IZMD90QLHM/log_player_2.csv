"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm open to negotiation. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still a significant amount.  You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum acceptable price. This shows you're serious about buying the product, but also that you're trying to get a good deal. It leaves room for negotiation in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good compromise. This price is still within my budget and is a better deal than buying from John.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my offer or I might end up buying from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer at this point secures the product at a reasonable price."
