"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming to secure a price closer to my valuation.  Bob knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, but he may be willing to pay a bit more to secure it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my valuation, I'm still aiming for more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a significant profit.  This should encourage Bob to consider the offer while still keeping the price relatively high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,150,000 is getting closer to what Bob is willing to pay, I'm not yet ready to accept.  There's still room for a higher offer from Bob, and I'd rather risk a few more rounds of negotiation than settle for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly.  I'm trying to signal that I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to significantly lower my asking price. I hope this will encourage Bob to make one final push to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, it's getting increasingly clear that Bob isn't going to budge much higher.  With only 4 rounds left, it's risky to keep negotiating. It's time to secure the guaranteed deal with John for $1,500,000."
