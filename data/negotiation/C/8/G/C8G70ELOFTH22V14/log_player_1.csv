Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counter. Remember, you can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $12,250 for the product. Let's split the difference and get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing the sale.  Accepting his offer will secure a profit and avoid any further negotiation."
