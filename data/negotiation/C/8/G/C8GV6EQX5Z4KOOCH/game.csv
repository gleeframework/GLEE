"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, I'm not quite ready to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're trying to save as much as possible, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
