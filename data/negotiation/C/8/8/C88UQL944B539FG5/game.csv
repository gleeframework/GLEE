"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're dancing around each other a bit. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your limit, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm also considering other options. Let's see if we can get closer to my target price.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $10,000 is my absolute limit and I'm sticking to it. If you can't make that work, I understand, but I may have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on $10,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one final offer to meet you in the middle, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to consider other options. Let's try $10,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",10500.0,Alice,9,
