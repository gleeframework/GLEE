Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, our guaranteed minimum.  Therefore, we should aim for a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  It also emphasizes the product's high value. 
* **Respectful Tone:** The message is positive and avoids pressuring Bob, increasing the chance of a successful deal."
