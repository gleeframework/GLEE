Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would greatly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, still landing within a profitable range for you. 
* **Strong But Not Greedy:** $9,500 secures a significant profit while still offering Bob a compelling discount compared to his own valuation.
* **Alternative Exists:** The message doesn't explicitly mention John, keeping a sense of scarcity without resorting to pressure tactics."
