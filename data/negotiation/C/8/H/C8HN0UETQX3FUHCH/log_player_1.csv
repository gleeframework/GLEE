"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin while still being potentially appealing to Bob. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $150 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it right away. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $160 is closer to my minimum, I want to try and see if I can get closer to $175. I have a few rounds left and I can always sell to John as a backup."

At this point, I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $165. We're getting close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. There are only a few rounds left, and I'm confident that I've secured a good price."
