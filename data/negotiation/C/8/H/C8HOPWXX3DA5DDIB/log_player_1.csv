``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible while still getting a profit for myself. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's not worth selling to him at this point. I'll counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about $1,150,000?  This gives you a great deal while ensuring I can still make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit away from that number. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer. I'm going to counteroffer again, trying to push him closer to my target while leaving room for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,125,000.  This compromise will allow us to finalize the deal and ensure both of us are satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I can see you're firm on your price, so I'll offer $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've reached a point where I'm confident I can secure my minimum price with John.  I'm going to sell the product to John and avoid further potential losses with Bob."
