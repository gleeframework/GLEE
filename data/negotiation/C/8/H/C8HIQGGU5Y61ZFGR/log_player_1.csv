"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good chance of earning a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more if I continue negotiating. I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I hope this will be enticing enough for Bob to consider, but it still allows me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get closer to $9,000.  I'll continue negotiating in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,750. This is a smaller adjustment, showing that I'm getting closer to accepting his price. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation in case he wants to go even higher."
