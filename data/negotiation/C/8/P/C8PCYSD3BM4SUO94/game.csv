"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $90, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested, or we can call it a day. ",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's not your ideal price, Alice, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $75? That's a fair offer, considering its current market value.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that.  However, $75 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested at this price, I might have to explore other options. ",85.0,Alice,5,
