"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $80.  This leaves room for negotiation, and hopefully, we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm also reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $60 is way too low.  It's significantly less than what the product is worth to me (at least $100) and only slightly more than what it's worth to him ($80). I'm not going to accept that offer, but I'm not going to sell to John just yet either. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $90, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested, or we can call it a day. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $100, but I'm acknowledging Bob's budget by lowering the price. I'm also setting a firm tone by calling it my ""final offer"" to see if I can close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's not your ideal price, Alice, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $75? That's a fair offer, considering its current market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $75 is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum of $100, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $80 at this point, and I'm not ready to sell to John just yet.  I'll see if I can convince Bob to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that.  However, $75 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested at this price, I might have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm coming down to $85, which is a significant compromise but still above my minimum of $100. I'm also using a firmer tone by mentioning other options, hoping to push Bob to accept the offer."
