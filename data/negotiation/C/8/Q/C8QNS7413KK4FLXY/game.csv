"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer you $7,500. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,250. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $8,250 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $8,000?  That's my absolute maximum, and it's still a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
