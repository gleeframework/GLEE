"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,800,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $1,500,000 price point is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but based on my financial situation, I can't agree to the $1,650,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I hope this proposal is more acceptable.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
