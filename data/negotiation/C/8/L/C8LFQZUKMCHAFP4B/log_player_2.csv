# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you.  If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000, so you have a chance to save a considerable amount.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
