Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal for you! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with my desired price, knowing that it's above Bob's perceived value. This will give me a good starting point for negotiation, and I'm always open to making counteroffers if necessary. If Bob rejects, I'll assess the situation and potentially make a lower counteroffer or sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can only pay up to $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm offering a counter-price of $125. This is a compromise that is closer to my minimum price of $150, but still potentially attractive to Bob.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or if it's better to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given this some thought, and I can definitely see the value in the product. I would like to propose $110 as my offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to push the price higher. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price.  $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 117.5}
```

I'm offering a counter-price of $117.50. This is a compromise that is closer to my minimum price of $150, but still potentially attractive to Bob.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or if it's better to sell to John for $150."
