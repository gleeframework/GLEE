"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're excited about the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle on $108? It's still a good deal for you, and I can make a bit more on the sale.",108.0,Alice,5,
