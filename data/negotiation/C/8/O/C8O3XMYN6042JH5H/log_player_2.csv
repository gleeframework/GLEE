"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $14,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $15,000. 
* Even though you could buy from John for $15,000, accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000."
