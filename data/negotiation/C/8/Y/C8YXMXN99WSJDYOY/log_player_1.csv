Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum price, as it's the best for me. If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll see if he's willing to negotiate, but I have John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$105 is not enough for me. I'll counter with a higher price, but I'll keep John in mind as my fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still need to make a decent profit. $115 is a fair compromise, and hopefully Bob will see that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough for me to make a decent profit.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price."
