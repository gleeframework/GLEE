Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130. This product is really high-quality and I'm sure you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, maybe around $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible but $75 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping to get.  How about we split the difference from my previous offer and go with $100? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $100 is closer, I'm afraid I can't go that high. My absolute maximum would be $80.  That's all I have budgeted for this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to meet Alice's price point.  While he might budge a little more, it's unlikely he'll go significantly higher than $80. Alice has a guaranteed offer from John for $120. It makes more financial sense to take the sure thing and sell to John."
