Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below your target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?

While I could try to negotiate further, $825,000 is a reasonable price and a significant savings compared to John's offer. It's time to close the deal."
