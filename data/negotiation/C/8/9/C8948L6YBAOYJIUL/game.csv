"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counter with a price of $9,250 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price considering our both valuations. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're getting closer to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to pay $9,000, we can finalize the deal today.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on $9,000, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. This is a fair compromise and we can close the deal today.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point of diminishing returns, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $9,100, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to pay $9,100, we can finalize the deal today.",9100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still holding out for $8,800. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal today. Let's make it happen.",8800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one last attempt to get closer to my valuation. I'll meet you at $9,150, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to pay $9,150, we can finalize the deal today.",9150.0,Alice,9,
