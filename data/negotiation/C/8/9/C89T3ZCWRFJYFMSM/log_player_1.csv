Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal could occur are between $1,200,001 (anything less benefits Bob more) and $1,499,999 (anything more, and you're better off with John).

**Offer Strategy**

You want to start high to maximize your potential profit but also consider the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting closer to your ideal outcome while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique value and potential"" subtly reinforces the product's worth without being overly aggressive.
* **Leaving Room:** This price gives Bob a chance to counter-offer and potentially reach a deal within the ZOPA.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Counter:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go.  
* **Walk-Away Power:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed backup, so don't be afraid to walk away if Bob's offers are too low."
