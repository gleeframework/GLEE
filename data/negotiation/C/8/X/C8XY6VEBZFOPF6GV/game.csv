"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Considering its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment for you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to spend. Given my research, I believe a fair starting price for this product is $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a reasonable offer that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. It possesses features and capabilities that justify a higher price point. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects the true value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
