Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($15,000) gives you room to negotiate down if needed.  
* **Justification:** While not revealing your minimum, the message hints at the product's value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower your price, but never go below your $10,000 minimum."
