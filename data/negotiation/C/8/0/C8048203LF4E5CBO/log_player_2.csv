You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can get the product for cheaper from Alice, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best move."

Alice's offer:

You can still get the product for cheaper from Alice. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more before settling for $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $100? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is only offering $5 above your ideal price. While it would be nice to get it for even less, it's not worth risking the deal and buying from John for significantly more.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy here."
