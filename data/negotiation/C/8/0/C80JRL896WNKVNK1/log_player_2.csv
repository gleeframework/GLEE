(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my maximum willingness to pay. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,100,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer. I'm showing flexibility while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still slightly above my preferred price point. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejections and a potential stalemate is increasing. Buying from John for $1,000,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget."
