"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is still too high.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within your budget. This shows Alice you're serious about buying the product but are also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high, but it's getting closer to your target. It makes sense to reject the offer again and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
``` 

You're getting closer to your target price! This offer is a compromise - it's a bit higher than your last counteroffer but still significantly lower than Alice's offer. This shows you're willing to be flexible, but you're also determined to get the best deal possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now within your budget and very close to your target price. There's a chance you could get a lower price in the next round, but it's not guaranteed.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product and saves you from going back and forth with Alice further."
