"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
