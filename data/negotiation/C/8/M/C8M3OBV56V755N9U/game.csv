"Alice, your price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I'm really interested in this product and think this is a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,250 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
