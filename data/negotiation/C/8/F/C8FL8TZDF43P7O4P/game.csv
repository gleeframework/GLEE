"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my original price. How about we meet in the middle between $120 and $110? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you consider that price?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet in the middle between $115 and $105? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
