Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures that you are still making a profit if he accepts.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can adjust the price based on Bob's response and keep the negotiation going. 

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and either accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum price and the possibility of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept and sell now, I believe I can do better. I will counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still not able to meet you at $11,000. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is adamant about his price, and it's clear that we won't be able to reach an agreement.  Rather than continue negotiating and potentially lowering my price further, I will accept John's offer of $15,000.  This is the best outcome for me, ensuring I meet my minimum price and receive a fair value for my product."
