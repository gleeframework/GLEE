"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. My initial offer is $9,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm aiming to stay under $9,000, so I'm offering $8,800.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. How about we aim for a price of $9,000? This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $9,000 is below Bob's $10,000 limit.
* **It's a good deal for Bob:** Although Bob initially aimed for $8,800,  $9,000 is still a significant saving compared to buying from John. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield much more:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds increases. 

Accepting the offer secures the product at a fair price within the time limit."
