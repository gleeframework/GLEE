"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet that price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,300,000? This leaves some room for both of us to make a deal.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we meet at $1,250,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can make a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your effort to meet halfway.  However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000.  This is a good deal for both of us and keeps the negotiations moving forward. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one last offer: $1,200,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
