Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great price for you considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think.

While closer to a reasonable price, we can likely negotiate Alice down a little further before resorting to John."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm happy to negotiate. But $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about $12,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close the deal. What do you say?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is a good compromise, saving $2500 compared to John's offer."
