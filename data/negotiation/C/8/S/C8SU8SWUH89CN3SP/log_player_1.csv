Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies that the price is justified. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's thoughts, suggesting a willingness to negotiate.
* **Alternative Option:**  While not explicitly stated, mentioning a public listing subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't take this offer, creating a bit of urgency.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still maintaining a professional and non-aggressive approach."
