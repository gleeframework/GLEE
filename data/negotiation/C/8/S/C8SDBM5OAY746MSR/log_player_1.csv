"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm not comfortable with Bob's lowball offer. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000. How about $1275000?

While Bob's offer is closer, it's still too low. I'll counter again to try and close the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, but I can't go lower than $1,312,500. This represents a substantial discount for you, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1312500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about $1287500?

While Bob's offer is getting closer, we're running out of rounds and I'm not sure I can get a price I'm comfortable with.  I'll take John's offer to avoid risking getting a worse deal."
