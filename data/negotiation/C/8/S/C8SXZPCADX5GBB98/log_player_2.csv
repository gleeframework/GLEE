# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $12,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, but I have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. There's no reason to negotiate with Alice when you have a better option readily available."
