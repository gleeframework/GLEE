Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $15,000, but am open to discussing a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and your minimum ($12,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The initial high price allows you to assess Bob's level of interest. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything, as you have John as a backup.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more than $12,000, especially if you present a strong case for the product's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions openness to negotiation, making you appear flexible and increasing the likelihood of a deal. 

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, it's generally better to secure a deal sooner rather than later. If Bob senses you're not in a rush, he might lowball you."
