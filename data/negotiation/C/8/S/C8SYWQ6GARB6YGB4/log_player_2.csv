"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$800,000 is a good price, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.** You have room to negotiate and save even more money.
* **Buying from John right now is a poor decision.** You can potentially get the product for much cheaper by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Starting with a lower counteroffer puts pressure on Alice and shows your intent to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Range:**  $600,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's true bottom line and how willing she is to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down in price:** This is a positive sign. While $750,000 is a decent price, it's likely you can still negotiate a lower price. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's still room to push Alice lower and potentially get the product for an even better price.
* **Avoid Premature Buy:** Buying from John at this point would be a wasted opportunity. You're getting closer to a good deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** This counteroffer is a smaller step than the previous one, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Close to the Target:** $700,000 is closer to Alice's latest offer, suggesting a potential meeting point.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or make a counteroffer, allowing you to assess her willingness to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Difference:** Alice's offer is only $25,000 higher than your previous counteroffer. 
* **Good Price:** $725,000 is a good price, saving you a significant amount compared to John's price.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Alice walking away, leaving you with only John's offer. Accepting now secures the product at a good price."
