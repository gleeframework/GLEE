"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this exceptional product! Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,750,000 would be a fair starting point for our negotiation. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit too low for me.  I understand you're focused on market value, but this product is truly unique and offers significant potential beyond what standard market analysis captures.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This reflects a fair value for both of us, allowing you to benefit from this opportunity while ensuring I receive a reasonable return on my investment.  What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,550,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  $1,275,000 is a bit too far off from what I believe this product is worth. However, I'm willing to keep working towards a solution. Let's split the difference.  I propose $1,412,500. This price reflects the product's unique value while remaining within a reasonable range for your budget.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. ",1412500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,412,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm offering $1,375,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget constraints.",1375000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $1,375,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a little more, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on this product's unique value.  Let's bridge the gap. I'm proposing a final price of $1,400,000. This is a realistic figure that takes your budget into account while also reflecting the product's true worth.  I'm confident this is our best chance to reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering $1,375,000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a 2-year warranty and a free maintenance package. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and provides a good deal for both of us.",1375000.0,Bob,8,
