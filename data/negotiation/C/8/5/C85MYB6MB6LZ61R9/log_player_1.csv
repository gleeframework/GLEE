"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's a good chance he'll accept this offer. If he rejects, I can then lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially securing a better deal. I'm also not desperate to sell, as I have the option to sell to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me, and it might be attractive enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects, I can continue to negotiate with him, but I'm aware that I have the backup option of selling to John if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate. I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'm not desperate to sell, as I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, so I can afford to be a bit more assertive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,000,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me and is closer to Bob's last offer. I'm hoping that this shows good faith and encourages Bob to meet me in the middle. If he rejects, I'm prepared to accept his previous offer of $900,000, but I'm aiming to see if we can find a solution that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum of $800,000. It's a good price for me, and it seems likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly higher offer. There's also the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with John's lower offer.  It's better to secure a deal now and avoid the risk of losing a sale completely."
