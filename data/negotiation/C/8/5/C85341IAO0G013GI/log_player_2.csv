Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175

$175 is still more than you are willing to pay, but Alice is showing some flexibility, so you'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still above my budget. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product, and that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're able to accept."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can sell the product to you for $125. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still determined to get a better price, and you're not quite ready to go with John's offer yet.  You'll try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's really my final offer. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $110, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $110, so I can offer it to you for $117.50. It's the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where further negotiation seems unlikely to get you a price lower than $100.  John's offer is a good deal, and you don't want to risk going over your budget."
