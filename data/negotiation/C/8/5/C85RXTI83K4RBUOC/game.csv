"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $850,000?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you consider $900,000? I feel like that's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  This would give us both a solid outcome. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to go up slightly. How about $910,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I think it reflects a fair price for both of us.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I'm looking for. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",925000.0,Alice,7,
