Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I'm looking for. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's make this deal happen.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is holding firm and we're running out of rounds. Accepting the $925,000 offer saves us $275,000 compared to John's price. It's unlikely Alice will drop significantly in the remaining rounds, and we risk pushing her away entirely.  This offer represents a good balance between getting a decent deal and ensuring we secure the product."
