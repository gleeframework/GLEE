"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to keep costs low, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. I can offer it to you for $1,180,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
