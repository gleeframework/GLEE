**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is very close to your desired price of $1,320,000.  While there's still a small difference, it's likely that continuing negotiations will only result in minor adjustments.  Considering the limited rounds remaining and the possibility that Alice might become less willing to negotiate, accepting this offer is the most strategic decision. This ensures you get the product at a significantly reduced price compared to John's offer and minimizes the risk of not securing the product within the allotted rounds."
