Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

You can still do better than $105, and you have several rounds left.  You can try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm happy to pay $100, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can offer it to you for $102.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $102.50, which is still a good deal for you as it's within your budget of $120 and you're saving a decent amount compared to John's offer. While you could try to negotiate further, it's risky given that Alice has stated this is her lowest price. Accepting her offer minimizes the risk of losing the product and ensures you get a good deal."
