"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1 million, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  It's important to start with a strong initial offer to gauge his interest and potentially establish a higher negotiation range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$500,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I hope to find a middle ground with Bob in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $600,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will continue to negotiate with him.  I still have time to get a better deal and I'm hoping he'll come up with a more reasonable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $850,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm still holding firm on a price above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a genuine attempt to reach a deal and will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$700,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm willing to continue exploring options with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm dropping my offer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that this is my final offer and agree to the deal.  If he rejects this offer, I will sell to John for $800,000 to guarantee myself a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm running out of time. I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale with John, especially since I've already lowered my price to my minimum.  It's better to secure the $800,000 than to continue negotiating and risk getting nothing at all."
