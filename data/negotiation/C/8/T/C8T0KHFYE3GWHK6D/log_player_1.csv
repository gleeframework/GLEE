{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a fair price, as it's less than what the product is worth to him, but still above my minimum value. This gives him an incentive to buy, while ensuring I get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for a higher price. Accepting his offer ensures I still make a decent profit."
