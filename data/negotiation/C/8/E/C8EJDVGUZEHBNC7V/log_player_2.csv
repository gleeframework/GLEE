"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's closer to your maximum budget of $15,000 than your ideal price point.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** If the negotiation with Alice fails, you can always purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:** Offering $12,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer gives Alice some space to come down a bit from her initial position. 
* **Highlights your budget:** The message reinforces your willingness to buy the product but emphasizes your financial constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:**  Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is a fair compromise. It's a significant decrease from her initial offer and within your budget.
* **Time is ticking:**  You've already rejected one offer and only have 7 rounds left. 
* **Risk vs. reward:**  While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and being forced to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price."
