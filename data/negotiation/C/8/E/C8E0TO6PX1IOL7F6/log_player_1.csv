Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  The $20,000 price gives you some room to negotiate down if Bob counter-offers.
* **It's a clear opening:** The message sets a positive tone and clearly communicates your initial asking price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It shows flexibility:** By stating ""I'm open to negotiation,"" you signal that you're willing to work with Bob to find a price that works for both parties. 

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest while still maintaining your target price. You can then adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $18000 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still worth pushing for a bit more.  Bob has shown interest, and by rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Signal your value:**  Rejecting his offer demonstrates that you believe the product is worth more than $18,000.
* **Potentially get a higher counteroffer:**  Bob might be willing to increase his offer slightly to secure the deal.
* **Maintain your negotiating power:**  By continuing the negotiation, you keep control of the process and have the opportunity to steer the price closer to your desired range.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob. A good counteroffer might be something like:

```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $18,000 is still a little below what I need to make this work. Would you consider $19,000?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $18,000 is still a little below what I need to make this work. Would you consider $19,000?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to lower your price but not by too much.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** It signals your willingness to find a compromise.
* **Offers a reasonable compromise:** $19,000 is a middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's offer.

This approach should encourage Bob to consider your counteroffer while still giving you some room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $19000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $17500 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,500 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still not ideal. You've already shown flexibility by lowering your price twice, and accepting Bob's offer at this point would leave you with a smaller profit margin.  

**Next Steps:**

It's worth sending a counteroffer to Bob, but it's important to be firm. You could say something like:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $17,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18,250.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."" ""product_price"": 18250}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows a willingness to compromise:** You're meeting Bob halfway.
* **Is firm:** It's your final offer, indicating that you're not willing to negotiate further.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** You're still trying to reach an agreement.

If Bob rejects this offer, you should seriously consider selling the product to John for $15,000.  You've already lowered your price significantly, and continuing to negotiate with Bob might not be worth the time and effort if you're not getting closer to your desired price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $17000 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob's offer is significantly below your desired price, and you've already made multiple concessions. While continuing to negotiate is a possibility, it's getting increasingly likely that you won't be able to achieve a price that meets your minimum requirements. 

Here's why selling to John is the best option:

* **Time is money:**  Negotiations can be time-consuming, and you've already spent several rounds with Bob. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Bob's offers have been consistently below your minimum, indicating he might not be willing to meet your price.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  John is a guaranteed buyer, and you're assured of receiving $15,000 for the product.

While $15,000 is your minimum, it's still better than risking further negotiation with Bob that might lead to no sale or a lower price. You've shown flexibility and tried to find a compromise, but it's time to secure a sale with John and move on."
