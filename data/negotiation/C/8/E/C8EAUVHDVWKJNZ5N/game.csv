Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think?,130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $110, which would be $120. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $120 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Can we meet at that price?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $118. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you halfway between $120 and $115, which would be $117.50. This is my final offer. What do you think?",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $114.50. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",114.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $116. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you halfway between $120 and $114.50, which would be $117.25. This is my final offer. What do you think?",117.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a final offer of $112.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",112.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $116. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you halfway between $120 and $112.50, which would be $116.25. This is my final offer. What do you think?",116.25,Alice,9,
