"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$400,000 is a very low price for a product, especially considering you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000. It's highly likely that Alice is undervaluing the product. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly higher than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise. If she rejects this offer, I'll have more information to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved up from her initial offer, but $650,000 is still a significant discount from my maximum budget. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $900,000. This is closer to Alice's most recent offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, it's still a significant amount below my maximum budget, leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly increasing her offer, but $750,000 is still significantly lower than my maximum budget. I believe I can negotiate a better price by continuing to counteroffer. I want to see if I can close the gap towards my previous offer of $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $850,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $900,000 and Alice's latest offer of $750,000. I'm getting closer to the middle ground, but still leaving space for further negotiation if needed. I believe this offer shows that I'm serious about buying the product while still prioritizing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally reached an offer that's reasonably close to my counteroffer. $800,000 is still a good deal, especially considering I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000. It's time to accept the offer and avoid risking further negotiation that might lead to a higher price. I don't want to push my luck too far and risk having to buy from John at a much higher price."
