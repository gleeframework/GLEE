Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and engaging, aiming to create a positive rapport with Bob.
* **Open Ended:** The question ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

I'm excited to see how the negotiation unfolds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Could you consider reducing the price by $20? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Test the Waters:**  See if Bob is truly willing to pay $80 or if he's just trying to lowball me.
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate my willingness to walk away, potentially making him more likely to increase his offer.

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, aiming for a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a little low for me right now. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $90. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $90, which is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (""split the difference""), making it sound more reasonable and less arbitrary.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and positive tone encourages Bob to continue negotiating.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more enticing to Bob and bring us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we negotiate at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. While it's lower than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. It's also a sign that Bob is serious about buying the product, and further negotiation might not be fruitful.  

Here's why accepting the offer is the best choice:

* **Close to Target:** $85 is only $5 away from my initial goal of $90.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate risks delaying the sale and potentially losing Bob as a buyer. 
* **John's Offer:** While I can sell to John for $80, Bob's offer is slightly better.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale that's close to my target price and avoiding the risk of losing both Bob and the opportunity to sell to John."
