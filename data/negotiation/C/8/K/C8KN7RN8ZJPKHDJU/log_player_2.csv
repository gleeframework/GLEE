"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You can do better than $140.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125. Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good value for you.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $135 is still a bit more than you'd like, it's a good compromise. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and you're only $15 away from your goal. It's worth taking the deal and avoiding the risk of further haggling."
