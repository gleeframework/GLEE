Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate the gesture, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
