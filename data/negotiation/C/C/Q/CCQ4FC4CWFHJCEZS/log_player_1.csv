Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves you some space for concessions if necessary.
* **It's a significant discount from John's offer:** This shows Bob that you're serious about selling to him. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you can adjust your next offer based on his counteroffer and his negotiating tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to take the deal as it's better than nothing, it's not a good long-term strategy.  

Here's why:

* **You're leaving too much money on the table:** You could potentially get much closer to your minimum if you negotiate further.
* **Setting a precedent for lowball offers:**  Accepting this low offer might encourage Bob to make even lower offers in the future.
* **You have a backup option:**  John is willing to pay your minimum price, so you're not under any pressure to accept Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

You should send Bob a counteroffer that's closer to your initial offer of $1,400,000. This will show him that you're serious about negotiating but still willing to compromise. You could try a price like $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,200,000? I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is your minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer means:

* **You achieve your goal:** You get the minimum you were willing to accept for the product.
* **You secure a sale:** You have a buyer who is committed to the deal.
* **You avoid further negotiation:**  You don't have to spend more time haggling with Bob.

While you could try to negotiate further and get closer to John's offer of $1,500,000, the risk is that Bob might walk away, leaving you with no sale.  It's better to secure the deal at your minimum price than to risk losing it completely."
