"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest in the product, but $1,300,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a strong offer for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
