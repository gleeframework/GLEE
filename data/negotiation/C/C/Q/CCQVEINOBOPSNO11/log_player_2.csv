"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its quality and features, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's in my best interest to reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum offer, hoping Alice might be willing to negotiate a bit. It's a significant drop from her initial offer, but I'm hoping she recognizes my serious interest and the fact that I'm willing to walk away if the price doesn't work."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite low for the value this product provides.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my budget.  I'm going to reject her offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  It's possible Alice is willing to negotiate further, especially since she's already reduced her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise. $12,000 is still within my budget, and it's a significant step closer to Alice's offer. I'm hoping she sees this as a sign of good faith and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter. I'm seeing a gap between what I need to make this worthwhile and what you're offering. I can go as low as $15,500, but that's my final offer. It's a great deal for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget and too close to the price John is offering. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can squeeze out a better deal. It's a risky move, but I'm hoping Alice is motivated to close the deal and will accept something closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $15,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. If we can close the deal at this price, I'm ready to move forward. If not, I may have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's just slightly above my maximum budget, showing my strong interest. This is a risky move as it's close to John's offer. However, Alice might be willing to accept this to avoid losing the deal altogether. The key is to show that I'm serious about buying and willing to pay a premium, but only within a reasonable range."
