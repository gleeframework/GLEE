Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but it also leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested in the product and we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it will be acceptable to him. I'm still confident I can get a better price than selling to John, but I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to keep negotiating, Bob's counteroffer of $13,050 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product. It's a good deal for both of us."
