Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,800,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
