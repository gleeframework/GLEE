"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,800,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite low considering the value this product brings.  I could meet you halfway at $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
