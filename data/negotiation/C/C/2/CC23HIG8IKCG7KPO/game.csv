"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product is great, but your asking price is a little high for me. Would you consider selling it for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $9,750? That would work much better for me.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,750 is still a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,250. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
