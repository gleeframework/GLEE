"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable at an exceptional value. Considering its worth to us and its potential value to you, I propose a price of $95 for it. This price reflects the quality and benefits we believe you'll appreciate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
Alice's starting offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price.  We'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $95 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $65 for it."",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

We're starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's to leave room for negotiation. This strategy aims to bring the price closer to our ideal range while still allowing for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a middle ground that works for both of us. Considering your budget and the value you place on the product, I am willing to consider $75 for it. This price still allows us to maintain a fair transaction while making the product more accessible to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming to get closer to our $80 maximum. We'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the adjusted offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $70? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We're inching closer to our maximum price while still leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see if Alice agrees to this offer."
