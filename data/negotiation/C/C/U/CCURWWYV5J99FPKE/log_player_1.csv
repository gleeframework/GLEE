Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, still landing Alice a great deal. 
* **Above Minimum:** This price is significantly above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($10,000) ensuring a good profit.

By starting the negotiation with a strong but reasonable offer, Alice increases her chances of maximizing her profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
