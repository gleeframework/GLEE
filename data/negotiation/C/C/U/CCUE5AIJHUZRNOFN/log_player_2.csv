"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product for $11,000. I know you'll find great value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a decent price, he can likely get it for less.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,250 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still do better. He is willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $8,000, so there is still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get closer to $9,500 before giving up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,875?  This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9875} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,875 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for something a bit higher.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's final offer:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer, and rejecting it risks further negotiation.
* **Potential cost:**  While Bob could attempt to negotiate further, the risk of reaching an impasse and having to buy from John at $12,000 is significant.
* **Saving money:**  $10,000 is still a good price compared to John's offer, saving Bob $2,000.

It's a calculated risk, but accepting Alice's offer at $10,000 seems like the most sensible choice at this point in the negotiation."
