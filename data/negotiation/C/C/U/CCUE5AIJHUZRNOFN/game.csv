"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,875?  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",9875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,875 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for something a bit higher.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000? This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
