Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low and we can likely get a better price. We'll see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer of $10,500. While it's closer to my budget, I still can't commit to that price. I would like to propose $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is $10,000. This is just slightly less than what I'm willing to accept and it is still a good price for me. It's unlikely I'll get a higher offer from Bob, and selling to John for $12,000 isn't worth the risk of losing a deal. I'll accept Bob's offer."
