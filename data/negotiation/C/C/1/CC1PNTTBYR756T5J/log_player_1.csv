{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's value but below my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counter-offers, while still giving him an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $120? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $120 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to pay $110, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop that low.  I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $150, so I'm going to accept that offer instead."
