"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  $110 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90.  This is a fair price that gives you a good margin and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,4,
