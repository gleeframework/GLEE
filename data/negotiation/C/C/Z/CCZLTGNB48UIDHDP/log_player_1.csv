Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's really valuable to me. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $110, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to me can subtly influence Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to discuss the offer. This keeps the negotiation flowing.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a sale above my minimum.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter with a lower price, or walk away and sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $65. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While I could sell to John for $100, there's still potential for a better price with Bob. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can find a compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I will now send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that's still above my minimum but more realistic given Bob's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've reduced my price from $110 to $90, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm still reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify my price.
* **Open-Ended:** The message invites Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a sale at a price close to my minimum.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll have to decide whether to accept his counteroffer if he makes one, or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of losing John:** While $75 is better than nothing, I'm hesitant to risk losing John who is willing to pay $100.
* **Counteroffer potential:**  There's still room for negotiation with Bob. I believe I can get a higher price by counteroffering again. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price closer to $90, seeing if I can meet Bob's budget while staying within my price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $85?  That's a fair compromise considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering $85, which is halfway between my last offer of $90 and Bob's offer of $75. This demonstrates a genuine willingness to find common ground.
* **Value reminder:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my price and maintain leverage. 
* **Finality:**  I'm starting to signal that this might be my final offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a sale at a price slightly below my ideal, but still above my minimum. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll have to decide whether to accept his counteroffer if he makes one, or sell to John for $100."
