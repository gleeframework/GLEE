{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000:
    * Gives Bob a significant discount ($50,000) compared to its worth to him.
    * Earns you a $150,000 profit above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring a sale at a price exceeding your minimum."
