,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $120. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
