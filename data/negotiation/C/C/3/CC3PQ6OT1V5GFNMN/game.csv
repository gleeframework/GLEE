"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product.  To kick off negotiations, I'm suggesting a price of $950,000.  I believe this reflects the significant value it will bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product considering its value to my business.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the product's true worth.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the full value. Would you consider $887,500?",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $887,500 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $882,500, which is my final offer. If you can meet me there, I'll be happy to do business with you.",882500.0,Bob,6,
