I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150 if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $145 is still a decent price, I'm hoping I can get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
``` 

I'm coming down slightly from my original price, but I'm still holding out for a good deal. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering he originally offered $145."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's higher than what I'd get from John and only slightly below my initial offer.  It's worth closing the deal now to avoid further negotiation."
