"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, and I value your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,000,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,000,000. I'd like to propose a compromise at $950,000. I think this price is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying, and it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and see you're serious about this product.  To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept that price, but only if you can assure me this is your final offer.  Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll need to explore other options.",950000.0,Alice,5,
