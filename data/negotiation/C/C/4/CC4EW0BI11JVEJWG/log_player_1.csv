Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Given my budget, I would like to counter with an offer of $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your asking price.

Explanation:  Bob is holding firm at his maximum price of $100.  There's no point in further negotiation as it's unlikely he'll budge. Since John offers the same amount, it's better to cut our losses and move on to a guaranteed sale."
