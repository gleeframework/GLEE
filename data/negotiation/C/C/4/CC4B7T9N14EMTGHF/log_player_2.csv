Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18,000 and $12,000, so I'll sell the product to you for $15,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

**Reasoning:**  Alice seems firm at $15,000.  While she might come down a little more, it's unlikely she'll go as low as $8,000, which is the price John is offering. It's not worth risking further negotiation when you have a guaranteed option at your target price."
