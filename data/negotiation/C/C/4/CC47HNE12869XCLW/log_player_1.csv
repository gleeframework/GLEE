"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum value:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $8,000, so this gives me some room to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows I'm confident in the product's value and am serious about getting a good price.
* **It encourages Bob to counteroffer:**  This keeps the negotiation going and allows me to gauge his interest.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm still hopeful that we can get closer to my initial asking price. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet him halfway, but also that I still value the product highly. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to agree to a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,200.  While it's still a bit lower than I initially hoped for, it's close enough to my minimum value and a good compromise.  It's better than risking further negotiation and possibly ending up with the lower price from John."
