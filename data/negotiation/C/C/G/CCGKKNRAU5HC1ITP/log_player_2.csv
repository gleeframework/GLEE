# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $120 for this exceptional item. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the high quality and utility that I know you'll appreciate. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $120.**  This is less than the $150 you'd pay John.
* **You want to save money.**  Accepting Alice's offer means you save $30.
* **Buying from John is your fallback option.**  You'll only go to John if you can't get a better deal."
