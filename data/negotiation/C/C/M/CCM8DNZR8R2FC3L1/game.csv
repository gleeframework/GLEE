"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $180. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",180.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $180 is closer to what I was hoping for, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about $190?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",190.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $190 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $180 to $190, so I'm thinking $185. Can you consider that?",185.0,Bob,4,
