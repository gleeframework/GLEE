"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $180. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $190 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $180 to $190, so I'm thinking $185. Can you consider that?
