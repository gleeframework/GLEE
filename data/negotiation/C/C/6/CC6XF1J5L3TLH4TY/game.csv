"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit too high for me though. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $115 is still a bit too steep for me.  I could go up to $70.  What do you say?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $70 is simply too far below what I can accept. If you're really interested, I'd be willing to go down to $100, but that's the lowest I can go. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
