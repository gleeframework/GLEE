Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a significant step away from my initial ask.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,025,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards our desired price point, but we still have room to negotiate. Accepting $975,000 would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table.  We'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. While $975,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price.  Let's settle at $1,000,000. This offer reflects the product's value while recognizing your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $975,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob seems stuck at $975,000 and is unlikely to move significantly higher. We've reached a point where the potential gains from continuing negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the certainty of selling to John for $1,200,000.  It makes the most business sense to secure the guaranteed profit at this point."
