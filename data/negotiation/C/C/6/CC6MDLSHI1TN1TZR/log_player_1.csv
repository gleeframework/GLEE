Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,350,000.  This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:** You have a strong fallback option with John ($1,500,000), ensuring you won't settle for anything less.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Starting at $1,350,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate up, getting you closer to your ideal price.
* **Creating urgency:** The 24-hour limit encourages Bob to act quickly and prevents him from shopping around too much.

**Why this strategy?**

This offer aims to strike a balance:

* **Maximize profit:** We want to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible. 
* **Secure the deal:** We need to make the offer enticing enough for Bob to accept, knowing he values the product at $1,200,000.

By offering a price significantly lower than your backup offer but still above Bob's valuation, you create a win-win scenario where Bob feels like he's getting a good deal, and you still profit handsomely."
