"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  I'm sure you'll find it a great investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's common in negotiations to start with a price higher than your absolute minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down. 
* **Strong Value Proposition:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and frames it as an investment opportunity. This can help pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open Ended:**  Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and keeps the conversation flowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $800,000 is your minimum, you have 8 rounds left and Bob has shown interest. There's a chance you can negotiate a higher price. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial asking price, potentially enticing him further. 
* **Avoiding Premature Sale:**  Selling to John immediately would guarantee $800,000, but it's too early to give up on potentially getting more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit low considering the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is still a great deal, and I believe it's fair given the unique benefits this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  The counteroffer of $900,000 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and your previous offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  The message highlights the value of the product, subtly reminding Bob why it's worth paying more.
* **Focus on Common Ground:**  The language emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution.  This sets a positive tone for continued negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the Negotiation:**  Even though Bob is getting closer to your minimum, you still have 6 rounds left. There's a chance you can get closer to your desired price of $900,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and his offers are increasing. This indicates he values the product and may be willing to pay more.
* **Avoiding Premature Sale:**  Selling to John would guarantee $800,000, but there's a chance of getting a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This would ensure a fair price for both of us and allow me to move forward with the sale.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise and meet Bob halfway. It indicates a desire to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Focusing on Fairness:**  The message frames the offer as a fair solution for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Encouraging a Quick Resolution:**  By suggesting a split and asking for Bob's opinion, this counteroffer encourages a swift decision and reduces the chances of further back and forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $825000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, you only have 4 rounds left. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's willingness to negotiate, combined with the limited rounds, makes it reasonable to hope for a higher price. You've come down considerably, but there's still room for a slight increase.
* **Avoiding Premature Sale:** Selling to John now would guarantee $800,000, but you have a chance to get a better deal with Bob. It's worth risking a few more rounds to try and secure a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  If you're serious about acquiring it, I'm ready to finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a small compromise, aiming to meet Bob halfway again. It shows a willingness to end the negotiations but still aims for a price higher than your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message conveys a sense of finality, suggesting a willingness to close the deal at this price but leaving room for Bob to consider his options.
* **Focusing on Value:** The message subtly reinforces the value of the product, reminding Bob of its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $825000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:**  We are down to two rounds left and Bob's offer hasn't moved much. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:** There is a significant risk that Bob will continue to counteroffer at $825,000, potentially leading to a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed Minimum:**  Selling to John guarantees a minimum price of $800,000, which is acceptable considering the limited time left. It's better to secure a guaranteed amount than risk getting nothing.
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:** While there is a chance Bob might accept $850,000, it's too risky to gamble with just two rounds left.

Given the limited time and the potential for stalemate, it's strategically sound to sell to John and ensure a guaranteed return."
