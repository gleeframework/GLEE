"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to your business, potentially even more so than mine. Given its potential, I'm asking for $950,000.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $950,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business.",875000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and meeting me in the middle. However, I believe the true value of this product is much closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This is my final offer.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but $925,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'd like to make a final offer to you. Can you consider it?",900000.0,Bob,4,
