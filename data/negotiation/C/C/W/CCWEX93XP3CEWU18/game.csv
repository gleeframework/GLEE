"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, my budget for this purchase is $800000.

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate further. Considering the value of the product, I propose a revised price of $875000. This still represents a significant discount compared to the original price, while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $875000 is still slightly above my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $837500?  This would represent a substantial savings for me while allowing you to still receive a fair price. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",837500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but  $862500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement if we continue to work together.  I'm willing to go up to $825000.  This offer reflects the value I see in your product while still allowing me to stay within my budget constraints.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",825000.0,Bob,6,

This still represents a fair return for us, while also being within your budget. I hope this proposal will lead to a successful conclusion of our negotiations.",850000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. To make this work, I need to stay at or below $825000.  I'm really eager to work with you on this, but my budget is simply not going to allow for a higher price.  Could we explore a final compromise at that level?",825000.0,Bob,8,

,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $840000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident this product holds value, and I'm ready to make a final offer of $825000. This price represents a significant compromise for me, and I sincerely hope you can consider it. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",825000.0,Bob,10,
