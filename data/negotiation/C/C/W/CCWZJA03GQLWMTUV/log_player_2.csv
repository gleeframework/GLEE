"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  As Bob, you're aiming to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $16,000.  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product offers significant value beyond $16,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his target price of $15,000. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to continue trying to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $18,000.  Considering the value I place on this product and my budget, I'm willing to pay $17,000.  This represents a good compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 17000}
