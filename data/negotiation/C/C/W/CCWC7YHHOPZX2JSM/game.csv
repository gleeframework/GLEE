"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. I can offer it to you for $790000, but that's as low as I can go.

"I'm getting close to the end of my rope, Bob. I've already gone as low as I can go. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $795000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away and sell the product to someone else. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,9,
