```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much and is still well above my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we'll run out of rounds without a deal.  To ensure I get the product, it's best to go with John's offer at $8,000.  This guarantees I get the product within my budget."
