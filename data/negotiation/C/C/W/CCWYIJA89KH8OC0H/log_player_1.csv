Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob is likely to consider it, as it's still a good deal for him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space to go higher if Bob is willing, and to go lower if you need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $100 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is still above your minimum of $80 and leaves you with a good profit. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $80. It's also important to consider that you might not get a better offer in the next round."
