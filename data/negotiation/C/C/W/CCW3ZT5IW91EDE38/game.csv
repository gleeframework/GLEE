"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. We believe it's a game-changer and would be a great addition to your portfolio. As we're open to negotiations, I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. Given my valuation and the need to ensure a profitable acquisition, I'd like to offer $750,000. This represents a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. I'm open to discussing further, but this is the best I can do at this time.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product can bring significant value to your business. Considering your offer of $750,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This price still reflects the product's true value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still above my maximum.  Considering the potential value to me and the need for a reasonable profit margin, I can offer $850,000. This is a significant step towards meeting your needs while still allowing me to make a worthwhile investment. I'm eager to finalize this deal, but this is my final offer.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between value and profit, but I'm still not willing to compromise on the product's value. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of $900,000. This price is closer to your offer, but still reflects the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to sacrifice the product's value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
