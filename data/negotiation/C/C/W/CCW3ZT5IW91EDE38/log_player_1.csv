Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. Given my valuation and the need to ensure a profitable acquisition, I'd like to offer $750,000. This represents a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. I'm open to discussing further, but this is the best I can do at this time.
