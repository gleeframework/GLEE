"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I've assessed its worth to be at least $1,000,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price of $1,250,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let me know your thoughts. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $1,000,000.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
