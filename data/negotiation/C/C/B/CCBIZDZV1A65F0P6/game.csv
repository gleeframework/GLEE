"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
