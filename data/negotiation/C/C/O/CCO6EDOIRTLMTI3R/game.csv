"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high, but I was hoping to negotiate a price closer to $8,000. I appreciate your time and consideration.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This gives you a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would it be possible for you to lower the price further? I am looking to stay within my budget of $8,000.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'd love to work with you, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant discount from my previous offer, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise I'll have to look at other options.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer of $9,000, but I'm still not able to meet that price. I'm hoping to stay within my budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for you to consider this request?",8750.0,Bob,6,
