"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you consider meeting me halfway at $17,000? I'm open to discussing further.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we try to find a compromise closer to the middle ground? Would you consider $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
