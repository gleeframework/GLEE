"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we discuss a price of $9250?",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and the value I place on this product, I would like to propose a price of $9000.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $9250 again, but this time I'll throw in a small premium service that's worth $250, making the total value $9500?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While I appreciate the additional service, I still feel that $9000 is a fair price for the product alone. I would like to stick with that amount if possible.",9000.0,Bob,6,
