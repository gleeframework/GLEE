{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's really valuable to me. I'd be happy to offer it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price of $100 but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to Bob's $150 value as possible without risking him going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than John's offer, I'm not ready to close the deal yet. I believe I can do better than that. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your interest. While $105 is a good starting point, I'm hoping to get closer to $120.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway? "", ""product_price"": 112} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice. How about we settle at $110? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's a fair price that's close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk pushing him away and losing the sale to John."
