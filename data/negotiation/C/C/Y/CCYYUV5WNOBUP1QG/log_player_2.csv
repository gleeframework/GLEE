"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Polite and interested:** Keeps the negotiation going in a positive direction.
* **Significant jump down:**  Aims to move the price closer to my target range quickly.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** I'm willing to go up, but I want to see Alice's response first."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good. However,  $8,500 is still closer to her desired price than mine. I'll counter to try and get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice. How about we settle on $8,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Direct and assertive:** I'm stating my desired price clearly now.
* **Still polite:** Maintaining a good negotiating relationship is important.
* **Potentially her bottom line:** This might be the price where she accepts, as it's likely her value point. 
* **Alternative is known:**  I'm okay with walking away if she doesn't accept, knowing I have John's offer."
