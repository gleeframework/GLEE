"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you, which I believe perfectly aligns with your needs and expectations. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that the product holds a significant importance for me, reflecting its true worth at $15,000. However, considering your appreciation for the product, I propose an offer that I hope will be mutually beneficial. For you, the price would be set at $12,000, allowing you to secure this remarkable item at a favorable rate while ensuring a fair return for us. I look forward to your consideration and the opportunity to discuss further if needed. Thank you for your time and interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or proceeding to buy from John at your maximum budget."
