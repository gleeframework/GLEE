"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique and highly sought-after item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You want to save as much money as possible.  Alice's first offer is above your target of $1,200,000.  It's best to try and negotiate down to a better price before you commit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm happy to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is right at your target price. While you might be able to push for a bit lower, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential for a small discount.  Accepting the offer is the best strategy here."
