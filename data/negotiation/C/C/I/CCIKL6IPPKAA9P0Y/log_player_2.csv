"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You're trying to save money, and Alice's offer is too high.  Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $7,500 is still within my budget, and hopefully, it's low enough to incentivize her to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low. How about $8,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I'm still trying to save as much money as possible. I'll reject her offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. $8,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $8,000.  I'm really interested in the product, and this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
``` 
 
I'm proposing a price of $8,000, which is right at my budget. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for Alice to accept."
