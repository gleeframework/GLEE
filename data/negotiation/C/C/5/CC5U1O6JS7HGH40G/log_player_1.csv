Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $125, Bob might still find the product a good deal, even if it's not the absolute best price.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You're willing to negotiate but still making a profit.
* **It opens the door for counteroffers:** This encourages Bob to participate in the negotiation and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price. 

Let me know how the negotiation goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That product looks great, but $125 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, $80 is simply too low. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows you're willing to negotiate but not willing to drastically lower your price.
* **It's still profitable for you:**  $100 is above your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's a reasonable compromise:** This shows you're open to finding a solution that works for both of you."
