"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get as close to my target budget as possible. Let me know what you think!",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $10,800 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle on $11,000? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,950. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",10950.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $10,950 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I'd like to propose $11,200. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $11,100. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in the product. Let me know what you think!",11100.0,Bob,6,
