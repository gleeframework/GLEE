"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $140. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $140 is still a bit more than I had budgeted for this. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get for the product, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm willing to meet you at $130, which is still a great price for the value you'll get from the product. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make it work.",130.0,Alice,5,
