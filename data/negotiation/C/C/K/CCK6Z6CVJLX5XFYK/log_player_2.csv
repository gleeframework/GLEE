"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $160. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get a price closer to your $120 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it establishes a negotiation floor. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This leaves ample room to negotiate upwards towards your $120 limit.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message maintains a polite and friendly tone, suggesting you're serious about purchasing but need a more agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $160 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $140. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above your $120 limit. There's room to negotiate further and get closer to your target price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $140 is still a bit more than I had budgeted for this. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and to the Point:**  You're directly stating your desired price, which is also your absolute limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying this is ""more than budgeted,"" it subtly implies you might walk away if the price doesn't work.
* **Compromise:** By saying ""meet in the middle,"" you're acknowledging her compromise while firmly pushing for your ideal price.

Now it's up to Alice. This counteroffer will likely lead to one of three outcomes:
* **Alice accepts:** You get the product at your ideal price.
* **Alice counters:**  The negotiation continues, but you know her bottom line is likely close to $120. 
* **Alice refuses:** You can then decide if it's worth going slightly above $120 or going with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get for the product, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm willing to meet you at $130, which is still a great price for the value you'll get from the product. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice is only $10 above your target price. This is a good compromise, especially considering you've already negotiated her down significantly.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly better price, but it also risks Alice walking away. It's unlikely you'll find the product for much less elsewhere.
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now saves you time and potential back-and-forth in the negotiation."
