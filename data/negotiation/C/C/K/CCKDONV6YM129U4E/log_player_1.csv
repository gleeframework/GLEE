Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's the strategy Alice should employ, followed by the offer:

**Strategy**

Alice has a strong fallback position with John, guaranteeing her the full value of the product ($1,500,000). This allows her to aim high with Bob, knowing she has nothing to lose.  The optimal strategy is to offer a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know you see its value, so I'm proposing a price of $1,195,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it at a price well below market value. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1195000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Target:** Alice aims for a price close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation.
* **Slight Discount:** By offering a small discount ($5,000), Alice makes the offer psychologically more appealing.  Bob sees he's getting a ""deal.""
* **Confident Language:** The message avoids sounding desperate and instead positions the offer as valuable. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate further. Alice needs to be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price close to her $1,500,000 minimum."
