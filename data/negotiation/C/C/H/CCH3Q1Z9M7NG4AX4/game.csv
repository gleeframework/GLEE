"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This reflects the product's true value while still offering you a good deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $775,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a smart financial decision.",775000.0,Bob,4,
