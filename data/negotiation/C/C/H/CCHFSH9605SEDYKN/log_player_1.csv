Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.  I'm asking for $1,700,000."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer palatable to Bob:

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product's value to Bob matches your minimum, there's room to negotiate upwards. A high starting price leaves space for Bob to feel like he's getting a ""deal"" if he negotiates you down a bit.
* **Justification of Value:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value (""significant value,"" ""well worth the investment"") to reinforce its worth in Bob's mind.
* **No Ultimatum:** The message avoids any language about this being Bob's only chance.  It keeps the tone collaborative rather than pressuring, increasing the likelihood of a counter-offer rather than an outright rejection.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, it's still ideal to secure a deal with Bob.  Negotiation allows for potentially exceeding your minimum price."
