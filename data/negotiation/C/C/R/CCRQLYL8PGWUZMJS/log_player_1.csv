Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,500. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be more reasonable for me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $12,500.  While I could push for more, there's a risk he walks away. Accepting his offer guarantees a profit of $2,500, which is a decent outcome.  The potential gain from further negotiation is likely small and not worth the risk of losing him as a buyer entirely."
