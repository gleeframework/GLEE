Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $800,000.

```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has made it clear she won't go below $850,000.  You've been firm with your $800,000 maximum. There's no point in further negotiation. Buying from John at your target price is the best move."
