"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is my final counteroffer, so I'd appreciate it if you could consider it seriously.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, my budget caps out at $800,000.  If you're willing to work within that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $800,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $850,000. This is my last offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could consider it seriously.",850000.0,Alice,5,
