"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this incredible product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob.  It saves him $300,000 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee of success, and the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
