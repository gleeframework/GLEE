"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**  Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, accepting Alice's offer of $900,000 is not a good deal.  Rejecting the offer and negotiating allows Bob to try and get a better price.  Buying from John is always an option, but Bob is trying to save money and should explore negotiating with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm only willing to pay $750,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850000 to facilitate this sale.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**  While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his maximum value.  Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try $800,000.  This price is fair, considering the value of the product to me, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 800000}
