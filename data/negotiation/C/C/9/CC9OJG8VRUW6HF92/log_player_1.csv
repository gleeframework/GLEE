Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us, hoping to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good price.
* **Confidence:**  I'm expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob, which can be persuasive.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If negotiations stall or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll move to John, who's willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** Even though I could sell to John immediately for $15,000, there's still a chance I can get closer to that price by continuing negotiations with Bob.
* **Room for compromise:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, he expressed interest in the product, indicating there's potential for us to find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $10,000 and $11,000, trying to find a price that is both acceptable to him and benefits me."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500?  This price still gives you a good deal while allowing me to cover my costs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget limitations while also showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Middle ground:** $10,500 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" for Bob, hoping to make him feel like he's getting a fair price.

**Next Steps:**

*  I'll closely watch Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
*  If he accepts, we'll finalize the deal. 
*  If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or to switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm not desperate to sell. John is waiting with a higher offer. 
* **Testing the limits:** I want to see if I can push Bob a little further. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $11,000. 
* If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be at $11,000 to make this deal worthwhile. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down slightly from my previous offer, but I'm sticking to a price that is still within my acceptable range.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value and my confidence in Bob's satisfaction, hoping to encourage him to accept.
* **Urgency:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by mentioning ""closing the deal"", implying that I'm prepared to walk away if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll be happy to finalize the deal.
* If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $15,000.  While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price, the negotiation seems to be stalling, and John is a reliable alternative."
