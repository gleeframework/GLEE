Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $1,000 if Bob accepts your offer.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $14,000 is a reasonable markup from Bob's perceived value of $12,000. It leaves room for negotiation but still aims for a significant profit.
* **Alternative Secured:**  You have the safety net of John's offer, so you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
