"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 120} 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a good middle ground, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I can still aim for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering $100. It's still a good price for Bob, considering his valuation, and it's closer to my target than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to close the deal closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering $95. It's a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer. Hopefully, this will be a good enough price for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly low.  Since I can sell the product to John for the same price Bob is offering, it's better to secure the sale with John and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
