Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  trying to get a higher price from Bob is worthwhile.
* **High but Reasonable:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for him to see potential profit if he can leverage the product effectively.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning another buyer (John), you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics. If you know he's a tough negotiator, you might adjust your initial price slightly lower.
* **Relationship Building:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might offer a slightly lower price, demonstrating a willingness to make the deal mutually beneficial."
