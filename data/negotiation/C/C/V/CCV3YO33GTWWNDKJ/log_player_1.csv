Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $119."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, which is what John will pay.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $80. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering it at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still aiming for a price very close to your guaranteed sale price. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept any offer above $80. This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still having a high chance of a successful sale."
