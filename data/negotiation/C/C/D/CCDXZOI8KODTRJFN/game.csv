"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering the value it holds for me and allows for a profitable margin for you.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This price still reflects a significant profit for me, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
