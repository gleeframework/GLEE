"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I'm looking for $180 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price you're willing to pay, so it's best to go with John's offer of $80."
