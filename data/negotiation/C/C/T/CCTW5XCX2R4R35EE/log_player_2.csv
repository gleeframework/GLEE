"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering $135.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is willing to sell for $120, offering $125 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This leaves room for compromise while still getting a better price than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price, but it's closer to what you're willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price in the next round.  There are still 7 rounds left before you have to resort to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price with her last offer. This counteroffer meets her halfway, offering a compromise that's likely more appealing than her previous offer.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is worse than her previous one, and it's getting closer to John's price.  There's still time to negotiate a better deal with Alice. You're still $5 below your maximum, and she has a lower floor, so there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, making it less attractive. However, we can still try to meet her halfway to secure a deal. We can offer $135, which is still within our budget and might incentivize her to accept.  It's a reasonable compromise considering the remaining rounds and the potential of having to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now equal to John's price.  There's no benefit to continuing negotiations, and we're now running out of time.  Buying from John guarantees we get the product for our maximum price. It's better to secure the product now than risk Alice continuing to increase her price or further delaying the deal."
