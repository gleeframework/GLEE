"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair value for both of us, allowing you a good profit while still providing me with a reasonable price.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $850,000. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This would allow us both to walk away happy with the deal. Let's try to meet in the middle and finalize this transaction.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $875,000, which would be $887,500. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
