Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

We're still a ways away from a price I'm comfortable with.  It's time to encourage Bob to make a bigger jump or seriously consider John's offer."

Bob is unwilling to budge significantly and is playing a tough game.  While we could continue negotiating and potentially squeeze a bit more out of him, it's not worth risking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  It's time to move on and finalize the deal with John."
