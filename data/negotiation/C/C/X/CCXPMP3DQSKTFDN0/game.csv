"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but our offers are still quite far apart. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price.  I'm willing to let this go for $1,000,000, but that's my absolute best. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,,

"I understand that you have another buyer interested, but I'm still not willing to meet the price of $1,000,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $980,000.
