"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

It's still beneficial to negotiate further. Alice is coming down, and we're getting closer to a price that's significantly better than John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $875,000 is still too far off from what I need.  Let's split the difference between our last offers. How about $912,500? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both come closer to our desired prices.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500

Alice is negotiating fairly by splitting the difference.  At $912,500, we're saving a significant amount compared to John's offer, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield much more savings."
