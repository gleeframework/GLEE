,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $875,000 is still too far off from what I need.  Let's split the difference between our last offers. How about $912,500? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both come closer to our desired prices.  What do you say?",912500.0,Alice,5,
