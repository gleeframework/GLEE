# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. I am offering this exceptional item to you for $9,500, considering its worth to you and my desire to ensure you receive a fair deal. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is above your maximum budget and also significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or simply buy from John at a lower cost."
