"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and still above what I need to receive.  Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? I'm sure we can find common ground at this price, and it's still a great deal for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $925,000? That's the best I can do at this point.",925000.0,Bob,4,
