"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Selling to John immediately guarantees me my desired price, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my limit. How about we meet at $8750? This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still not within my acceptable range. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price in the next round. Selling to John immediately guarantees me my desired price, but I'm willing to take a risk and continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $9,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for me.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $9000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8750 and $9000. How about we try $8875? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,875 is closer to my target price than previous offers, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I have several rounds remaining and believe I can push for a higher price with Bob.  I'm also wary of accepting a price that is significantly below my desired price, as it could set a precedent for future negotiations. Selling to John would guarantee my desired price, but I am willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob in the hopes of a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,875 is still too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't drop below $9,000.

I'm hoping we can come to an agreement, as I'm confident this product will be of great benefit to you."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm afraid I've reached the limit of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500, which is the maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at the end of the negotiation, and Bob has returned to his original offer of $8,500. This price is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'm disappointed to not have reached a mutually agreeable price with Bob, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with an even lower price.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $12,000."
