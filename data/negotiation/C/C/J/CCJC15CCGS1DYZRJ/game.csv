"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $9250? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for me. Let me know your thoughts.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my limit. How about we meet at $8750? This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $9000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for me.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $9000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8750 and $9000. How about we try $8875? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8875 is still too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't drop below $9000. This price is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows me to earn a reasonable profit. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement, as I'm confident this product will be of great benefit to you.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm afraid I've reached the limit of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500, which is the maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,8,
