"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum price of $1,000,000. You can do better by negotiating with Alice.  You have ten rounds, so you have time to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is higher than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price range, you still have several rounds left to negotiate. You can likely get a slightly lower price by making another counteroffer. Remember, you're aiming to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $860,000. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to reduce the price to $870,000. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value to me. I believe this is a fair compromise and would like to move forward with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your target price, but you're getting closer. It's risky to buy from John right now because you could potentially get a better deal with Alice. With 5 rounds remaining, you have time to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  $865,000 is my final offer. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to me and the fact that you can get the product to John for $1,000,000.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 865000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $875,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at this point, but I'm not willing to go further. Let's see if we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has clearly reached her bottom line. You have only three rounds remaining, and it is unlikely that Alice will budge further. You can save $125,000 by accepting Alice's offer compared to buying from John. While you might be able to get a slightly lower price with further negotiation, the risk of not reaching a deal and having to buy from John for a higher price is too high. It's a good compromise to secure the product and avoid further risk."
