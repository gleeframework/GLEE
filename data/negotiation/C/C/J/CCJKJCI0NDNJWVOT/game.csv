"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is higher than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $860,000. Let's close this deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to reduce the price to $870,000. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value to me. I believe this is a fair compromise and would like to move forward with this offer.",870000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  $865,000 is my final offer. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to me and the fact that you can get the product to John for $1,000,000.  Let's close this deal.",865000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $875,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at this point, but I'm not willing to go further. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",875000.0,Alice,7,
