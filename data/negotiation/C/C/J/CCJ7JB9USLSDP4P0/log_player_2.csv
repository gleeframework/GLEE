Alice's offer:

```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems stuck at a price point that doesn't benefit you. She's gone up from $115 to $120, even with the mention of ""extras.""  This suggests she's unlikely to significantly lower the price. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $150.  You'll save yourself further negotiation and potential frustration."
