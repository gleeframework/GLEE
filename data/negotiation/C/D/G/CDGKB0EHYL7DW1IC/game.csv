"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Considering the value we've both agreed upon, I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the worth of the product to you and the value I'm bringing to the table. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $862,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could close this quickly.",862500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $880,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",880000.0,Alice,5,
