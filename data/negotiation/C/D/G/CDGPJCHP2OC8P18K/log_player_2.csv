"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation and gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My offer is closer to my target price, but still leaves room for me to potentially meet Alice somewhere in the middle if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle somewhat? I propose $1,900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved considerably from her initial price, $1,900,000 is still above your $1,500,000 limit. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice meeting in the middle suggests she's open to further negotiation. You can likely get a better deal by countering again.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  You have the fallback option of buying from John at $1,500,000, which gives you leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,300,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Again):** This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to move towards her price point while still aiming for a price below my budget.
* **Strategic Concessions:** By moving up $300,000, I'm making a significant jump to signal my interest while still leaving room for some final adjustments.
* **Pressure and Urgency:** With each round, I'm subtly reminding Alice that I have the option to walk away and buy from John, potentially pushing her towards a more agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,300,000 is pushing it. How about we split the difference and call it $1,600,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, signaling she is unlikely to move significantly from this price.
* **Above Budget:** Even with her concession, the price of $1,600,000 is still $100,000 above your maximum budget.
* **John's Offer is Better:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,500,000, saving you money.

While you were close to a deal with Alice, accepting a price above your budget isn't worthwhile when you have a better alternative readily available."
