"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $22,000.  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $22,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value that goes beyond its price tag. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering my budget constraints, and it gives you a decent profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  To be fair to both of us, I propose $16,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're making progress. I'm still committed to buying this product, but I can only go up to $12,000. This is a fair compromise given our previous discussions.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,6,
