"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $22,000.  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $22,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value that goes beyond its price tag. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering my budget constraints, and it gives you a decent profit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  To be fair to both of us, I propose $16,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're making progress. I'm still committed to buying this product, but I can only go up to $12,000. This is a fair compromise given our previous discussions.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $15,000 mark. Accepting $12,000 is a $3,000 loss compared to John's offer. It's time to cut negotiations short and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
