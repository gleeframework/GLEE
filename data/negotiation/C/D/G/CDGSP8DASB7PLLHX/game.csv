Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a game-changer in its industry and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $20000. What do you think?,20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $17000. Can you meet me in the middle?",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $17000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. How about $19000?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $19000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $18000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $18000?",18000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your constraints, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I still need to make a decent profit. How about we meet at $18500? It's a small increase, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $18000, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further. Can you meet me at $18000?",18000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $18200? It's a small increase, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",18200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $18200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $18000, and that's my final offer. Can you meet me at $18000?",18000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on your offer, Bob. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet at $18100? It's a small increase, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",18100.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go any higher than $18000. I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at $18000?,18000.0,Bob,10,
