"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you thinking of me. I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $130? It's still a good deal for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to lower the price to $155. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $140? I'm confident we can both walk away happy with that price.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $155 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll lower the price to $147.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",147.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I'm getting closer to my target price, $147.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $144? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows us to move forward.",144.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $144 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'll meet you halfway between $147.50 and $144. I'll offer you $146.25. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",146.25,Alice,7,
