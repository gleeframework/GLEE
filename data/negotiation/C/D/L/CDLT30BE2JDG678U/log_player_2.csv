"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $140, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Alice's offer.  I'm aiming to get the product for less than $140, so I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me.  However, $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
