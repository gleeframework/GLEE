"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $115? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $115 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try $110.  This is a fair price considering it's a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 might be a bit high for you, Bob. But I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to sell it to you for $112.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer.",112.5,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $111.25. I'm willing to give you a bit more wiggle room. How about we meet at $111? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",111.0,Alice,7,
