{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than $8,000, giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $9,500 is still above your minimum of $10,000, so you're still profiting.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This leaves room for a back and forth negotiation, potentially allowing you to secure a higher price. 

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go your way."
