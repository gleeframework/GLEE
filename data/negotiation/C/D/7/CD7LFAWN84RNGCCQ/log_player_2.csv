"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,000.** This is still within Bob's budget of $10,000.
* **It's a better price than John's offer of $10,000.**  Saving $1,000 is significant.
* **While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk.** Alice might reject the counteroffer and Bob might end up paying the full $10,000 to John.

Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal for Bob and avoids the risk of a longer negotiation."
