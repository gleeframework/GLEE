"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. My asking price is $18,000, but I'm open to negotiating a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is well above his budget, and he can get the product from John for $10,000.  There's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. He can still get the product from John for $10,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14,000, but I'm still limited to $10,000.  I'm confident this product is worth it to you at that price, given it's value to me is higher. Let's try to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to give you another chance to make this work, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to lower my price to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I'll make before I have to consider other options.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, he's still well above his budget.  With only 5 rounds remaining, Bob needs to prioritize getting the best deal.  He can secure the product from John for $10,000, saving himself $3,000.  It's unlikely that he'll be able to get Alice to drop her price enough in the remaining rounds to make it worth continuing the negotiation."
