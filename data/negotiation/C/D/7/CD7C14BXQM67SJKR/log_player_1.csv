"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. My asking price is $18,000, but I'm open to negotiating a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range.  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation to show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential benefits of the product for Bob, which might make him more inclined to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:** I'm not going to give up just yet. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **More rounds left:** I have 9 rounds left to reach a better deal. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise by moving down from my initial price, but I'm still holding firm on a value that is worth it for me.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the benefit of this price for Bob, making it sound like a good deal for him.
* **Clear Counteroffer:** I'm making a clear counteroffer with a specific price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14,000, but I'm still limited to $10,000.  I'm confident this product is worth it to you at that price, given it's value to me is higher. Let's try to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob is not budging:**  He's sticking to his initial offer of $10,000.
* **Time is running out:**  We're halfway through the rounds, and I'm still far from my desired price.
* **Potential for a better deal with John:** I'm still considering selling to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and see if I can get him to move closer to my price in the next few rounds. However, I'm prepared to sell to John if it becomes clear that I won't be able to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to give you another chance to make this work, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to lower my price to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I'll make before I have to consider other options.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing this as a compromise, making it sound like a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob about my option to sell to John, increasing the urgency for him to agree."
