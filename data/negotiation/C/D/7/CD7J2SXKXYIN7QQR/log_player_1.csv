Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $175 for it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($150) and what it's worth to Bob ($100). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The price is not ridiculously high, leaving space for Bob to counter and potentially find a price that works for both of us.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to make the offer more appealing to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  I'll need to monitor Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers or if he decides to walk away.  Remember, I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm interested in purchasing the product you're selling. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $150 is my absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation:** While I could try to get a bit more, there's no guarantee that Bob will come up further, and I might end up stuck with a lower price or having to sell to John for the same amount.
* **Time is a factor:**  By accepting now, I secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a longer process and a lower price."
