"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate the negotiation. However, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130.  This is a fair price, considering I'm already paying more than John's offer. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,4,
