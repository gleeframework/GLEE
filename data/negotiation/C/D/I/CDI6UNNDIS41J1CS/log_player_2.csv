"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his limit as possible. $10,500 is a significant drop from Alice's offer and leaves some room for negotiation. This offer also demonstrates Bob's seriousness about acquiring the product while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is only $800 more than John's price.  Considering the risk of further negotiation, accepting this offer minimizes the potential financial loss. While there might be a slight chance of getting an even lower price, the chance of reaching a better deal with Alice is uncertain.  It's more prudent to accept the offer and finalize the purchase."
