Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $10,000 allows room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Highlighting value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price without revealing your hand about John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some time and flexibility. If you need to sell the product immediately, a lower offer might be more practical."
