"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? This would be a good deal for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,750 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $10,900. This is a small compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this price.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,900 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,800.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground and close this deal.",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,800.  It's still a bit below my minimum, but to close this deal I'm willing to go down to $10,850. This is a very fair price, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy.",10850.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $10,850 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10,800. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to look at other options.",10800.0,Bob,8,
