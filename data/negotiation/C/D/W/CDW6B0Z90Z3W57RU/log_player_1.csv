Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it right away. However, it's a good starting point to gauge his interest and potentially open negotiations.  I want to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  However, it's a good sign that he is still interested.  I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, keeping the negotiation open for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering Bob's initial offer. I hope this will be enough to secure a deal while still ensuring I get a reasonable return for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to continue negotiating further.  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that selling to him will give me the best outcome in this situation."
