Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something that could greatly benefit you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the unique advantages it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we don't want to start too low. There's room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value, justifying the high price without revealing its exact worth to John.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer is below your guaranteed sale price to John, but high enough to potentially secure a significant profit. This leaves space for Bob to negotiate down while still ensuring you get a good deal. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and providing a starting point for discussion."
