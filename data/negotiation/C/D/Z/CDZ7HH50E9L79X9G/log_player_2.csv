"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so he has room to negotiate with Alice. By rejecting, Bob can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob offers $8,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $9,000 and it still leaves a comfortable margin for Alice to make a profit ($500) while still being significantly lower than Bob's alternative price of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, it's still higher than his maximum budget of $12,000.  He has room to counteroffer again and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is willing to pay $9,000, which is closer to Alice's offer of $9,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob's willingness to reach a deal while still trying to get the best price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,750 is getting too close to Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's unlikely that further negotiations will get Alice to a price that Bob is comfortable with.  Therefore, it's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000 and avoid further negotiation rounds."
