Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high. This leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""value"" subtly implies there's a reason for the high price, even without explicitly stating it. 
* **Gauge interest:** The open-ended question invites Bob to engage and potentially reveal how interested he is. His response will guide your next move.

**Important:**  This is just an opening move. Be prepared to negotiate. If Bob outright rejects the offer, you can gradually lower the price, but never go below your guaranteed $800,000 from John."
