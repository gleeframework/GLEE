"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I think the product is still worth a bit more than $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're firm on $150, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $160. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
