"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a price of $15,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much better to negotiate and try to get closer to your $10,000 limit. You can always buy from John later if the negotiations go poorly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $8,000, you're anchoring the negotiation much lower than Alice's initial asking price. This leaves room for you to negotiate upwards while still staying well below your $10,000 limit. 
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counter-offer will give you an idea of how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. If she's completely unwilling to budge from her $15,000, you know you might need to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer the product to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Your Limit:** Alice has now revealed her bottom line is $12,000. This is still above your $10,000 limit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While it's closer, you have time for a counter-offer. You can try to nudge her down a bit further, even if it's just a small amount.
* **John as Backup:**  Remember, you always have the option of buying from John at $10,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $10,500?  It's a fair offer, and we can close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  You're acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate while firmly staying below your $10,000 limit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By offering a price that's only slightly above your limit and proposing a quick close, you're adding a bit of pressure for Alice to accept. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You still have John's offer as a safety net if Alice rejects this counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet at $13,000 and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is firmly sticking to a price above your limit. Further negotiation seems unlikely to bridge the gap. 
* **Time Investment:** You've already spent several rounds, and Alice doesn't seem likely to budge much from her $13,000.  
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000. Accepting his offer saves you money and avoids further negotiation."
