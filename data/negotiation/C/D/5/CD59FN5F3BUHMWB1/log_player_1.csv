""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to price the product high enough to maximize profit, but low enough that Bob finds it more appealing than walking away. 

Offering the product at $1,300,000 gives Bob a chance to make a significant gain if his valuation is even slightly higher than he initially thought. At the same time, it secures a profit of $300,000 for you, which is better than the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
