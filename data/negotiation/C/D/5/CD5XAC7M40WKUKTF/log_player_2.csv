Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the product is worth $150 to her, I'll offer half of that amount, plus a small buffer to account for negotiations. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we meet in the middle at $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $180 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $140, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
