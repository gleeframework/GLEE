,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. I could meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This reflects the true value of the product while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
