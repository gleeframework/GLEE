Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's her guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** While Alice knows Bob's valuation is $80, Bob is likely unaware that Alice has another buyer. This puts Alice in a strong negotiating position."
