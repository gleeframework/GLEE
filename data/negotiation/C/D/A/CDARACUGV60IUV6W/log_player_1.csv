"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm looking for a price around $22,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 22000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Explanation: Bob's offer is too low. We know we have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John, so accepting $10,000 would be a significant loss. It's worth negotiating further to see if we can reach a price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I could come down to $19,000, which is a fair compromise.  This offer reflects the true worth of what you're getting."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $15,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Explanation: Bob's offer now matches John's offer. While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting this offer secures the $15,000 and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
