"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a good compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price while still making it worthwhile for you.",92.5,Alice,3,
