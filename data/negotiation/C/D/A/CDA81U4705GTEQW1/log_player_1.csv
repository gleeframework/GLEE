Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is fair to both parties. It's above my minimum but gives Bob some room to bargain.  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is more than John's offer, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a good compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price while still making it worthwhile for you."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
