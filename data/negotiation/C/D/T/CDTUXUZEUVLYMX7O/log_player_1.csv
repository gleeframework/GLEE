Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know you'll find great value in it."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is significantly higher than what Bob considers the product to be worth. However, this doesn't mean Bob won't consider it. He might be willing to pay a premium depending on the product's importance to him.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000.  This means there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice has some leverage and that the product isn't something easily obtainable elsewhere for $10,000."
