I'm starting with a price of $17,500. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $15,000, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay at least $15,000 for the product, so I'm hoping to secure a higher price through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it still gives me a profit of $1,000. I hope this is appealing enough for Bob to accept, as I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm not willing to go that low.  I'm happy to sell to John for $15,000 and secure a fair price."
