"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000, which I think is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it, given its value to me. I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 was a bit steep, but I was hoping to get closer to the $12,000 mark, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Considering your offer of $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This would represent a fair compromise and allow us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is $1,000 above your last offer. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'm bringing to the table. Let's see if we can make a deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is closer to my budget and reflects the value I see in this product.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is $500 above your last offer. This is my last compromise before I have to consider other options.",9500.0,Alice,7,
