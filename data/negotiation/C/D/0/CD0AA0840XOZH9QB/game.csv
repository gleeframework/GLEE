"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $12000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $14000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $13000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not sure I can meet you at $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $14500. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really not willing to go above $13000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm hoping you can meet me at this price, but I'm also considering buying the product from John for $12000.",13000.0,Bob,6,
