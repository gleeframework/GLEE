Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth significantly more than that, even to you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price reflects both the value of the product and the need to stay within a reasonable range. I'm confident this offer is fair for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $980,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.
