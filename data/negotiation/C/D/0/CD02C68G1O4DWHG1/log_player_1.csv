"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while also maximizing my potential profit.  If Bob rejects this, it will give me a good gauge of his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, but still remaining above Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profit closer to my initial goal. If Bob rejects again, I'll have to consider the John offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer is now only $300 away from my minimum acceptable price.  I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing a sale completely. It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale than to continue negotiating and potentially end up with nothing."
