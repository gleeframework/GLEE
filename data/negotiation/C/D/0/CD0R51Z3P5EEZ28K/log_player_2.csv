"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* The product is worth $150 to you. 
* Alice's offer is $135, which is less than your value for the product. 
* Even though you could potentially save $15 by buying from John, you would still be paying more than the product is worth to you.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial decision."
