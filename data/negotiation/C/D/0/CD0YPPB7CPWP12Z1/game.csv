"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to pay closer to $10,000, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. Can we discuss further?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? This would allow both of us to get a good deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,750. I'm willing to come down to $11,200, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident you'll see the value in this product and be willing to meet me at this price.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,200 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10,750. Let's meet in the middle at $11,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to make a bit more to make this deal worthwhile. I'm thinking $11,250 is a fair compromise. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
