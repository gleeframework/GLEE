"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me halfway?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $135?,135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $135 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $142.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to go down to $138?,138.0,Bob,6,
