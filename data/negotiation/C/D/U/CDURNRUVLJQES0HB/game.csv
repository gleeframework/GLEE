"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,750,000 price point. I am willing to offer $1,600,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. While I'm eager to make this deal work, $1,600,000 is a bit lower than I can accept at this time. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This still leaves room for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
