"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $12000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13500.  This gives you a significant advantage over the market value.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I will reject the offer. I can get the product for $15,000 from John, which is a better deal than Alice's offer.
