"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $12000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13500.  This gives you a significant advantage over the market value.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",13500.0,Alice,1,
