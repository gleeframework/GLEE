Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $145. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $150 (what John will pay), there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower price. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob if he's interested but wants to negotiate a bit.
* **Time Value:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, selling to John quickly at $150 is still a good outcome."
