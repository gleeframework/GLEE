Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,000,000 is more than your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so there's room for him to counter and for you to potentially meet in the middle. 
* **It shows you're serious:** By offering a concrete price, you demonstrate that you're ready to negotiate seriously. 

Let's see how Bob responds and then adjust your strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its true worth for me. How about $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you initially proposed, and you know the product is worth more to him.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product holds for you. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we settle at $950,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You've moved from your initial $1,000,000, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  You're still above Bob's offer, allowing for potential future compromise.
* **Reiterates the value:** You remind Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to encourage him to come up in his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought and am willing to meet you halfway. Would $925,000 be acceptable for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is a good deal for you. It's significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000 and you've already established that he's willing to pay more.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, especially since you have a fallback option with John. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids further risk."
