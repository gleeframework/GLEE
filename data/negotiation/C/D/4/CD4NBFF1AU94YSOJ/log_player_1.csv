"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm confident I can get a better price with some negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $12,500 to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12500}

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $11,000 is closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'd prefer to get a bit more than $12,000 from Bob, it's getting late in the negotiation process, and I'm concerned that I might not get a better offer.  John is a sure thing, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale entirely."
