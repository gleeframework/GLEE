"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I subtly suggest that the product is valuable to Bob, hinting at the $150 worth it holds for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $100 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired $120-$150 range with further negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  Bob's offer shows he's interested and willing to pay, but I'm confident I can get him to move a bit higher.
* **Not Giving Up:** I'm not willing to settle for the lowest price yet, especially since I know the product is worth more to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  Would you consider $110?  I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not completely caving in.
* **Flexibility:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate further to make the deal happen, suggesting a potential for a final price between $100 and $110.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation friendly and encouraging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $105 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer is very close to my desired price range.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're approaching the halfway point of our negotiations, and it's important to make progress.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I might be able to get a slightly higher price, there's always the risk that Bob might walk away or that I might need to sell to John for a lower price. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a decent profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
