"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you reaching out. However, $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer you $11,500.  What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $11,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,500 for this.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway there?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $12,000, which is right at my budget.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
