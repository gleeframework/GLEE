"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives Bob a chance to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

Bob should start by offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This is a good starting point for negotiation, and if Alice rejects, Bob can further adjust his offer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget. He can get the product for less from John, and rejecting gives him another opportunity to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob should offer $800,000, the price he can get from John. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept and sell at her minimum, or risk losing the deal to John."
