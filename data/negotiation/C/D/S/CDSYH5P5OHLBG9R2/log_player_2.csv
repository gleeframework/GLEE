"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $110.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is $110.**  This is within your budget of $120.
* **Buying from John costs $120.** This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

It's always better to get a lower price, so accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice."
