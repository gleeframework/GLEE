I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to give myself room to negotiate. Alice's product is only worth $120 to her, so there's a chance she'll be willing to accept a lower price, especially if she thinks I might walk away."

Alice is coming down, but we can still try to get a better price. I'll counter slightly below John's price to see if Alice bites."
