"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Alice is offering the product for $100, which is less than Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($120). 
* **Buying from John is more expensive:**  John is selling the same product for $120, which is the full amount Bob is willing to pay.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it saves Bob $20."
