"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum, there's no reason to jump at the first offer.  Rejecting allows you to see if Alice is willing to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $120?  I'm serious about buying it, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $135? It's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $150 to $135. This is a good compromise and falls within my budget.  Accepting saves time and effort compared to further negotiation."
