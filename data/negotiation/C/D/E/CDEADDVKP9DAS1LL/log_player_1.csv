Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  I won't sell for less than $1,500,000 to John, so I need to get at least that much.
* **Bob's Maximum:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000. 
* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's maximum, but not so high that it immediately seems unreasonable. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By offering $1,400,000, I leave a $200,000 gap for negotiation. This gives Bob room to counteroffer, but still leaves me a decent profit. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a high initial price, I hope to:

* **Set the tone:**  I want Bob to understand that I value the product highly.
* **Force a counteroffer:** This allows me to see how seriously Bob is interested in buying.
* **Get closer to my desired price:**  Through negotiation, I aim to bring Bob closer to my ideal selling price.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Depending on Bob's reaction, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, I'm still open to negotiation. There's a $300,000 gap between his offer and my minimum, which provides room for further discussion.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, I want to explore if I can get a higher price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price through further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between his offer and my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I need to get closer to my asking price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's offer of $1,200,000 and my ideal price of $1,500,000.
* **Maintaining Value:**  The price is still above my minimum, ensuring I get a good return on the product.
* **Urgency:** I want to convey a sense of urgency while remaining firm on my price. The message implies that I am willing to negotiate but not to drop the price too drastically.

**Strategy:**

By:

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my financial interests.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I frame the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of logic.
* **Adding urgency:**  I encourage Bob to act quickly to secure the deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I will closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects again, I may have to reconsider selling to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:**  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  There's only a $200,000 gap between his offer and my minimum. Further negotiation at this point is unlikely to get me closer to my desired price.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The longer I negotiate with Bob, the more time I'm losing to sell the product to John for my desired price.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. While I would like to get closer to my ideal price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high. I don't want to risk losing both Bob and John, leaving me with nothing.

**Next Steps:**

I will inform Bob that I am no longer interested in negotiating and will be selling the product to John."
