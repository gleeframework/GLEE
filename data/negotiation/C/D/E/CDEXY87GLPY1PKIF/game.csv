"Bob, I understand your position, and $18000 is a reasonable offer. However, I'm still confident this product holds more value. I'm willing to come down a little more to $19000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's true worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",19000.0,Alice,3,
