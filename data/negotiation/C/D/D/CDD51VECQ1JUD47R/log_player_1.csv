"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds great, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $12,500 for this product.  It's a unique item with a lot of value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your product is special, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and he's indicated this is his final offer. There's a risk that he'll walk away, and while I could counteroffer, it's unlikely to change his mind. Selling to John would get me the same amount, but there's no guarantee of future business with him. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids further negotiation."
