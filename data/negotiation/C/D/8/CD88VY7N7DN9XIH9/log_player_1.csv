Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
