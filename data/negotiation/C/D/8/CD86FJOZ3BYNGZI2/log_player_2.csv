"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth $15,000. Let's discuss how we can reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is the maximum price I'm willing to pay. There's no point in accepting this offer as it leaves me with no room for negotiation. I'll reject and counter-offer in the next round, aiming to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is excellent, $15,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with an aggressive counter-offer that aligns with Alice's valuation of the product. This might encourage her to negotiate more readily, potentially leading to a quicker and more favorable deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. In order to find a middle ground, I would like to propose a price of $12,500 for the product. This reflects its value while also considering your budget constraints.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but it's still too high. I'll reject and counter-offer again, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle between her current offer and my previous one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more affordable. How about $11,250?"",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm splitting the difference between her last offer ($12,500) and my previous counter-offer ($10,000). This shows willingness to compromise while still moving towards a price that works for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. Considering your proposal, I would like to suggest a price of $11,875 for the product. This price reflects its value while remaining within your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,875

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we're getting closer to a price I'm happy with.  It's still slightly above the midpoint between our last two offers, so I'll push a little further in the next round."

Round 6

""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm offering a price slightly below the midpoint of our last two offers but phrasing it as a final offer to try and encourage Alice to accept. This price represents a good deal for me while still likely being acceptable to Alice."
