"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better deal than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,200 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still a bit higher than he wants to pay.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,400 is getting closer to Bob's limit of $12,000.  While he could continue to negotiate, there's a chance that Alice won't budge further and the negotiations could go on indefinitely.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product for $12,000, which is still within his budget and a safer option than risking further negotiation."
