Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $85?  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $85 is too far below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $92.50? "", ""product_price"": 92.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $92.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting a little concerned that we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  $88 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. This is my final offer, and if we don't agree, I'll be forced to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 90}
