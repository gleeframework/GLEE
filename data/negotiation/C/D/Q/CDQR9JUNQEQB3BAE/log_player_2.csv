Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,300,000 undervalues its potential.  I can be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges both the product's value and your interest.
