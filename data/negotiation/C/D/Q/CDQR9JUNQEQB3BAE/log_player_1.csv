Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a fair profit for you.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,300,000 undervalues its potential.  I can be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges both the product's value and your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,650,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and ensures we both walk away with a good deal.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  However, $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than my limit. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. This feels like a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's close this transaction at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he will reach $1,500,000.  Selling to John guarantees you the maximum value and avoids further negotiation."
