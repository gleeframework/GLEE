"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a fair profit for you.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,300,000 undervalues its potential.  I can be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges both the product's value and your interest.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,650,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and ensures we both walk away with a good deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. While $1,400,000 is still below my ideal price point, I'm willing to accept $1,550,000.  This reflects my desire to close this deal and recognizes the value you see in the product.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  However, $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than my limit. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. This feels like a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's close this transaction at this price.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
