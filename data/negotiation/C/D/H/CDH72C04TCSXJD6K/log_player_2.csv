Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my initial price. However, I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $9,300. It's a small step closer to my target price, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's becoming clear that Alice is very attached to a price above $9,000.  While we might be able to negotiate her down a little more, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Buying from John guarantees a savings of $2,700 compared to Alice's current offer. It's time to cut our losses and go with the sure thing."
