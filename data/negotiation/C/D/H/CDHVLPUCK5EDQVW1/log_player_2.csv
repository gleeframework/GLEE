"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would significantly benefit your business. After careful consideration, I am offering it to you for $1,350,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than the price he can get from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while still being within my budget.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I must maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. Therefore, I am counteroffering at $1,300,000 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, $1,300,000 is still more than what Bob can get from John.  It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm confident that we can close this deal if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest, Bob, and I understand the value you place on the product. After reviewing our costs and the market conditions, I am prepared to counteroffer at $1,295,000 for the product. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. I look forward to your response and hope we can finalize this transaction.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but $1,295,000 is still above Bob's target price.  He's already gone back and forth with Alice a few times and doesn't want to risk her further increasing the price again. Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product for the lowest possible price within his budget."
