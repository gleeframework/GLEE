"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. How about $875,000? This compromise allows us both to gain something from the deal.  Let's keep the conversation going and find a mutually agreeable price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for us both.  Would you consider $887,500?  This is a significant concession on my end and demonstrates my willingness to make this deal happen.",887500.0,Alice,5,
