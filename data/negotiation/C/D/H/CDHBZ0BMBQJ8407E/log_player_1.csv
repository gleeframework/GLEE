"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and valuation of the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. I have 10 rounds and can always fall back on selling to John for $1,500,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product and my budget constraints, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,125,000. This price seems to strike a balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe there's room for improvement.  I'm not in a rush and can leverage the remaining rounds to potentially squeeze out a better deal. The option to sell to John for $1,500,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still not quite there for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,140,000.  This is a very fair offer, considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1140000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued cooperation, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,135,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise given the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,135,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,135,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer of $1,135,000 is a good compromise. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk that further counter-offers could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away entirely.  At this point, securing a sale and getting a price within a reasonable range of my minimum is the best course of action."
