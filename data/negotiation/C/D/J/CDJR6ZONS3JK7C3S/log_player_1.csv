Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows for a significant profit margin.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is a significant amount but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Appealing to Bob's self-interest:**  I'm highlighting the profit margin Bob can make, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm ending with an open question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to secure a high price while also keeping the negotiation open for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting would be a financial loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he's shown interest in the product.  I can likely negotiate a higher price in subsequent rounds.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:**  However, John's offer of $800,000 provides a guaranteed profit and is a reliable backup plan.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range while still remaining aware of John's alternative offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's meet halfway on this."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering $850,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $700,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the potential profit he can make.
* **Encouraging agreement:**  I'm using language like ""meet halfway"" to make the counteroffer sound more appealing and encourage Bob to accept. 

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while still maximizing my profit. I'm leaving room for further negotiation if necessary, but I'm also positioning myself to close the deal if Bob is reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation stalled:**  Bob has been consistently offering below my minimum, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or even a lower offer from him.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids any further risk or potential delays with Bob.

While I'd ideally like to get a higher price, the potential for a better deal with Bob seems unlikely at this point.  It's more prudent to accept John's offer, which ensures a secure and satisfactory outcome."
