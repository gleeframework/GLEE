{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for a high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high, but is still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get a higher price.  I will counter with a slightly lower price, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I need to make a bit more than $120 to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, Alice. However, I'm still hoping to keep my spending within $120. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between $120 and $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer to get $130, it's not worth risking losing the sale completely.  I'll accept his offer to secure the sale."
