Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Strong Opening:**  Starting with $1,100,000 anchors the negotiation high and leaves room for potential concessions while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly highlights the value proposition to justify the high price. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a fallback buyer (John) at $800,000, ensuring you won't be forced to go below your minimum.

This strategy attempts to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having a safety net in place with John's offer."
