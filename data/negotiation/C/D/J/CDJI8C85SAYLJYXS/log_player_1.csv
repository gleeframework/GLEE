Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is his maximum price, and it matches what John is willing to pay. There's no point in further negotiation as it's unlikely to result in a better outcome than $15,000.  It's best to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
