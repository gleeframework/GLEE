"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,000 for the product. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $9,500? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $11,250 for the product. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",11250.0,Alice,5,
