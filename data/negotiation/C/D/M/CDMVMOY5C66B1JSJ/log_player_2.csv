"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $10,000 to you. I understand its significant worth to you and would like to extend an exclusive offer. For a limited time, I am willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a special opportunity to acquire the product at a price that's just $500 below its perceived value to you. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and preferences. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is employing some negotiation tactics by:

* **Inflating the product's worth to you:**  She claims it's valued at $10,000 to you, even though you haven't stated that.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  She uses phrases like ""limited time"" and ""special opportunity.""

While her offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $10,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further if you reject this initial offer."
