"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiating, $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and would make this a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
