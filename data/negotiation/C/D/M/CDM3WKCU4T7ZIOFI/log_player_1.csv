"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see if he's willing to budge. I'm also leaving some room to potentially come down in price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,500. This is a compromise, as I'm coming down from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for him, while still staying within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my desired price and a good compromise. It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and worth the risk of not getting a better offer in the remaining rounds."
