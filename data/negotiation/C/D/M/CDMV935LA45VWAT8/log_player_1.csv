Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
