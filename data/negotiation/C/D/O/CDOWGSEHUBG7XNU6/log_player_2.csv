"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to part with it for the right price. I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a substantial discount from its true worth, but it reflects my desire to see it go to someone who will truly appreciate its value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
