"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1500000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to be reasonable. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not able to go as high as $1500000.  However, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1250000. This is the absolute maximum I can offer.  Let's see if we can close a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you've reached your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
