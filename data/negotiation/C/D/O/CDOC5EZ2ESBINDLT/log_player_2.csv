{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring options before committing.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. You have a significant buffer (your $15,000 limit) to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price shows a strong desire to negotiate. $7,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for compromise while still being significantly below your $15,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to try and push for a lower price closer to your $7,000 counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to compromise by lowering her price.  By increasing your counteroffer to $8,000, you're showing a willingness to meet halfway while still staying within your desired price range. This should encourage further negotiation and a potential deal closer to your goal."
