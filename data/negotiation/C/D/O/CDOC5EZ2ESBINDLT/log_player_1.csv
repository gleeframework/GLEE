"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum value of $8,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,000. This is still a decent profit for me, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum value of $8,000. I'm happy to accept this, as it ensures I don't lose money on the sale. While I would have preferred a higher price, it's important to secure a deal and avoid risking a lower offer in the next round."
