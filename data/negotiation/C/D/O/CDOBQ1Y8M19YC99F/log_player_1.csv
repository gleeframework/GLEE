Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Strategic pricing:** $1,450,000 is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This tests Bob's willingness to pay a premium and gives you negotiating leverage.
* **Open communication:** The message invites Bob to share his thoughts, fostering a dialogue that can lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market research:** While not provided in the prompt, understanding typical price ranges for similar products is crucial.
* **Bob's negotiation style:** Observing Bob's responses will help you adjust your approach in subsequent turns.  
* **Time sensitivity:** If there's urgency to the sale, this might influence your pricing strategy."
