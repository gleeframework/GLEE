Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm valuing it at $18,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more than selling to John.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you are subtly anchoring Bob's perception of the price. 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you will list it publicly (or implying you have other buyers), you create a sense of scarcity and urgency for Bob to make a decision.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There are other approaches depending on your negotiation style and your assumptions about Bob. You could:

* **Start with a slightly lower price:** (e.g., $15,000) to increase the chances of Bob accepting immediately.
* **Provide more details about the product's value:**  This could justify the higher price in Bob's mind."
