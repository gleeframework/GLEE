Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $1,500,000 reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Gauging Bob's interest:** The message is framed to gauge Bob's enthusiasm. If he's immediately put off by the high price, you know he might be a tough negotiator. If he expresses interest, you have room to negotiate down slightly.
* **Justification:**  The message implies the product's value justifies the high price, potentially making Bob more amenable to paying a premium.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. How you proceed depends on Bob's response.  Be prepared to negotiate, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum!"
