"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to significantly enhance efficiency and productivity in your operations. Given its high-quality features and benefits, we believe it's worth more than its face value. Considering its market value and the potential return on investment for you, I am offering it to you for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000, and Alice's initial offer is also $15,000, there's no room for negotiation to save money. It's better to buy from John immediately, as you know his price is fixed and you won't have to risk further negotiations."
