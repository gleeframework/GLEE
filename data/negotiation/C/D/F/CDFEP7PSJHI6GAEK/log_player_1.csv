Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's a good chance he'll accept. However, if he rejects, I can always counter-offer or fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,500 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter-offer Bob and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $14,000 is still a good price for both of us. This leaves some room for further negotiation, but it's still closer to my ideal price than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $13,200 is still a good profit for me and better than selling to John. It's worth closing the deal at this point, as further negotiations may not yield a significantly higher price."
