"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always good to try and negotiate.  Since Bob's maximum value is $10,000, and Alice's offer is at that price, there's room to potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer that's 20% lower than Alice's initial price is a good starting point. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating, but also leaves room for some back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $9,000 is a good price, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and there's still room to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is trying to split the difference between his previous offer of $8,000 and Alice's latest offer of $9,000. This shows continued commitment to negotiation while also indicating that he is willing to increase his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and this offer is now within a reasonable range for Bob.  Accepting this offer will save Bob $1,250 compared to buying from John.  While there's always the possibility of pushing for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for a small additional saving."
