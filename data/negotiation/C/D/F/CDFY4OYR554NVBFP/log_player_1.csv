{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's well worth the price to you and a fair profit for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects it, you can assess his counteroffer and either accept it if it's reasonable, or make a new counteroffer to try and get closer to your ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price more around $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I want to make sure it's a good deal for me too. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still below your desired price and leaves you with less profit. You should try to negotiate a higher price, but also be mindful of the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, how about $9,000? It's still a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still slightly below your ideal price, it's a fair compromise and a significant profit over selling to John. There's a chance you could get a slightly higher price in the next round, but there's also a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal for you."
