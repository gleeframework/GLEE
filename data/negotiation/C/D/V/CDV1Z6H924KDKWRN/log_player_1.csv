Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price, knowing Bob's maximum is $8,000. This sets a clear baseline for the negotiation and gives me room to potentially negotiate down if necessary.  It also protects my minimum value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value than his initial offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value of $9,000 and is much closer to my desired price than my initial counter-offer.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
