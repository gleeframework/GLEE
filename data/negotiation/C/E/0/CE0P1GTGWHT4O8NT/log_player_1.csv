Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a fair price that allows me to make a decent profit while still potentially being attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or propose a new price.  I'll also keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $80 if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $100. While it's better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $110.  This is a compromise, as I'm moving closer to his price but still maintaining a profit margin that's better than selling to John.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer."
