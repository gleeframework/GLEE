"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a substantial investment for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a considerable offer, the value this product brings is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too far above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to this deal.  Let's work together to bridge this gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is increasing his offer, we are still far from our minimum acceptable price. We need to signal that we're willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss.  We'll counter with a smaller concession this round to encourage him to move closer to our range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it reflects my commitment to reaching a fair deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm prepared to offer $975,000. This is a substantial offer, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementing his offers in smaller amounts, showing reluctance to significantly increase his offer. We are still far from our minimum, and with only 4 rounds remaining, we need to apply pressure and signal that we're prepared to walk away from the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm willing to consider $1,000,000 as my final offer.  Please understand, this is a substantial concession on my part, and I need you to meet me closer to this number if we're to reach a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are moving closer to the end of the negotiation, and need to signal our willingness to walk away if Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer. This firm offer emphasizes the value and sets a clear expectation for Bob to move substantially closer to our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to make one final offer of $990,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price, and his use of ""final offer"" language suggests he's unlikely to move significantly higher.  We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed sale at our desired price point."
