"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's wise to reject and make a counteroffer in the next round.  You have a lot of room to negotiate down from your $800,000 limit."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a substantial investment for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a considerable offer, the value this product brings is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for my budget. While she's come down from her initial price, it's still more than $300,000 above my comfortable range. I'll counter again and try to get closer to my goal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still above my target.  I have 5 rounds left and I want to see if I can get her down even further. I'll counter with a price closer to my limit, hoping to close the gap in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm willing to consider $1,000,000 as my final offer.
