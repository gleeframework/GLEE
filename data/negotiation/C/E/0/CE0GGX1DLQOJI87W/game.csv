"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a substantial investment for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a considerable offer, the value this product brings is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too far above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to this deal.  Let's work together to bridge this gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm willing to consider $1,000,000 as my final offer.  Please understand, this is a substantial concession on my part, and I need you to meet me closer to this number if we're to reach a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
