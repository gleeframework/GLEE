{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm willing to make a deal at $900,000."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $900,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $100,000 discount from his perceived value, and you earn a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Exclusivity Factor:**  By presenting this as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you add a level of urgency and desirability, potentially influencing Bob's decision."
