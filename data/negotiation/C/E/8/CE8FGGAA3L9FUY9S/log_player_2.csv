"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still within your budget and a much better deal than buying from John for $800,000.  While you might be able to negotiate a lower price, there's a risk she'll reject any further counteroffers. Accepting her offer secures the product at a good price."
