"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, you can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice. You are willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend a little less. Would you be willing to go down to $9,000? It's still a good deal for you, and a good starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,250 is still a good deal for Bob, as he's willing to pay up to $10,000. It's a compromise that saves him $750 compared to buying from John. While there's a possibility he could negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ending up paying $10,000 to John outweighs the potential savings."
