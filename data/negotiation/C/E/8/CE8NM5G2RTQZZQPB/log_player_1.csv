Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a good price, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $7,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is still a fair price for both of us. It's a compromise that's closer to my minimum, and hopefully, Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $7,800 is closer to my minimum, I don't want to risk further negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better price with John, so I'm going to sell the product to him for $8,000."
