"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $850,000, which is still significantly lower than Alice's offer, but within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential negotiation. This is a reasonable starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a lower price.  There's still room for Alice to move closer to Bob's desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is raising his offer slightly to $900,000. This demonstrates that he is willing to compromise but is still pushing for a better price. This counteroffer is a midpoint between Bob's ideal price of $800,000 and Alice's last offer of $950,000, potentially enticing Alice to accept."
