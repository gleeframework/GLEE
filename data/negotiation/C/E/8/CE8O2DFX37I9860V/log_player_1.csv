Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant amount above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, giving him room to negotiate.  However, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring I still make a profit.  

Let's see if Bob is willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, or, in the worst-case scenario, sell to John for my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $950,000, which is still above Bob's offer of $850,000 but closer to his perceived value. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 to be worth accepting. This deal ensures I still make a substantial profit, and further negotiation with Bob might risk losing him as a buyer entirely."
