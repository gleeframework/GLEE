"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but based on my research and budget, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a price point that works for both of us, $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I could be persuaded to part with it for $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
