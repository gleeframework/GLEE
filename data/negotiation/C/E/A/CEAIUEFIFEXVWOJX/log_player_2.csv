# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I need to make a profit, and $1,200,000 was my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a new offer of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm open to further discussion.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.

Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence in negotiations.  $1,080,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,065,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to come out with a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize the agreement."", ""product_price"": 1065000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'll meet you at $1,065,000, but I need to make a small adjustment to cover some additional costs. Let me see... I'll offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your ideal price. While you could continue negotiating, you only have three rounds left.  At this point, it's better to accept John's offer of $1,000,000 to secure the product and avoid the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice. You've already saved a significant amount compared to her initial asking price."
