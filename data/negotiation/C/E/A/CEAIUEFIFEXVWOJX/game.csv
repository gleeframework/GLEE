"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I need to make a profit, and $1,200,000 was my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a new offer of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm open to further discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is a good compromise and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $1,050,000 yet. I'll make a new offer of $1,080,000. This is a bit closer to my minimum, but I'm still willing to negotiate further if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence in negotiations.  $1,080,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,065,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to come out with a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize the agreement.",1065000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'll meet you at $1,065,000, but I need to make a small adjustment to cover some additional costs. Let me see... I'll offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can make this work.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
