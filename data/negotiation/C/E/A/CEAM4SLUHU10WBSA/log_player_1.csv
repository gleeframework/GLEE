Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you, and it's worth a lot more than my asking price. I'm looking for a quick sale, so how about $19,000?"", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $19,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob offered the absolute minimum I'd accept.  There's no room for negotiation left.
