"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my [Product Name] at a price that reflects its true value. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's discuss a price that falls within a fair range, ensuring we both walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum value. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting Alice's offer allows him to negotiate a better price or explore other options."
