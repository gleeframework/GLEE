Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I understand this product may have a different value to you, but I'm confident it's worth more than that.  To show my willingness to continue negotiating, I'm willing to drop my price to $1750000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for you.  Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1250000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1500000. This is a price that reflects its true value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. It's my final offer, let me know what you think.
