"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my best offer.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I understand this product may have a different value to you, but I'm confident it's worth more than that.  To show my willingness to continue negotiating, I'm willing to drop my price to $1750000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for you.  Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm looking for in this product.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1250000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1500000. This is a price that reflects its true value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. It's my final offer, let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
