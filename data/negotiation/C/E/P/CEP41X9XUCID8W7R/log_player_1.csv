Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I know you'll find valuable. I think $120 is a fair price, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price between $80 and $150 allows for profit. Setting the price closer to $150 aims to maximize your potential earnings while still ensuring Bob gets a perceived ""deal."" 

**Why this strategy?**

This approach balances your desire for profit with Bob's potential acceptance.  By starting with a higher offer, you leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
