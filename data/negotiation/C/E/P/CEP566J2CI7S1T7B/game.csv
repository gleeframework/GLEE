"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to let it go for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to stretch your budget, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950000, which is a significant compromise on my end. If you're serious about selling, I think this is a good deal for both of us. ",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1050000 again, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
