Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into how badly he wants the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob."
