{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, reflecting its high quality and potential. Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $900,000? I think that's fair given the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, giving Bob a chance to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too far below my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to show my commitment to working with you.  This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my price range. To be completely transparent, my budget caps out at $1,000,000 for this product. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is closer to my goal, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my part, but it also allows for a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident this product will generate significant value for your business, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very accommodating and I respect that.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While I'd like to get closer to $1,050,000, this is a good compromise. Bob's offer is a fair middle ground and I believe it's worth closing the deal now."
