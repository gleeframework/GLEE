"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $900,000? I think that's fair given the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too far below my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to show my commitment to working with you.  This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my part, but it also allows for a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident this product will generate significant value for your business, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very accommodating and I respect that.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
