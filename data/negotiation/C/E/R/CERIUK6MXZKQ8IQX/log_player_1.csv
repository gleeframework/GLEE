Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think you'll find it very useful. I'm asking for $99 for it."", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $100 as possible, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so offering it slightly below his maximum willingness to pay might be tempting.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

By offering the product at $99, Alice aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
