"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm hoping we can reach a slightly lower price point. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a lower price point, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we try $900,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $900,000 is closer, I think a more reasonable price would be $750,000. This reflects a significant saving for me while still acknowledging the value of the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you and the original price I was looking for, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $850,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
