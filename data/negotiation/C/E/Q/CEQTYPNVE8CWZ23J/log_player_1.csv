Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing I can always go down. I'm also being friendly and engaging, hoping to build a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $150. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my target price of $150 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a little to $175, but I can't go lower than that. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob.  I've reduced the price, but not by too much, showing I'm serious about getting a fair price for the product. I'm also reaffirming my value to Bob, hoping to keep him interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $160. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm realizing that I have limited rounds and Bob may not be willing to budge further. Accepting $160 is a better outcome than selling to John for $150."
