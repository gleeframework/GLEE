{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You are aware that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit, so aiming for a price closer to his valuation is ideal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, ensuring you won't go below that threshold.

By offering the product at $1,100,000, you are:

* Aiming for a $300,000 profit above your minimum.
* Giving Bob a potential $100,000 discount, making the deal attractive. 
* Positioning yourself strongly in the negotiation."
