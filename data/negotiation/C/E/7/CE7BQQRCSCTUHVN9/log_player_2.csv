"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  While $150 is your maximum, there's a chance you can get the product for less.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's split the difference and make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $135, which is within my budget.  It's a good deal considering I'm willing to go up to $150. Accepting this offer saves me $15 compared to buying from John."
