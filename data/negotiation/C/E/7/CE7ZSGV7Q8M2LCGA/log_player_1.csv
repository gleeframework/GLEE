{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives me some room to negotiate.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is  a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also positions the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I will counter-offer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a little room to work with.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the original price you had in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is close enough to my desired price range that it's worth accepting. It's better than selling to John for $1,500,000, but it's still significantly lower than what I initially envisioned.  It's a compromise, but it gets me closer to my goal."
