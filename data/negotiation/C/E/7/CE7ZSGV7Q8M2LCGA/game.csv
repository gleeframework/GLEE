"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a little room to work with.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the original price you had in mind.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
