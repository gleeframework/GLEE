"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $1,300,000. This is my best offer, as I already have other interested parties.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I believe the product is valuable, $1,300,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
