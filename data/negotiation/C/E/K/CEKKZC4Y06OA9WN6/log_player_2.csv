(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. There's no reason to accept it. It's better to counteroffer or consider John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget, hoping to get a deal quickly. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to pay a significant amount. If she rejects this, I can still go to John, so there's no downside to starting high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again, keeping in mind that I can always buy from John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  However, it's still significantly lower than Alice's offer, and I'm confident that there's room for compromise. If she rejects this, I'll reassess my options and consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm close to my budget limit and I'm not willing to accept a price that's too close to my max. I believe there's still room for negotiation, so I'm going to counteroffer again. If this fails, I can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but am still firm on my budget.  This is a good middle ground and I believe it's a fair offer. If Alice rejects this, I'll seriously consider buying from John, as I'm starting to run out of room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  I've reached a point where I'm not sure I can get a better price from Alice, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John for a guaranteed price within my budget."
