"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price. There's a chance she might be willing to accept a lower offer, especially if she wants to sell the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also emphasizes that her initial price is unacceptable.  This allows room for negotiation while still giving me a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get the price down even further. There's a good chance she might be willing to compromise, especially since she has already rejected my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to offer Alice my maximum budget, which is $1,500,000. This is the price point I'm willing to pay for the product, and it leaves no room for further negotiation. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll buy the product from John."
