Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to get a good deal while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal by counter-offering. I'm confident that Bob is interested in the product and will likely engage in further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer. It shows I am willing to negotiate while still ensuring a profit above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at $11,000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to accept his offer and secure the sale. Further negotiation might not result in a significantly higher price, and I risk losing the deal altogether."
