Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still making a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to haggle, potentially allowing me to still get more than $120. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John, so there's no risk in aiming slightly higher with Bob. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit from Bob with the security of a guaranteed sale to John."
