"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $110. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a better price than John's $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105, which is still a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $108. This is my best offer based on the value we place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $108 is a good compromise.  It's lower than her initial offer and still within Bob's budget, making it a worthwhile purchase.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject again, or Bob might end up buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal."
