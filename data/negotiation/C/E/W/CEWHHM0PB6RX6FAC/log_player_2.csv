"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You can do better than $1,100,000.  You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so you should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects the immense value and potential this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

You're still better off trying to negotiate a lower price. $1,050,000 is still too high, considering your maximum budget and Alice's potential profit margin.  You should counteroffer again."
