Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome. 
* **Justification:**  While Bob values the product at $10,000, Alice knows it's worth that to her as a minimum. By framing the offer around ""value"" and ""potential,"" she subtly justifies a higher price. 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning she'll list it publicly (implying other buyers), she creates a sense of urgency and scarcity.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale with John at her minimum price."
