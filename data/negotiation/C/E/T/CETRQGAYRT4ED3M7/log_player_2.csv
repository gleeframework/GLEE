It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000 and Alice is offering it for $12,000, you have room to negotiate."

You still have some room to negotiate.  Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but you can likely get it for even less."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11250, Bob. I think the product's value is worth a bit more than that. I'm willing to go to $11500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and you are now very close to your target of $10,500.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your offer and you'll end up buying from John for $15,000.  It's better to take the deal at this point."
