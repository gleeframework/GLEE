I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point, and I'll be able to adjust based on Bob's response.  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to me, and I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I believe the product holds more value and I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I believe this is a fair price, given that Bob is willing to pay at least $1,200,000. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise and a better deal than selling to John for $1,200,000.  It's not as much as I initially hoped for, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
