Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. It's a great deal, considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will get from the product. 
* This strategy aims to get Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially find a price that works for both of us. 
*  If he rejects, I can then use the threat of selling to John at $15,000 as leverage in future negotiations."
