"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm open to counteroffers, showing flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  My offer is well above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant portion of the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it's a starting point for further negotiation. I believe I can still get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum, so selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option.

I will now make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $1,700,000 to $1,600,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reinforcing the reason for the price point.
* **Fairness:**  I frame the offer as a ""fair"" price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** My offer remains above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant amount.

This counteroffer gives Bob a reasonable price point to consider while still ensuring I get a fair return on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  There's a significant gap between our desired prices.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to lead to a price I'm comfortable with, especially considering his consistent low offers.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on a valuable asset.

It's more prudent to sell to John now and secure my minimum profit rather than risk further negotiation with Bob that might result in a lower price."
