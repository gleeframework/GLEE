# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value at this price. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll counter with an offer of $887,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $887,500 is very close to your maximum budget of $800,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk is that Alice might reject your next offer and you'll be forced to buy from John at $800,000.  

Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product while still saving a significant amount compared to Alice's initial asking price."
