"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $135, which would be $142.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",142.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,130.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Bob,4,,
