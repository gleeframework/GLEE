Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than your minimum price:**  You're aiming to earn more than $8,000, so starting at $11,000 is a good place to begin.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  By not going straight for the maximum, you allow for some back-and-forth. Bob might counter with a lower offer, and you can then adjust your price.
* **Is enticing to Bob:** The price is below what the product is worth to him, making it a potentially good deal for him. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
