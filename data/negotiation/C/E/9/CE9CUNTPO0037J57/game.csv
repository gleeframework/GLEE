"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $160? It's a fair price considering the value this product offers.",160.0,Alice,3,
