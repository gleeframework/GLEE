{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is higher than your minimum but leaves room for potential bargaining.  It also emphasizes the value of the product to you, which may make Bob more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $20000 is far outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're open to negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to accept that, but I'm also not ready to sell to John yet.  I'll see if I can get a better counteroffer from Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is still a significant discount from what it's worth to me, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll try to push for a higher offer from Bob."
