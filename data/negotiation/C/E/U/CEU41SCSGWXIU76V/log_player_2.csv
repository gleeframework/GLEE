# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is still a significant discount from what it's worth to me, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's getting closer to my budget. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 just doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go down to $11000. This would be a great deal for you and would still allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $11,000 is tempting, it's still slightly outside of my comfort zone. I'm going to take the safe route and buy the product from John for $8,000.  This ensures I stay within my budget and avoid further negotiation."
