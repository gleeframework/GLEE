"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
