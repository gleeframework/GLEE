,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit above that. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which I think is a fair compromise. This gives you a good deal while ensuring I can make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle on this.",95.0,Alice,5,
