Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice is splitting the difference, and at $12,250 the deal is within my acceptable price range. There's no guarantee I could get the price lower, and it's better than paying John's price of $12,000."
