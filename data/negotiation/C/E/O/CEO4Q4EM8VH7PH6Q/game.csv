"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $110? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110. How about $107.50? Would you be willing to accept that?,107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $109.  Let's try to close this deal! ",109.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the best I can do.",108.0,Bob,6,
