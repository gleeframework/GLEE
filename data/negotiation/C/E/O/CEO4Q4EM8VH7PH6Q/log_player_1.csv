Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is closer to my minimum, I still feel I can get a better price. I'm not ready to give up on this negotiation yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $110? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110. How about $107.50? Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $107.50 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to counter with a lower price than my last offer to show flexibility but still aim for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $109.  Let's try to close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to secure a sale than risk losing both Bob and John."
