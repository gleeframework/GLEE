{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate. It also frames the offer as a benefit for Bob, which might increase his likelihood of accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. It's still a good deal for me, but I'd like to save a bit more money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell and can potentially get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,700. This is still a fantastic price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $8,350. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and while I would prefer a higher price, accepting his offer is a better choice than selling to John for $8,000.  It's time to finalize the deal."
