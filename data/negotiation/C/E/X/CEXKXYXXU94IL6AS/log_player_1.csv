"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup option with John, so I don't need to rush into a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer than his previous offer. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have John as a backup option, so I'm not pressured to accept a very low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price, and I'm feeling confident that I can get a better price in future rounds. However, I also have John as a backup buyer, and there's a chance I could spend more rounds going back and forth with Bob and end up with a lower price than what John is offering. So, I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale."
