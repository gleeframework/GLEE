Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which reflects a compromise on both our ends.  I believe this price still provides you with a good value, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. What do you think?
