"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and it's a fair price for me considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given that the product is only worth $1,200,000 to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this strikes a balance between the value you place on the product and my valuation.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which reflects a compromise on both our ends.  I believe this price still provides you with a good value, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I'll consider the compromise you've presented. To continue moving forward, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000. This aims to be closer to your needs while also staying within my budget constraints.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
