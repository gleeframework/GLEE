{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and it's a fair price for me considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price, but still gives me a good profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given that the product is only worth $1,200,000 to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this strikes a balance between the value you place on the product and my valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I want to try and push for a higher price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which reflects a compromise on both our ends.  I believe this price still provides you with a good value, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'll consider the compromise you've presented. To continue moving forward, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000. This aims to be closer to your needs while also staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum.  Since this is a good deal for both of us, I think it's best to accept his offer and close the deal.  There's always a chance that I might get a better deal in a future round, but it's not guaranteed, and I risk losing a solid sale."
