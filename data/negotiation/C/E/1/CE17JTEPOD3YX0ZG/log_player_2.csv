"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $100.  You can potentially save more money by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the offer, Bob, but I can't go as low as $85.  Would you consider $95? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

While $95 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your ideal price. You can potentially get a lower price by making another counteroffer."
