"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to find a way to purchase the product for a bit less. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90? That's still a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $87 for the product. I hope this suggestion is within your acceptable range.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $87 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about we meet in the middle at $89? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the sale.",89.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a final price of $88 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope it works for you as well.",88.0,Bob,6,
