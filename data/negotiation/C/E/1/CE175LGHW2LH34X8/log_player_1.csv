{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $95, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive message encourages Bob to engage.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies that I'm open to discussion, which can lead to a more favorable outcome.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and understand his willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to counter-offer if he rejects this price, but I'll always have the option of selling to John for $100 if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to find a way to purchase the product for a bit less. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is significantly lower than my starting point of $95 and is also below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below what I believe it's worth.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer. This will allow me to test his willingness to pay more and keep the possibility of a sale at a higher price.  If he continues to insist on $85, I can always sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90? That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone, hoping to keep the negotiation going.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise, I'm testing Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price.  If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I can still go back to my original offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $87 for the product. I hope this suggestion is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved slightly closer to my desired price, $87 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer again with a price closer to $90. If Bob continues to insist on a price below my minimum, I will sell to John for $100 to ensure I don't lose money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $87 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about we meet in the middle at $89? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 89}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a final compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows that I'm serious about selling to him, but I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Finality:** My message implies that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. If he rejects it, I'll sell to John for $100. This strategy ensures that I will get at least my minimum price for the product while still trying to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a final price of $88 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope it works for you as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $88 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss, even for a small amount.

**Strategy:**

Since I've already reached my limit for negotiation and Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price, it's more advantageous to sell to John for $100. This ensures that I receive a profit on the product and avoids further negotiation that might not be fruitful."
