"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and secure a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
