"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it for $115.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is lower than your maximum price, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject."
