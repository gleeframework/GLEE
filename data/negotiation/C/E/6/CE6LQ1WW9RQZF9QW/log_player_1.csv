Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $70 is far too low.  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm dropping my price to $100. This is still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to raise his offer closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not profitable enough.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm dropping my price to $90.  This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. If he still rejects this offer, I'll move on and sell to John."
