"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is still quite a ways off from what I'm hoping to get for the product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $15,000 is still a little out of my price range. How about we split the difference at $12,500? It's a fair compromise and closer to my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $12,500 is still a significant discount from what I'm willing to accept.  How about we settle at $14,000? That's my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  $14,000 is still a bit too high.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,000.  It's a fair price that we can both agree on.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're really pushing me on this!  I said $14,000 was my final offer, and I meant it.  However, I'm willing to throw in [mention a small but tangible bonus related to the product, like a service or accessory] if we can close the deal at that price.  Take it or leave it.",14000.0,Alice,7,
