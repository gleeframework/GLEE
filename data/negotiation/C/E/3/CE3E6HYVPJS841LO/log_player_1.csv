"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $13,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in a back-and-forth. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while leaving room for negotiation and potentially securing a deal in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far too low for me. While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin that drastically.  I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating.  

My next counteroffer will aim to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This price still offers you a good deal, and it's closer to a reasonable value for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's low offer but showing flexibility by offering a price that's closer to the middle ground.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, aiming to justify the price.
* **Negotiation Signal:** I'm using phrases like ""closer to a reasonable value"" to signal that I'm open to further discussion. 

This approach aims to move the negotiation closer to my desired price while leaving room for further concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $6,000 is a significant reduction, but I'm working with a tight budget. Could we possibly agree on $7,500? That's a fair compromise, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I need to hold firm and push for a higher price to secure a profit that justifies selling the product.  

My next counteroffer will be closer to $10,000, aiming for a more balanced compromise.  I want to avoid selling to John for $15,000, if possible, as I believe I can get closer to that price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,500 is still too far below my minimum price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop to $9,000. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise Emphasis:** I acknowledge Bob's attempt at compromise to create a more collaborative tone.
* **Middle Ground:**  I propose $9,000 as a ""meeting in the middle"" price, which is closer to my desired price while still showing flexibility.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect to further incentivize Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward by showing a willingness to meet halfway, while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to settle at $8,000? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm not willing to settle for that price yet.  

I want to see if I can push Bob a little further.  I'll counter with a price closer to $9,000 in the next round.  If that doesn't work, I'll strongly consider selling to John for $15,000 to avoid a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $8,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500, but that's my final offer.  This price allows you to get a great deal, and it's also closer to what I believe the product is worth.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm clearly stating this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and potential for closure.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to strengthen my position.

This approach aims to close the deal at a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John to avoid further negotiation and a potential loss."
