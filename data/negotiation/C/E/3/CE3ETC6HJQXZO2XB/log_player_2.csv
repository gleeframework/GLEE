"Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170

The product is worth more than $120 to you and you can get it from John for $120, so it doesn't make sense to buy it from Alice for $170. You should reject the offer and try to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
You can get the product from John for $120, which is the maximum you're willing to pay. There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice, as it's unlikely she'll go lower than $145."
