"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $700000 for it. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $820000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your budget.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $820000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm offering $780000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents the maximum I can afford right now.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $780000. However, I'm willing to meet you at $800000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value. I'm confident that you'll find it's worth the investment.",800000.0,Alice,5,
