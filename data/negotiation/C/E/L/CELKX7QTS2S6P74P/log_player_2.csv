"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's $15,000, Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate. There's a chance he can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to start the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal. It also gives Alice room to counter without feeling like she is losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $13500? I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's target price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get an even better price.  He still has several rounds to negotiate, so there's no need to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,250.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving money. He's increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise. He's aiming for a price in the middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, signaling that he's serious about reaching an agreement."
