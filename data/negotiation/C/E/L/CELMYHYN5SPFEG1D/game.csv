,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, which I appreciate.  However, $77.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $82.50, and I'm willing to go no lower than that.  It's a fair compromise, and I think we can close this deal.",82.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $80?  That's the highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
