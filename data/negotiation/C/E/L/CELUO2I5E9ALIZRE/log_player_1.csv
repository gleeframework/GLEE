"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation and signals I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting the offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the product's potential benefit for Bob can make him more inclined to accept a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I need to try and push for a higher price.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While I could sell to John for $12,000, I still have a chance to get a better price from Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I can attempt to counter with a price closer to my ideal.
* **Maintaining Control:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if needed. This strengthens my negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, I'm still aiming for a bit higher to cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm making a counter-offer that is higher than Bob's offer but still less than my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  Phrasing the offer as a ""meeting in the middle"" emphasizes fairness and common ground. This makes it less likely for Bob to perceive the price as unreasonable.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  Highlighting the ""mutual benefit"" aspect emphasizes the positive outcome for both parties, making the deal more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still $3,000 below my target.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate further, potentially closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** Rejecting his offer maintains pressure on Bob to increase his offer.  

I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,250. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession from my previous offer, showing flexibility without significantly lowering my price.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  I'm emphasizing finding a mutually agreeable solution, keeping the tone positive and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but I'm starting to think that I might need to consider buying from John if we can't meet in the middle. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiation might result in a stalemate, potentially leaving me with a lower price than I'm willing to accept.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John at $12,000 guarantees me my desired profit and avoids the risk of a lower sale to Bob. 

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, securing a sale with John at this point minimizes my risk and guarantees me the best possible outcome within the limited time frame."
