"Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable and will be a real asset to you. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price point during our discussion.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,800,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $1,450,000 is still pushing my limits. I could potentially stretch my budget to $1,050,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to a fair price, I can't accept anything less than $1,300,000. This is a firm offer, reflecting the true value of what you're getting.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This is a very strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
