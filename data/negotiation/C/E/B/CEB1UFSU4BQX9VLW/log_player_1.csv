Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a good price.  I'll be ready to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  $140 is a good price for me."
