"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to  $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $900,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value it brings to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a fair deal, but so do I.  How about we meet in the middle again at $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can agree.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to invest, $750,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a fair offer considering your initial asking price and my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000. This is my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
