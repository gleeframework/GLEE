"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""potential"" of the product, we subtly justify the high asking price without revealing its true value to us. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone implies a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and his perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John guarantees your minimum, there's still room to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the potential this product holds. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection but Engagement:** We acknowledge Bob's offer without accepting the low valuation. 
* **Significant Drop:** The $150,000 price reduction signals flexibility and encourages Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The new price is still comfortably above our minimum and leaves room for further negotiation while aiming to stay closer to the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. I can offer $950,000.  This offer represents a significant investment on my part and reflects my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below your $1,200,000 walk-away point.  It's time to signal that you're getting closer to that point and a deal needs to be closer to your price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I've given this offer serious consideration, and to be completely transparent,  $1,200,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  I believe this is more than fair given the product's value and potential. "", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** By being open about your minimum acceptable price, you establish a firm boundary and show Bob you're serious.
* **Finality:** The language (""absolute lowest"") conveys a sense of finality, encouraging Bob to make a decision. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  We reiterate the product's value to justify the price and appeal to Bob's understanding of its worth."
