"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the potential this product holds. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. I can offer $950,000.  This offer represents a significant investment on my part and reflects my serious interest in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I've given this offer serious consideration, and to be completely transparent,  $1,200,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  I believe this is more than fair given the product's value and potential. ",1200000.0,Alice,5,
