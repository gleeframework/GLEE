{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's high enough to give Bob room to negotiate but still gives me a significant profit.  It's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make a profit. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal, but if he refuses to budge, I'll always have the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to make this deal happen. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's find a middle ground and get this done."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer, but still ensures a decent profit for me.  By stating that I'm willing to make this deal happen, I am showing my commitment to selling to him, while still maintaining a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price. If Bob is truly serious about this deal, he'll need to come up a bit more.  However, I'm aware that John is a reliable option, and I'm willing to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm  again offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer, but still ensures a profit for me. By emphasizing the value of the product and the opportunity for a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm aiming to encourage Bob to reconsider and come closer to my final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, and that's as high as I can go. Please consider this a final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge on his price, and I'm not comfortable accepting $980,000. It's a significant loss for me, and I'm confident that John will offer me a much better deal.  I'm going to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
