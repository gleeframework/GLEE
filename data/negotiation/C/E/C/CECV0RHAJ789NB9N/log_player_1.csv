Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love!  I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering the product at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm open to negotiating further if Bob rejects my initial offer.
* **Knowing my backup:**  I'm aware that I can sell the product to John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! While I do like the product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** While I'm not willing to accept $6,500, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $6,500 is a little lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but significantly lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while keeping the price within a reasonable range.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing that $8,500 is still a good deal for Bob, reminding him of the product's value.
* **Mutual benefit:** I'm framing the negotiation as a way to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This fosters a more positive and cooperative tone. 
* **Next steps:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation if Bob still needs to come down in price."
