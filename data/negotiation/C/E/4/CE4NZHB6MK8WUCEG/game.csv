"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire [Product Name].  However, $1000000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price.  Let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let's find a middle ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position. While I acknowledge the product's value, $900000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000, my absolute maximum.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the product's true worth. Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
