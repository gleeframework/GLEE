Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire [Product Name] for a price of $1,000,000. It's a truly unique asset with incredible potential. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, but I'm open to discussion. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire [Product Name].  However, $1000000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $800,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. While I acknowledge the product's value, $900000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000, my absolute maximum.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the product's true worth. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum requirement.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing it by continuing to negotiate."
