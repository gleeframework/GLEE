{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's significantly higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also includes a positive and encouraging message, aimed at making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $17,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that we'll reach an agreement, and I risk wasting more time. I'm better off selling the product to John for $15,000, which is a guaranteed profit."
