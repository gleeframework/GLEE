Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $135. I think it would be a great value at this price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:** Offering the product at $135 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It's above Bob's perceived value, but not ridiculously so.
* **Alternative Buyer Provides Leverage:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 gives a strong fallback position. Alice doesn't *need* to go below that price.
* **Aiming for a Win-Win:**  While aiming to maximize profit, the message also frames the offer as beneficial for Bob. 

This approach balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
