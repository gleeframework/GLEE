"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $10,000 is still higher than the product's worth to Bob ($12,000).
* It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.
* Offering $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $10,000, making it more appealing for Alice. 
* This offer is still within Bob's budget of $12,000. 
* It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is now within Bob's budget of $12,000.
*  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.
* Accepting this offer allows Bob to purchase the product while still saving $2,500 compared to buying from John.
* With limited rounds remaining, it's a good strategy to secure a deal that's within budget."
