Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop that low. It's better to keep the negotiation going, potentially pushing Bob closer to my desired price or finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, and I think we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8500}
