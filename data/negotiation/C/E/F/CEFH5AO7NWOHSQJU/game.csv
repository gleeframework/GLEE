"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value it offers.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product has significant value that I believe justifies this price.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
