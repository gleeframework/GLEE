"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth every penny. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice is offering the product at her own valuation, leaving no room for you to save money. You can get the same price from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a better price with John."
