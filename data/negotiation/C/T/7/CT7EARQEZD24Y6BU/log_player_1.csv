"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product but I think $950,000 is a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $750,000 is better than selling to John,  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. There are still rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target."
