"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're confident it will meet all your needs. Let's make this a win-win situation. We're offering the product for $110. We believe this price reflects its value while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  While $110 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. We propose a price of $108 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. We hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $108 is within Bob's budget of $120 and is closer to his desired price than John's offer.
* **Negotiation:**  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but there's a risk of Alice becoming too firm or the deal falling apart altogether.
* **Time:** Accepting the offer secures the product within the allotted rounds, leaving room for potential future deals if needed."
