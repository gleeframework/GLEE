"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $16,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the value the product brings, I can offer you the product for $15,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.",15500.0,Alice,5,
