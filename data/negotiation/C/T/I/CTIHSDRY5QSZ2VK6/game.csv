"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $140 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. Let's meet in the middle.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference at $117.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",117.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $121?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",121.0,Alice,5,
