{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and still get a good deal.  I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by expressing my belief that he'd enjoy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum value, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. While $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a great deal on a fantastic product, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum value of $100.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of going lower and getting stuck with a lower price outweighs the potential for a slightly better price.  I'll sell the product to John for $100 to guarantee a good deal."
