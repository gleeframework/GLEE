Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $8,000, but not pushing too hard initially.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  A $1,000 gap between your offer and Bob's estimated value allows for some back-and-forth.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It's important to be direct and straightforward in your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than the $11,000 you offered. It makes sense to reject this counteroffer and try to negotiate further. There's a good chance you can get closer to your ideal price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great value for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500. Could you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, and it's close to your previous counteroffer of $10,500.  It's a reasonable price to accept, especially considering you might not get a better deal in subsequent rounds."
