"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $10,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000, you know you have another option with John. Since you want to save as much money as possible, it's worth seeing if Alice will lower her price further or rejecting her offer to see if you can get a better deal from John."
