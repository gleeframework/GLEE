"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000.  Would that be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $825,000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
