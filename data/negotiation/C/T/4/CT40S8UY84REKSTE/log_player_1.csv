Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You are still open to making a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps keep the negotiation focused. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response and the potential value of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price from Bob before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, Bob's offer of $92.50 is a good compromise. It's still above my minimum of $120 and it shows that Bob is willing to negotiate. There's a good chance that if I reject this offer, he might walk away, forcing me to sell to John for $120."
