"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's worth $15,000 to you, so you'd be getting a great deal! If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to sell it to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can save $1,000 by buying from John. Alice's attempts to create urgency (another buyer) and inflate the perceived value ($15,000) shouldn't sway you from your goal of maximizing savings."
