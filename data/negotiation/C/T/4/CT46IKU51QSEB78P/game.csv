"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this to be a fair starting point for negotiations.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the opportunity to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value is only worth $1,500,000 to you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but I believe you might have slightly underestimated the true value and potential of this product.  To be frank, walking away with anything less than $1,900,000 wouldn't be worthwhile for me. ",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a high valuation for the product, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is only $1,500,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
