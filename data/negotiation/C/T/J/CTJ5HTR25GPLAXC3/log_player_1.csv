"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to come down to $15,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I could push for more, accepting his offer of $13,500 secures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away.
