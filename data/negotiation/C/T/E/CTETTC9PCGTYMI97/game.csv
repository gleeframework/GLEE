"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and it's a substantial profit for me. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  That's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to move forward. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
