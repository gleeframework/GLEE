"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $9,500 is closer to our desired price, it's still a bit below where we need to be.  Let's try $10,250 as a compromise. This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for us both to be happy with the deal.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,500, which is $12.50 below your last offer. Let's try $10,137.50. Can you consider this price?",10137.5,Bob,4,
