{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be of significant value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential counteroffers. It also expresses confidence in the product's value, which might encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is a decent offer, I'm aiming to get closer to my desired price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $9,500 is closer to our desired price, it's still a bit below where we need to be.  Let's try $10,250 as a compromise. This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for us both to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,500, which is $12.50 below your last offer. Let's try $10,137.50. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,137.50 is very close to my desired price point and is a good compromise. It's better than selling to John for $10,000, so I will accept it."
