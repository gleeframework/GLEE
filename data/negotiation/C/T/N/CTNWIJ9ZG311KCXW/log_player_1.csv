Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. This is a time-sensitive offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **50% Markup:** Offering the product at $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for potential negotiation while aiming for a significantly higher profit. 
* **Scarcity and Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""time-sensitive offer"" to create a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he doesn't act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your absolute floor in the negotiation should be $1,500,001 to ensure you make more than selling to John."
