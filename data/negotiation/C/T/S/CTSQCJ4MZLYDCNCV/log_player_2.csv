"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's price at this point.  By rejecting, he can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  He knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so he starts with a significant counteroffer at $1,000,000.  This gives Alice room to negotiate while still leaving Bob with a substantial profit compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price, but it is lower than John's price. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating with Alice. He can try to get a lower price closer to his initial counteroffer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He increased his offer from $1,000,000 to $1,100,000, which is still significantly lower than Alice's offer of $1,350,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save a considerable amount compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to John's price of $1,500,000. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are minimal.  It's more efficient for Bob to purchase the product from John to avoid further negotiation and ensure a quick and secure deal."
