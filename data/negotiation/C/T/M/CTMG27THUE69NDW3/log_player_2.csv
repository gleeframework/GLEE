"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to you and still allows me to make a substantial profit.  Let me know if you're interested, but I'll need a decision soon as I have another buyer waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Buying from Alice saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **You still get a good deal.** While you're paying more than the product is worth to Alice, it's still significantly less than what you'd be willing to pay."
