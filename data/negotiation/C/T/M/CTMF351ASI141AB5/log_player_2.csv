Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $9,750. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly decreasing her price.  At this rate, it's unlikely she'll go down to a price that beats John's offer of $10,000 before the rounds run out. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the product from John at the best known price."
