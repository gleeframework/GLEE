# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This is a great price, considering the product is worth $1000000 to you. I'm confident you'll make a smart investment by purchasing it from me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  He can get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is the best deal for him."
