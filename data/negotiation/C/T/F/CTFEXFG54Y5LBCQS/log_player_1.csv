"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price well above your minimum. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""immense value and potential"" subtly reinforces the high price without directly revealing your bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Clearly stating this is a ""starting point for negotiations"" encourages Bob to engage in the process even if he finds the initial price high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,800,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the market value and the potential returns. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, it's still significantly above his perceived value. This means there's room for negotiation.  You're willing to go lower, but not immediately accept his first counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is closer to the mark, the value of this product really is significant. How about we meet halfway at $2,025,000? This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while acknowledging the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 2025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  By proposing a price exactly halfway between your last offer ($2,250,000) and his ($1,800,000), you signal fairness and willingness to move. 
* **Value Reaffirmation:**  Reiterating the product's value keeps it in focus and justifies a price point above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer helps gauge Bob's flexibility and how serious he is about purchasing.  If he readily accepts, you might have aimed too low. If he rejects it, you still have room to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Considering the market value and the potential returns, I'm willing to pay $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating strategically, but he's still a significant distance from your minimum price. He's only increased his offer by $50,000. It's time to show him that you're serious about your valuation and willing to walk away if needed.  You'll reject this offer, but in the next round, consider offering a price closer to your minimum to see if he bites."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to understand that this product has a very high value for me. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to honor our negotiations, but only if you can offer a price that reflects the true value. Is $1,900,000 something you can work with?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introduce Competition:** By mentioning John and his offer, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity. Bob knows now that he's not your only option.
* **Reveal (Part of) Your Bottom Line:** You haven't explicitly stated your minimum, but you've heavily implied it by revealing John's offer. This signals to Bob that you're serious and won't go much lower.
* **Final Offer (Almost):**  The price of $1,900,000 is still above your absolute minimum, giving you a little wiggle room while making it clear to Bob this is likely your best offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Considering the market value and the potential returns, I'm willing to pay $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is not budging significantly even after you introduced competition and essentially revealed your bottom line. His latest offer is still $200,000 away from your minimum, and he's only moving in small increments.  This suggests he's unlikely to meet your price.  It's time to cut your losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
