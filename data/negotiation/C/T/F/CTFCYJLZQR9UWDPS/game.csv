"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can go. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $9,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for.
