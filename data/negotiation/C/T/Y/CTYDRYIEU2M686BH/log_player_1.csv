Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $9,500 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially reaching a price higher than $10,000. 
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price might make Bob more receptive than a significantly higher offer. 

**Why not offer a lower price?**

While I could offer a lower price (e.g., $8,500) to ensure Bob accepts, it's riskier. Bob might be willing to pay more, and I'd lose potential profit. This strategy aims to balance profit maximization with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
