"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18000 for the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. While I am interested in the product, my budget for it is $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $12000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $9500? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $11000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
