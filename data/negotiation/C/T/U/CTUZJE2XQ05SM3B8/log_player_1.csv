"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($120). This gives me room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly message can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation and be more receptive to my offer. 
* **First Round:** In the first round, it's important to test the waters and see how Bob reacts to the offer.  

**Note:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm also aware of the option to sell to John for $120, so if the negotiation with Bob drags on or becomes too difficult, I can always opt for that option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's still lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.
* **Negotiation Room:** I have room to negotiate further and try to get a higher price. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to Bob at $90 would mean a significant loss for me. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John is offering a guaranteed $120, I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a better price. 

**Next Step:**

In the next round, I'll send Bob a counteroffer closer to my desired price, but still within a range that's likely to be acceptable to him.  I'll need to be careful not to push him away completely, but also try to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $100 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $100, which is closer to his offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product offers to emphasize that my price is still reasonable.
* **Urgency:** I'm suggesting a potential agreement to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a win-win situation where Bob feels he's getting a good deal, and I'm getting a fair price. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still a significant loss for me. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** We've made progress, and there's still potential to negotiate a higher price.  
* **John's Offer:** While John is offering a guaranteed $120, I'm not desperate to sell. I have several rounds left with Bob and I'm confident I can get a better price. 

**Next Step:** 

In the next round, I'll counter Bob's offer with something slightly higher than $95. I want to keep the negotiation moving forward but also ensure I'm getting closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $97.50. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's current offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that it's a fair price for both of us, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the possibility of closing the deal to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* By offering a price halfway between Bob's offer and my previous one, I show that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not desperate.
* I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired price range, while still being reasonable enough for Bob to accept. 
*  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or move on to John."
