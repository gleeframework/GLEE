Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:**  Offering the product for $120 allows for some negotiation room while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Potential for Profit:** If Bob accepts this offer, you make a $40 profit.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum price, ensuring you don't lose out. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
