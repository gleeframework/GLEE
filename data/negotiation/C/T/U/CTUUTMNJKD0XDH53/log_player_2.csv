"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer. There's a good chance Alice will accept a price closer to her desired $1,000,000, allowing Bob to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still represents a profit for her. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while also trying to secure a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now lower than John's price, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a price lower than $1,100,000.  Bob should accept Alice's offer to secure the product at a better price than John's."
