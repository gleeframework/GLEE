I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant amount for me, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is still a decent amount, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price just yet. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
