Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,150,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is firm (""take-it-or-leave-it""), the price leaves some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slightly better deal. 
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a strong anchor price can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk Tolerance:** This is a bold offer. If Bob is price-sensitive, he might reject it, and Alice would have to settle for $1,000,000 from John.
* **Information:**  This assumes Alice doesn't know for certain that Bob values the product at $1,200,000. If she had more information, she might adjust her strategy."
