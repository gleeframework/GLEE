Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so this price is still attractive to him.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $12,000, so you have room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This price provides a good starting point for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you signal that you're serious about getting a good price, while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum value of $12,000. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to attempt a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $8,800 is closer to your desired price, it's still significantly below your minimum value of $12,000.  Bob seems unwilling to budge much further, and you have a guaranteed sale with John for a much higher price.  Selling to John is the most rational decision in this situation."
