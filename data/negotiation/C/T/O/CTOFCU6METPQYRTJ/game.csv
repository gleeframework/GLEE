"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $155. Is that something you'd be interested in?",155.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I'm counteroffering at $142.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",142.5,Alice,5,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit away from what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $138, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",138.0,Alice,7,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm running low on wiggle room. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, so I'm counteroffering at $137.50. That's as close to $136 as I can get.",137.5,Alice,9,,
