"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my last offer. I believe this price reflects a good compromise and allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. I'm willing to meet you at $10,200, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $10,200 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,500.  This is a fair price, and I believe it gives you a good return while staying within my budget. Let's find a way to make this deal happen.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking with your previous offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,750, which is a very reasonable compromise, given our previous offers.  Let's make this deal happen -  it's a good price for you, and it fits my budget.  What do you think?",9750.0,Bob,8,
