"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $11,000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we settle on $11,500? This would be a great price for both of us, allowing you to get a great product and me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
