Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $11,000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we settle on $11,500? This would be a great price for both of us, allowing you to get a great product and me to make a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate and has met you closer to the middle ground.  While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk Alice might become less flexible. Accepting the $11,500 offer secures you the product at a price significantly lower than her initial offer and a decent savings compared to John's price."
