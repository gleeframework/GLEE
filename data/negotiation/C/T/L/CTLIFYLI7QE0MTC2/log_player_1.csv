"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation ($12,000) but significantly lower than my minimum ($15,000). 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get, making the offer appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This allows for back-and-forth to find a middle ground. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.
* If the negotiation stalls, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000.
* I'll aim to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially finding a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** I can secure a much better price by selling to John, so it's not worth accepting such a low offer from Bob. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiations.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer, aiming for a compromise.
* I'll keep the option to sell to John open in case the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price significantly from my previous offer but remain above Bob's offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:**  I've highlighted the value of the product to reiterate its worth.
* **Open-ended Question:** I've asked Bob for his opinion, inviting further discussion and potentially leading to a final agreement.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to find a middle ground with Bob and avoid having to sell to John at this point.
* If Bob doesn't accept, I'll continue negotiating while keeping the option to sell to John open.
* I'm confident that $12,500 is a fair price, considering both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While closer to my desired price, $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Selling to John remains a strong option:** I can secure a much better price by selling to John, so accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Further negotiation is possible:** There's still room to negotiate a better price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still higher than his. I'll emphasize the value proposition of the product and aim to find a compromise.
* I'll continue to keep the option of selling to John open, as it remains the best alternative if negotiations fail."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $11,000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we settle on $11,500? This would be a great price for both of us, allowing you to get a great product and me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. It shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I've emphasized the ""great deal"" for both of us, highlighting the benefits for Bob and reinforcing the value of the product.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I've asked Bob for his opinion, inviting further discussion and potentially leading to a final agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a compromise:** I'm aiming to find a price that both Bob and I can accept. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  While $11,500 isn't my ideal price, it's significantly better than selling to John, making it a more desirable option.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary, but I'm confident this offer represents a fair and reasonable price."
