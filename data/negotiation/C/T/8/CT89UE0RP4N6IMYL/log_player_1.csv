Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000). This allows for room to negotiate downwards without compromising my desired profit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can still secure a decent profit. 

I'm prepared to negotiate further depending on Bob's response."
