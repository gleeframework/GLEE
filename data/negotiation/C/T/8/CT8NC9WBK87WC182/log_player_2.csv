# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can potentially get the product for a lower price by counter-offering.  $950,000 is still too high, and it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know your thoughts.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $900,000 is a better price than her initial offer, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. He can counter-offer again and see if Alice will go lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $890,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At this point, he's gotten the price down to $890,000.  Any further negotiation might risk Alice walking away, and then he'd be forced to buy from John at $1,000,000.  This is a good deal for Bob, saving him $110,000."
