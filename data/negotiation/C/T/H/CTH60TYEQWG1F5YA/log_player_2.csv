"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still potentially get a better deal from Alice by counteroffering.  He has room to negotiate since he values the product at $1,500,000 and Alice is willing to sell for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1300000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1350000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget and a good compromise. Accepting this offer saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John. While there's still room for negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting a further counteroffer and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings of a few more rounds of negotiation."
