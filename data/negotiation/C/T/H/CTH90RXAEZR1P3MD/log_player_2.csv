"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be very valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still too high. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $12,500? "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counter-offer, aiming to land close to the midpoint between Alice's minimum value and his own maximum value. This approach shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also signals his willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,250 is a better offer than the initial $14,000, it's still above Bob's target price. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $13,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm but showing flexibility by increasing his offer slightly.  He's aiming for a price that's closer to his initial offer and represents a reasonable compromise for both parties."
