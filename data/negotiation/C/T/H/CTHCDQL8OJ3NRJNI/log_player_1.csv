Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($18,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value, hoping to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Fairness:**  While the price is high, the message frames it as ""fair"" to soften the blow and keep the negotiation open.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response (or counteroffer) and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he's too low, I might counteroffer or consider selling to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is my absolute minimum, and I'm not willing to sell at that price yet.
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, so there's still potential to reach a higher price.
* **Counteroffering:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to find a price that's more favorable for me.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial asking price, but still higher than Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you considering my product. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $15,000? It's still a great deal considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price to $15,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price and make it seem like a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for Loss:**  If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or I'll be forced to sell to John for $12,000 anyway.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit, which is more important than trying to squeeze out a few extra dollars and potentially losing the deal.

**Next Steps:**

Since I've accepted the offer, the negotiation is complete. I'll proceed with the sale to Bob and finalize the transaction."
