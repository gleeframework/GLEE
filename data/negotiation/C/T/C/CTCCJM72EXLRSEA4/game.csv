"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I believe $1,400,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,100,000 falls quite a bit short of the true value this product offers.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,200,000. Would you consider $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
