"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am only willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a significant step away from its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This feels like a fair deal considering the benefits you'll gain.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I can't go above $1,250,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it offers. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
