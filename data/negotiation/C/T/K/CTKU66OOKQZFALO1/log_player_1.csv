This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you are willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below the product's worth to me.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation before selling to John."
