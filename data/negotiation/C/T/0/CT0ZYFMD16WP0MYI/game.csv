"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However,  $120 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $100 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for that price. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $100, as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $110. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other buyers.",110.0,Alice,5,
