Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going under, as John guarantees us $1,200,000.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming high. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the price without revealing our bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone encourages Bob to engage in discussion and potentially counter-offer.

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob accepts the $1,150,000, securing us a good profit. If he negotiates down, we have room to maneuver knowing John provides a safety net at our minimum acceptable price."
