"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable item that will bring you great benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $15,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get it sold.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $15,500. It's a fair price for both of us and lets us reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from my initial offer of $18,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $15,750. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can understand my position.",15750.0,Alice,5,
