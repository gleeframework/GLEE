"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $180 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for it, which is what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. It's a fair compromise considering the value I think the product holds for you.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $157.50, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us.",157.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $157.50 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $160, which is a bit closer to my original price, but still a fair compromise considering the value I think the product holds for you.",160.0,Alice,5,
