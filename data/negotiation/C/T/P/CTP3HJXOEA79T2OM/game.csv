"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in this product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1100000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1300000? This allows me to make a reasonable profit while still being a fair price for you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point.  Let's split the difference and go with $1250000. I believe this would be a good compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
