"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire something valuable for your business. I'm confident this will be a win-win for both of us.  My initial price is $1200000. This reflects the significant value the product holds.  I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1200000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer to make this work. Let's split the difference â€“  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1025000.  This gives us both a good deal and allows me to recover a significant portion of the value I've placed on this product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1025000 is still out of my range.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to recover a significant portion of its value.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, $900000 still falls short of what this product is worth.  I'm willing to make another concession, but it needs to be a significant one.  I'm offering the product for $975000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still allowing you to acquire it at a competitive rate. Let's finalize this deal, Bob.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and value this product, but $975000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to push my limit to $925000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This would allow us to finalize this deal, saving both of us time and resources.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate it. However, $925000 is still not enough to meet my expectations.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm ready to offer the product for $950000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while still giving you a significant advantage. Let's finalize this deal, Bob. We're so close!",950000.0,Alice,7,
