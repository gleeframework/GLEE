"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire something valuable for your business. I'm confident this will be a win-win for both of us.  My initial price is $1,200,000. This reflects the significant value the product holds.  I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1200000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 10 rounds, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  

I'll reject this offer and counter with a higher price. I want to see if I can leverage the fact that Bob is interested and move him closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer to make this work. Let's split the difference â€“  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,025,000.  This gives us both a good deal and allows me to recover a significant portion of the value I've placed on this product."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1025000 is still out of my range.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to recover a significant portion of its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still far too low for the value I place on the product. I've already made concessions, and I believe I can push Bob higher. 

With 6 rounds remaining, I have room to keep negotiating. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my target. My goal is to maximize my profit, and I believe I can achieve that by continuing the negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, $900,000 still falls short of what this product is worth.  I'm willing to make another concession, but it needs to be a significant one.  I'm offering the product for $975,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still allowing you to acquire it at a competitive rate. Let's finalize this deal, Bob."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and value this product, but $975000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to push my limit to $925000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This would allow us to finalize this deal, saving both of us time and resources. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
