# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal for Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a better offer than $1,200,000, it's still beyond Bob's budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is a better offer than before, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob is now faced with a choice:

* **Continue negotiating:**  There's a chance Alice might go even lower, but it's also possible the negotiation will drag on further.
* **Buy from John:**  This guarantees Bob the product for his maximum budget.

Given the potential for further negotiation, it's a calculated risk. However, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and buying from John guarantees the lowest price within his budget."
