"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would still be a profitable deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. It gives you a good profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal and move forward.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to close the deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $885,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",885000.0,Alice,5,
