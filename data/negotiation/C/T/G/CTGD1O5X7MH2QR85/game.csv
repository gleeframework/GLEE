"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the starting price of $20,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
