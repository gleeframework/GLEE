"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is far above my maximum budget of $800,000.
* It's worth trying to negotiate a better price. I have 10 rounds, so there's room to make counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This represents a significant gain for you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still too high for me. 
* While she claims it's a ""significant concession"", it's not enough to reach a deal within my budget.
* I will continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're aiming for a higher price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a considerable increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product for me. I'm eager to reach an agreement, so let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $950,000 is still $550,000 below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and my minimum price, which would be $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still well above my budget. 
* It seems she's unwilling to budge much further. 
*  While I'm only halfway through the negotiation rounds, it's looking increasingly unlikely that Alice will come down to a price I'm comfortable with. 
*  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $800,000, as that's the most cost-effective option at this point."
