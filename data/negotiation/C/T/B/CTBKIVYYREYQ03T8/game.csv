"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000. This product is valuable to me, but I'm not sure it's worth $800,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $750,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
