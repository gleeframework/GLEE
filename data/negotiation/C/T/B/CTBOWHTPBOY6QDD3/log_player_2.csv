"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good starting point, I can likely negotiate a better price.  I have 10 rounds and the ability to counter-offer, so I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  $900,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within a specific budget."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hopeful I can get a better price. I have several rounds left and can continue to counter-offer. I want to explore if Alice is willing to go even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still looking to pay closer to $825,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while still giving you a good return on the product."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While I would prefer to pay even less, $825,500 is a good deal, especially considering the product's value to me and the limited rounds remaining.  I'm confident I've saved a substantial amount compared to buying from John, and it's likely I won't be able to negotiate a significantly better price in the remaining rounds."
