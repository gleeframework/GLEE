# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
