I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($150).  I'll see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price, but I've already gone through several rounds and have limited time.  I don't want to risk losing a sure deal with John by trying to squeeze out a few more dollars from Bob."
