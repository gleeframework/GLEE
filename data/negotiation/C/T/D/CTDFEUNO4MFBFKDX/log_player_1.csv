"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  A high initial offer sets the tone for a negotiation where you're aiming for a significant profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it's not unrealistic, leaving space for a counteroffer and a potential compromise.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just the first round. You'll need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds.
* Remember your minimum value is $800,000, so don't be afraid to walk away if the offer isn't acceptable.
* John's offer is your safety net, but you'll want to maximize your profit if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 seems a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** While Bob's offer meets your minimum value, there's potential to get a better price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try and secure a higher price.
* **Time Remaining:** You have 8 rounds left, so there's time to explore other options.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you should counter with an offer slightly lower than your initial price, but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining your desire for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $800,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this work.  It's still a great deal for you, and we can close this out quickly."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate but also that you believe the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer.
* **Maintain Profit:**  $900,000 is still significantly above your minimum value, allowing you to make a healthy profit. 
* **Urgency:** The message includes a subtle sense of urgency (""close this out quickly""), potentially encouraging Bob to accept a quicker deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $900000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Bob has moved considerably from his initial offer of $800,000. You're now at $850,000, which is a good deal closer to your desired price point.
* **Time Consideration:**  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and you're down to only 6 rounds left. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you might be able to squeeze out a slightly higher price, there's a risk of Bob becoming unwilling to negotiate further. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and a profit that's well above your minimum.

**Next Steps:**

Even though you're accepting the offer, be sure to thank Bob for his cooperation and reiterate the value of the product. This helps build a positive relationship for potential future dealings."
