"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $100, which is fair for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",100.0,Bob,4,
