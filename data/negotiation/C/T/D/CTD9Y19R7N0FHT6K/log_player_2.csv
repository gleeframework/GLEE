"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can save up to $1,000 by getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $8750. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

You're still closer to your target price with John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $8,250? That's a fair compromise that's closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to consider your proposal, Bob. However, I think the product's value is slightly higher than that. I can offer it to you for $8500. It's a compromise that's closer to my original price, but still a bit more affordable for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you are $500 below your limit and have only 5 rounds left. While you could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. You're better off securing the product at this price, especially with John's offer as a backup."
