"Hi Alice, I think the product sounds interesting, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $135.  That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I think that's a more reasonable price for me.",125.0,Bob,4,
