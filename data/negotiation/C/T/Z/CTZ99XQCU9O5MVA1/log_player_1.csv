Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($10,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves a potential $1,000 profit for Bob, making it a tempting offer.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly (implying other buyers), you create a sense of urgency and remind Bob of the potential loss if he declines.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, ensuring you don't lose out completely if Bob rejects the offer."
