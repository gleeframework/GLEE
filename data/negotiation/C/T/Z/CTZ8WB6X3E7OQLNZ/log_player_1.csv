"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

I'm not willing to accept a price that's less than what I know the product is worth to me.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value I know it holds for you, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware of my options.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can come to a better agreement."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can agree on a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

I've decided to sell to John. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't close the deal with Bob,  I've reached a point where the offers are not reaching my minimum expectations, and  I'm running out of rounds.  It's best to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
