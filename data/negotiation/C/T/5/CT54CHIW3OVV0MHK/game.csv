"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  To make this work, I can come down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $17,000. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit shy of that price. Can you meet me at $14,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
