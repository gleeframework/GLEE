"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize my potential profit, but I'm mindful that Bob has a clear value for the product and won't accept a price too far above that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is a decent offer, it's still a bit below where I want to be. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000.  This is a compromise between Bob's offer and my initial asking price. I'm confident that Bob will see this as a fair price, and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good offer from Bob, and it's only $500 less than my counteroffer. We're getting close to an agreeable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  $16,500 is a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it."
