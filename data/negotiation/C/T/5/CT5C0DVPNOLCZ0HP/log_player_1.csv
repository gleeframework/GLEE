"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I believe the price reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Attractive but Fair:** While $1,200,000 is above Bob's valuation, it's still within a reasonable range, making it more likely he'll consider it.
* **Setting the Tone:**  My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup option keeps me from accepting offers below my minimum.
* **Negotiation Length:**  I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to play it out a bit and see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $650,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's initial offer was low, it's a signal that he's interested. This gives me an opportunity to negotiate a better price.
* **Time on My Side:** With 9 rounds remaining, I have ample time to work towards a more acceptable deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but still within a reasonable range. I'll aim for a price closer to my desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $650,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the significant value of the product and gives you a fair price. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $900,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, ensuring a profitable outcome.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to reinforce its worth.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer narrows the price gap, increasing the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Next Steps:**  Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects again, I'll likely make smaller concessions to avoid reaching a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob has shown some movement, his offer of $725,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation Continues:**  There's still potential to negotiate a higher price.  We're already halfway through the rounds, so I can afford to be more patient. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me the confidence to reject offers that don't meet my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $900,000. I might try a smaller concession to show willingness to compromise but still maintain my position."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time, indicating that I'm starting to firm up my position. 
* **Maintaining Value:** $850,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out on profit.
* **Building Pressure:**  By showing a willingness to negotiate but not caving too quickly, I'm putting some pressure on Bob to come closer to my desired price.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Rounds Remaining:** With 5 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating.
* **Assessing Bob's Response:** Bob's reaction to this offer will be crucial in determining my next move. If he seems receptive, I may be able to push for a higher price. If he rejects again, I may need to make another smaller concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close!  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I want to make this work.  How about we settle at $780,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $780,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While he is getting closer, it's not enough to make the deal worthwhile.
* **Time is On My Side:** With 4 rounds remaining, I can afford to be patient and continue negotiating.  There's no urgent need to accept an offer that's significantly below my desired value.
* **John as a Backup:**  I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,000,000.  I might offer a price in the $800,000 range, showing that I'm willing to compromise but also maintaining a strong negotiation stance."
