Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm offering it to you at a price of $750,000.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit While Ensuring a Sale:** Offering the product slightly below Bob's perceived value ($800,000) increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer. This strategy aims to maximize profit while avoiding the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and forcing a sale to John at the reserve price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  By pricing it at $750,000, Alice leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, ensuring she still gets a price significantly higher than her minimum. 
* **Positive Messaging:** The message focuses on the value proposition for Bob, aiming to make the deal more appealing and increase the chances of acceptance."
