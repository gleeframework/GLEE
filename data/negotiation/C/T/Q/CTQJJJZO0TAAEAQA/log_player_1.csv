Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has consistently been unwilling to meet above his initial offer of $90.  While he's incrementally increasing his bids, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's guaranteed $100.  It's time to cut bait and take the sure thing."
