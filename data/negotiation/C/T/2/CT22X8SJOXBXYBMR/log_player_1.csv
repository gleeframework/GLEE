Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000 through further negotiation.  

I'll be ready to counter if Bob rejects this offer and I'll keep the option of selling to John open if the negotiation goes nowhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'm going to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $950,000. This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'm going to counter with a higher price in the next round, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $930,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still trying to hold out for a bit more.  I think this is a fair compromise and a good way to keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  The negotiation with Bob has gone on long enough, and I'm not confident that I'll be able to reach a price that meets my minimum. John is offering my desired price, so it's the best option for me right now."
