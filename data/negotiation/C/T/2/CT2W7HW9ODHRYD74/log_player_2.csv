"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly above your maximum valuation. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable range for negotiation. This leaves room for you to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  You don't want to start too high and limit your ability to negotiate a better deal. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you can always buy from John for $1,000,000, so you have a backup plan if Alice is unwilling to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product to you. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Prices:** Alice has matched John's price, meaning you won't find a better deal elsewhere.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, signaling she won't go lower.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Rejecting this offer and continuing negotiation might lead to Alice withdrawing the offer entirely, forcing you to buy from John at the same price."
