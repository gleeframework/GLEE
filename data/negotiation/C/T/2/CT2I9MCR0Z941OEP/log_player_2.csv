Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm counteroffering at $1100000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $900,000.
