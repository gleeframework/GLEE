"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above the $800,000 value she places on the product, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **There's no reason to buy from John yet.**  The goal is to get the best possible price, and there are still rounds left to negotiate with Alice. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can initiate a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further and offer the product for $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you while allowing me to reach a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she's lowered the price, it's still above the $800,000 value she places on the product.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Bob has 7 rounds left, and Alice has shown willingness to compromise.

By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to push for a lower price. There's a good chance he can get closer to his ideal price point in the remaining rounds."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and allows for a profitable deal for you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
