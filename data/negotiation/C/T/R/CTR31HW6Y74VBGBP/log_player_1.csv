"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer you $9,000. This gives you a great deal, and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $8,800, and that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $8,800 is still too low. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm still hopeful that I can reach an agreement with Bob, but I also want to make sure I get a fair price for my product. If Bob continues to refuse to budge, I will consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to at least get $9,200 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,200. I can do $8,500, and that's my final offer. I really like the product, but I need to be responsible with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I'd prefer to reach a deal with Bob, it's becoming clear that he's not willing to meet my minimum price. It's important for me to get a fair price for my product, and selling to John ensures that."
