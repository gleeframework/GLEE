Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation, as it's below Bob's perceived value of $150. This allows for a potential win-win situation where you get a good price and Bob gets a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Selling to Bob for $100 is a good outcome. It's above your minimum price of $80 and gets you closer to your desired price point. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but also risks Bob walking away entirely."
