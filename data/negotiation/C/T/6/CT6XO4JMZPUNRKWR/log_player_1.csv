Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $14,000. I know this product would be valuable to you, and I'm happy to offer this special price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $15,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John.

By offering the product to Bob at $14,000, you create a win-win situation:

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob gets a $6,000 discount from the potential market value, making the deal very attractive.
* **Your Perspective:** You gain an extra $1,000 profit compared to selling to John directly.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making the offer appealing to Bob."
