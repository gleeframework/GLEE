"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to benefit from its value. I am offering it to you today for $110. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While $110 is less than your maximum, you can likely negotiate a better price. 
* **You have 10 rounds.**  This gives you plenty of time to try and get a lower price. 
* **John's offer is your safety net.** If negotiations with Alice fall apart, you have a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  This initial counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, signaling your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair offer:**  $105 is still above Alice's value of $100, making it a potential win-win scenario.
* **Room for negotiation:**  You still have 8 rounds left, leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $107.50. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Let me know if this offer suits you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target.** You're aiming for a price closer to $105.
* **There's still room to negotiate.** You have 7 rounds left, which allows for further bargaining.
* **John's offer is still your fallback.** You can always buy from him if negotiations with Alice fail.

By rejecting this offer, you can continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm willing to pay $106. This offer is closer to my initial proposal and allows us to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 106} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** This counteroffer is only $1.50 lower than Alice's offer, demonstrating a genuine attempt to meet halfway.
* **Closer to your target:** This offer brings you closer to your goal of $105 without being too aggressive.
* **Maintain momentum:** By continuing to counteroffer, you demonstrate your commitment to negotiating a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest in our product, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. Considering your latest offer, I propose to sell the product to you for $106.50. This is a slight increase from your last offer but still below the original asking price. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both parties. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your acceptable range.**  $106.50 is close to your target price of $105 and still a significant discount from your initial maximum of $120.
* **You've reached a compromise.** The negotiation has been back and forth, and Alice has shown flexibility. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While you could try to push for $106, you risk Alice rejecting your offer and possibly asking for a higher price. You also have fewer rounds left.
* **John's offer is still a backup.** If you feel strongly about $106, you can still go to John, but this is a decent deal. 

It's a good idea to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
