"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. I believe this price reflects the quality and benefits of the product while allowing us both to benefit from the transaction.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. While I see the value in your product, $95 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose a price of $90 for the product. This price still allows me to feel fairly compensated for the value I place on it, while remaining competitive. I hope this meets within your budget considerations. Looking forward to your feedback.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $90 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $87.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you.",87.5,Bob,4,
