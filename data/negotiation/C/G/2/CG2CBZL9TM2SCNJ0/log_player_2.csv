Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make another adjustment to the price. I can offer you $85, which is my lowest price for now. It's a good compromise between our previous offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $80, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John for $80 ensures you get the product at your target price."
