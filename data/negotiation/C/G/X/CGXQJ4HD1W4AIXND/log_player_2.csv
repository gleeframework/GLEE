"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price.** You are willing to pay $120 at most.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.** 
* **Buying from John is a viable option, but it's your last resort.** It's better to try negotiating with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's $5 less than Alice's initial price. 
* This shows that I'm serious about negotiating, but it's still a reasonable price that Alice might consider.
* I have 9 rounds left, so I have room to adjust my offer if necessary."
