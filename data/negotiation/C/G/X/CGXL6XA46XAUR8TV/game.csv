"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value I see in the product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a good investment.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is my absolute maximum. I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price, as it's fair for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
