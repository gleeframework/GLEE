"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145.  I think it's a great deal for you, given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's Offer:** $145 is too high. Bob can likely get a better deal.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Bob can start by offering a price closer to Alice's value of $120. This increases the likelihood of a deal within the 10 rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $130.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to $140. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Still saving as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $135 is still higher than Bob's ideal price. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob can continue to negotiate down.  Since Alice is willing to come down, there's room for further negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still hoping for something closer to $130. How about we split the difference at $132.50?"", ""product_price"": 132.50}
