"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm also emphasizing the value the product will bring to Bob, hopefully encouraging him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring you. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering at $95. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's last offer. Emphasizing the value to Bob and aiming for a close in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $92.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have liked to get closer to my initial target, $92 is a good price considering the value Bob places on the product. It's also better than selling to John, and with only 6 rounds left, it's likely I won't get a better offer."
