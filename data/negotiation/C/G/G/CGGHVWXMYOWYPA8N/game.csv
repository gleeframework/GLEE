"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, the price point you're suggesting is a bit high for me. Would you be open to considering $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting closer to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. That's my minimum target, and I'm not willing to compromise further. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
