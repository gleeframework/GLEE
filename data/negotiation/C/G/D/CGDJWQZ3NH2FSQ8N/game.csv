"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price given its value.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000, which is still a great value for this product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for continuing the discussion. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,000? This would still allow you a good profit and is within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500, which is still a good profit for me, but also a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price, and I believe we can close this deal.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
