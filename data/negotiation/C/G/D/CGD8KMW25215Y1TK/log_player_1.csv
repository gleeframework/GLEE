"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for my full value. If Bob rejects, I'll have to adjust, but I'm hoping to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to try and negotiate with Bob further before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but not by much. $9,500 is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping for a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to lower my price again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure.  If Bob rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John.  $9,000 is a compromise, but it's still a good deal for me considering my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations are getting too frustrating. Bob's offer isn't getting me anywhere near my minimum price, and I'm running out of rounds.  John is a guaranteed $10,000, which is a far better outcome than continuing this back and forth with Bob."
