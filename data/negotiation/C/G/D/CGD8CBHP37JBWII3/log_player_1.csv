{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  Bob is likely to counteroffer, and you can then assess whether to accept his offer or make a counteroffer of your own. Remember, you can always choose to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still worth trying to push for a higher price.  Bob is clearly interested, and it's worth seeing if you can get closer to your ideal price of $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $13,000 is just a bit below what I'm comfortable accepting at this time. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
