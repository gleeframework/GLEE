"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of the product ($12,000).  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $13,000 is just a bit below what I'm comfortable accepting at this time. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $13,500 is still less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **It's closer to Bob's desired price:** While Bob initially offered $13,000, Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a compromise. 
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely, especially since there's an alternative seller (John) available. 

By accepting the offer, Bob saves $1,500 compared to buying from John."
