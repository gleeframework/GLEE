,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob.  While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference at $87.50?  This way we both get a good deal and I can get this product sooner.",87.5,Bob,4,
