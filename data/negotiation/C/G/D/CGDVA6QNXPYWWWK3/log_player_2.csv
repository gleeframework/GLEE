"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $95. I believe it's worth every penny and will be valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can do better than $95.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still trying to save money, and $90 is still more than you'd like to spend. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference at $87.50?  This way we both get a good deal and I can get this product sooner."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
