"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a good deal for me. It's still significantly lower than what I'd pay John, and it's closer to my desired price point.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance Alice will stand firm, and I risk losing the opportunity altogether. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
