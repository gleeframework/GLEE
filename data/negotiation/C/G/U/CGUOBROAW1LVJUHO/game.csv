"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I understand your offer of $9000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your offer of $9800, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $11500.

What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $9500 again, but I'm willing to throw in a small concession - I'll also pay a small service fee of $200 to cover any additional costs. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle on the price and make this deal work.",9700.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your offer of $9700, and I appreciate the additional concession on the service fee. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made several compromises and concessions, but I'm still not willing to pay $12000. I'm willing to make one last offer - I'll pay $9000 for the product. If this is not acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away and consider buying from John for $8000.",9000.0,Bob,10,
