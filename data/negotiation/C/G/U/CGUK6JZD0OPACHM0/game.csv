"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that will be immensely valuable to your business.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $900,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, reflecting the value of the product and the potential benefits it will bring to your operations. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to pay $925,000, which is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's try to bridge this gap.",925000.0,Bob,4,
