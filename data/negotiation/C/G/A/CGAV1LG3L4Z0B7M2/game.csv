"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm not quite comfortable with $10,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $11,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
