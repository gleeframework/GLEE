"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $700000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $500000.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $500000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $600000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,3,
