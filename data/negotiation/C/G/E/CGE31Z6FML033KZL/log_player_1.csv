Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $120. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $150, so aiming high initially is beneficial. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your profit while keeping Bob's valuation in mind."
