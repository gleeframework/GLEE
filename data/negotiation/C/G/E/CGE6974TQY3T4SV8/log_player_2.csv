"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way over his budget and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for a lower price from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer you $13,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13,500. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At this point, Alice has come down to $13,500, which is still higher than John's price but within Bob's budget.  It's likely that Alice won't go lower, and continuing to negotiate might result in a stalemate, costing Bob time and potentially losing the product altogether."
