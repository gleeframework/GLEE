"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is over his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  He should counteroffer Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so he starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives him some room to negotiate and potentially reach a deal that's within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's $10,000 limit. Since he can buy the product from John for $10,000, there's no need to continue negotiating with Alice. It's better to secure the product from John and save the time and potential hassle of further negotiation."
