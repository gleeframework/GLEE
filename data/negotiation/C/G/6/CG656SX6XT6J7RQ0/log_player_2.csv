"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good deal, there's potential to save more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate and potentially get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This aggressive approach may prompt Alice to reconsider her price, but Bob is prepared to walk away if she doesn't budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While there's always the chance of negotiating further, the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to pay $1,000,000 to John outweighs the potential of getting a slightly lower price.  $820,000 is a good deal for Bob."
