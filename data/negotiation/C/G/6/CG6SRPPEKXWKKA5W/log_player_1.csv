"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Room for Compromise:** $17,000 leaves space for negotiation and potential compromise while still exceeding my minimum value. 
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I can counteroffer and adjust the price based on his response. 

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer. I'll need to observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting this offer would mean a significant financial loss for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's rejection is a setback, there is still room for negotiation. He has shown interest in the product and acknowledged its value. I can use this information to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control over the negotiation and can potentially push him closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum value, keeping in mind the potential risk of losing the deal entirely if Bob becomes too discouraged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Rationale:**  I'm countering with a price that is still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while ensuring I don't lose too much money.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to convince him that $14,000 is a fair price.
* **Seeking Agreement:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to find a solution that benefits both of us, promoting collaboration and a potential agreement.

**Important Note:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects again, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I am still interested in finding a solution within my budget. I am willing to pay $13,000 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it is still below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting would lead to a loss for me. 
* **Maintaining Control:**  By rejecting, I remain in control of the negotiation and can potentially push Bob closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum value, but I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer, likely closer to $14,000 to signal my willingness to compromise while also protecting my interests. I will also start considering the possibility of selling to John if Bob continues to be unwilling to meet my minimum price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $13,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still slightly lower than what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Compromise:** I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, showing willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price, trying to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and compromise.
* **Reaching Agreement Focus:** I'm emphasizing reaching an agreement, implying that this might be my final concession.

**Next Steps:** I will carefully monitor Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I might need to seriously consider selling to John. This is my final attempt to get closer to my desired price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to pay $13,200 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value. I hope this aligns better with your requirements. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $13,200 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiation with Bob risks a stalemate, as we're approaching a point where both parties might be unwilling to budge.
* **Guaranteed Value:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum value of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose money and securing a sure sale.

**Conclusion:** Given the limited rounds remaining and the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob, selling to John offers the most secure and profitable outcome."
