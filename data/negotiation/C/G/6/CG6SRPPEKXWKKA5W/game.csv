"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $13,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still slightly lower than what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",13500.0,Alice,5,
