"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than its value to you. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $12,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's significantly below the product's value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $12,000, so I'll offer $11,250. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,
