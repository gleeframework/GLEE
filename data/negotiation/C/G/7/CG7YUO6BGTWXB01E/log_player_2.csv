"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming for a 50% reduction. This is a bold move, but it's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate seriously.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup option with John, which gives me some negotiating leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. While it's a step down from her initial price, it's still outside my desired range. I want to continue negotiating and see if I can get the price closer to my budget.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup option with John, which gives me some negotiating leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still keeping the price below my budget.  This is a compromise, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. I believe this offer has a good chance of being accepted, but if not, I still have a backup option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay more than my initial offer, but $1,100,000 is still pushing it.  I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  I also have the option to buy from John as a safety net, which gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but only by a small amount. This demonstrates that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm not willing to overpay. I believe this offer is within Alice's range and could be accepted, especially since we are nearing the end of the negotiation and she has rejected previous offers. If she still rejects, I have a backup option with John, but I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm not ready to accept it yet.  I'm still confident that I can negotiate a lower price, especially since we are close to the end of the negotiation.  My backup option with John gives me the leverage to push for a better price. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making my final offer at my budget limit.  This is a significant compromise from my earlier offers, but it's also a clear indication of my willingness to close the deal. Alice has shown a willingness to lower her price, and I believe she will accept this final offer.  If not, I'll be forced to buy from John, but I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement at this point."
