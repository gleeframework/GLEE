"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $170.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but also considering Bob's value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly tone encourages Bob to consider the offer and potentially make a counteroffer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A counteroffer from Bob is likely, and this sets the stage for a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I'm confident that I can get a higher price than Bob's initial offer. 
* **John is a backup:** I'm comfortable continuing to negotiate with Bob knowing that I have a guaranteed sale with John at $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about $150? That's still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go right now.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** $150 is my absolute minimum, and I want to avoid selling to John if possible. 
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob that even $150 is a great deal for him, as he values the product at $120.
* **Staying firm:** This is my last chance to negotiate with Bob before resorting to selling to John. I'm making it clear that I'm not willing to budge further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $150 is still a little high for me.  How about $130?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John is a better option:** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, John offers a guaranteed $150.
* **Little room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer is only $10 higher than his initial offer, indicating he may not be willing to budge much further.

I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, but if he doesn't come up to my price, I'm ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $140.  This is my final offer, and it's still a good value for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his. This shows flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* **Final offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my last offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that $140 is still a good value, even if it's not his ideal price.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to accept. However, I'm still prepared to sell to John if necessary."
