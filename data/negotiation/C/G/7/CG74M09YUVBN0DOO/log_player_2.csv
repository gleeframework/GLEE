"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $170.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$170 is way too high for Bob, and he can get the same product from John for $120.  Rejecting the offer and moving to a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about $150? That's still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go right now.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still looking to save money. While $150 is better than $170, it's still higher than John's offer.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a better price for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $150 is still a little high for me.  How about $130?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $140.  This is my final offer, and it's still a good value for you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob has already made a counteroffer of $130, and Alice has countered with $140. While $140 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still comfortable with the $120 offer from John. 

There's a risk that Alice might accept Bob's next counteroffer, but there's also a chance that she will reject it. Since Bob is comfortable with John's offer, it's better to lock in the deal with John and avoid further negotiation."
