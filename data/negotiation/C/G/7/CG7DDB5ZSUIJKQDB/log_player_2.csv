Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $8,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum of $12,000. I'll give you a final offer of $11,500. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

```

Explanation:

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge below $8,750.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Alice. You maximize your savings by going with John."
