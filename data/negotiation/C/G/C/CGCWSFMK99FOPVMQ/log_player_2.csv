"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's much better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's no point in accepting her offer, and buying from John is a better option than accepting Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a fairly low counteroffer of $8,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the realm of what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping to get Alice to come down in price, but I'm also willing to walk away and buy from John if she's unwilling to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. It's better to continue negotiating, as John is still a viable option if we can't reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want to save as much money as possible.  It's a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer. I'm hoping to get a deal close to my maximum budget without pushing her away completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still above my budget, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. It's worth exploring if she'll come down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $9,500. This is closer to Alice's latest offer but still below my maximum budget.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and strike a deal before running out of rounds."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget.  Since there are only a few rounds remaining, I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal before I have to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

**Explanation:**

This is my final offer.  It's my maximum budget, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it. If she doesn't, I'll buy from John, as I'm running out of time."
