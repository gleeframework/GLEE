Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Starting with a significantly higher offer allows for negotiation and the potential to secure a much higher profit margin than selling to John. 
* **Risk Assessment:** While a high offer might lead to rejection, you have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $12,000. 
* **Anchoring:**  A high initial offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value, making him more receptive to a final price that's still above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can gradually lower your asking price, but always keep your $12,000 minimum in mind."
