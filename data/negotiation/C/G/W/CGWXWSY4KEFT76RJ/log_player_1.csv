Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $100 and my previous offer of $110. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's still not high enough. I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob in future rounds.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  This ensures I get my minimum price and allows me to close the deal quickly."
