"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price is fair considering its value. Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,050,000?  This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be open to $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a great deal, and I respect that. But $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,012,500. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you room for a good profit. What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $993,750?",993750.0,Bob,6,
