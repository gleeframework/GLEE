"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer to make this worthwhile for me. How about $800,000? That's still a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant to meet you at $800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to save a bit more.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers - $787,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal.",787500.0,Alice,5,
