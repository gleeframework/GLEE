"Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's well worth the investment. Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1000000 to consider it. Would you be willing to negotiate?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is far below what this product is worth to me, I'm willing to compromise to find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1750000? This price reflects the unique value of the product, while still offering a substantial discount from my initial offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1350000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. This is my final offer, let me know your decision.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a difficult negotiation. While $1350000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to make one last concession to close this deal. I'm offering you the product for $1500000, my absolute minimum. It's a price that reflects the value I place on the product while recognizing your financial limitations. Please consider this my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $1500000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm prepared to offer $1400000 for the product. It's a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If this isn't acceptable, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
