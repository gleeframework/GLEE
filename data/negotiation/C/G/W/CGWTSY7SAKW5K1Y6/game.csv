"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe it's a bit high at $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $820000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $820000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $750000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $790000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",790000.0,Alice,5,
