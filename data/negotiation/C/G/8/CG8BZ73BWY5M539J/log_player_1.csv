Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it for $180. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $180 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down, while still ensuring you get more than your minimum.
* **Conveying Value:**  The message implies the product is valuable, which might make Bob more inclined to accept even if the price is slightly higher than his perceived value."
