Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  This price point suggests you understand the product's worth but aren't being overly aggressive, increasing the chance Bob will accept.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob."
