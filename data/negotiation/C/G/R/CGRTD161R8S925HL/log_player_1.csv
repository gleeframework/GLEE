I'm starting with a high offer, knowing the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm hoping he values the product even higher, allowing me to make a good profit. If he doesn't, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to $1,500,000."

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my desired value."
