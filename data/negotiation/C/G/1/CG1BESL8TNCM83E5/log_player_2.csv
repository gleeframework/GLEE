"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $9,500. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own this valuable item, and I think you'll really appreciate its features. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John's offer of $10,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy."
