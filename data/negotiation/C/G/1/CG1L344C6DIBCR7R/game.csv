"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $13,750. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,750 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,125?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",13125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to find a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,125. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
