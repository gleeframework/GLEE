Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob but also maximizes your profit.  Offering a price closer to $1,200,000 might get you the most money, but there's a higher chance Bob could reject it.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the product's value and Bob's exclusivity.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 allows Bob to still gain $50,000 in perceived value while you secure a significant profit of $150,000.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is your only other option) creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer.  You could adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
