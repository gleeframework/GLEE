"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1000000 to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential gains. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1075000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the potential gains I could make. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1075000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to pay $1025000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and the potential gains you'd receive. Let's make a deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1025000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not ready to let go of the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $1060000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and the potential gains I could make. What do you think?",1060000.0,Alice,5,
