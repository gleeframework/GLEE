"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, and I still get a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I also want to test the waters and see how interested Bob truly is in buying the product at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal.  By rejecting, I can continue negotiating with Bob and try to reach a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for the minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still gives me a good profit margin. It also shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, while still maintaining a price that's above my minimum. I hope to find a middle ground between our two offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I think I can still get a better deal. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for the minimum price, and I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000.  This is a smaller drop than my previous counteroffer, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about finding a middle ground. We're now only $50,000 apart, and I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me halfway in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate.  Bob is unwilling to go higher than $1,200,000 and I'm not ready to accept that price yet. With only 4 rounds remaining, I don't have time to continue this negotiation.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
