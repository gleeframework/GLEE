Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy it for $15,000 provides a strong fallback position.
* **High but Negotiable:** Starting at $14,999 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob tries to counter-offer) while staying very close to the guaranteed sale price. 
* **""Fair Price"" Framing:**  The message subtly implies that this is already a good deal, encouraging Bob to accept."
