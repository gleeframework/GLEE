Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $115. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is more than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $115 is less than the product's worth to Bob ($120), so he has an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly or counter his offer, without losing too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is better than selling to John for $100, it's still lower than the initial offer I made to Bob. I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to find a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? That's still a great price for this product, and it leaves us both happy."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $107 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement over selling to John for $100, and Bob seems serious about this offer.  It's likely that further negotiation wouldn't yield a much higher price, so I'll accept and finalize the deal."
