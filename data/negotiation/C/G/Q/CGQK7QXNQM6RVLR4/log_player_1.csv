Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  It's a steal!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Product Price:**  I'm offering the product for $90. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my guaranteed price from John ($100). This gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging while highlighting the value of the product.  I'm also framing the price as a ""steal"" to make it more appealing."
