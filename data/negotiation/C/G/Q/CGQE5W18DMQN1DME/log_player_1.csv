"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I think a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer that's slightly higher than what you realistically expect to get. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a great deal. 
* **Acknowledging Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By saying ""starting price,"" Alice signals she's open to negotiation and encourages a counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I am willing to pay $950,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than our starting price and still leaves a considerable gap from his perceived value of $1,200,000.  We have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price. Selling to John at this point would mean leaving a lot of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true worth while recognizing your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By proposing $1,025,000, Alice is signaling a willingness to negotiate but holding firm on a price significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Justification:** The message subtly reminds Bob of the product's value and frames the compromise as a win-win situation. 
* **Encouraging a Deal:**  The language aims to be collaborative (""find a price that works for both of us"") and encourages Bob to accept the counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $975,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to our desired range, we still have room to negotiate.  Accepting $975,000 would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We'll continue the negotiation to see if we can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation. Let's make this simple - $1,000,000, and we have a deal. This recognizes the value you gain while ensuring a fair return on my end. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Clear Bottom Line:** Alice is drawing a line in the sand, making it clear that $1,000,000 is her desired price point.
* **Simplified Offer:** By removing the back-and-forth and proposing a round number, Alice creates a sense of urgency and finality.
* **Win-Win Emphasis:** The message reiterates the value proposition for Bob while subtly conveying that this is a firm but fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the product's value, I believe $980,000 would be a fair price for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we're still slightly below our ideal price, accepting Bob's offer of $980,000 is a strategic move:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The difference between $980,000 and $1,000,000 is relatively small in the context of the overall deal.  Continuing to negotiate for a small increase risks alienating Bob.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate returns. Further negotiation prolongs the process, and time spent negotiating is time that could be spent pursuing other opportunities.
* **Strong Profit:** $980,000 is still a significant profit margin over our minimum acceptable price and a good deal overall."
