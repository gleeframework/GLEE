Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate above John's offer of $1,000,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strong but Polite Language:** The message aims to be persuasive by highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""value and potential"" without being overly aggressive."
