"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $14,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
