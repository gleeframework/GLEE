Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could net you a quicker sale and still a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 is a compelling price point. It's considerably less than your minimum but still offers you a $150,000 profit over Bob's perceived value.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""one-time offer"" are designed to encourage Bob to act quickly and prevent him from lowballing you.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with a small risk (Bob rejecting the offer) for the potential of a higher return."
