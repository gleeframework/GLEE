"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's important to signal that we're not willing to pay anywhere near that amount.  We'll counter with a much lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** We're starting with a low anchor price ($6,000) to shift the negotiation in our favor. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it shows we're serious buyers but not willing to be pushed around.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message maintains a friendly tone while clearly stating our budget limitations. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer gives us plenty of space to gradually increase our offer over the remaining rounds while still staying well below our $8,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be a bit flexible, how about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down slightly, but she's still holding firm to a price that's above our budget. We need to show her we're willing to walk away if the price isn't right. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about our budget constraints. Let's see if we can bring her down further in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $7,000. That's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  We're raising our offer to $7,000, signaling that we're willing to move towards her price, but not drastically. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""market value,"" we're subtly implying we've done our research and know there are alternatives.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  We're still below our $8,000 limit, leaving room for one more potential increase if needed, but also making it clear we have a firm walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about this. $7,000 is simply too low for what this product offers.  If I were to let it go for $9,000, that would be the absolute lowest I could go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but we're still $1,000 away from our backup plan with John.  There's no need to rush into anything. We'll reject this offer to see if we can push her just a bit further down.  We're getting into the later rounds, so Alice might be more willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close! I can tell this product means a lot to you, and I respect that. How about we split the difference and call it $8,500?  That's a firm offer from my side."",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:** We're starting to signal that this is our final offer by using phrases like ""firm offer."" This creates some urgency for Alice. 
* **Strategic Compromise:**  While $8,500 is slightly above our ideal price, it shows Alice we're willing to compromise. 
* **Splitting the Difference Tactic:** By suggesting a split, it seems like a fair and logical solution, potentially making it more appealing for Alice to accept. 
* **Backup Plan in Mind:** We're still above our $8,000 limit with John, but this offer gives us a little wiggle room to potentially negotiate further or accept if Alice completely refuses to budge."
