I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum price of $10,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe it's attractive enough for Bob to consider, knowing he values it at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $12,000. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,500.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum. While I would prefer to get a better price, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a decent profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
