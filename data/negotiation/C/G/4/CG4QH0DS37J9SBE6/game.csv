"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of that, I would like to adjust my offer slightly. I propose a price of $1100000 for the product, which still includes the special package of additional services valued at $50000. This would allow us to meet somewhere in the middle and ensure both parties are satisfied. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $1075000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal. I'm confident that this price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've considered your latest offer and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To further accommodate your budget while maintaining a fair profit margin, I propose a price of $1085000 for the product. This offer includes the same special package of additional services valued at $50000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions.",1085000.0,Alice,5,
