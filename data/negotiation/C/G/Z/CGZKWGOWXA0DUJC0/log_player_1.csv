Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price gives me some wiggle room to potentially lower the price if Bob is hesitant. 
* **Not too high:** It's also important to note that $115 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, which ensures that I'm still earning a profit. 
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

This approach strikes a balance between maximizing my potential earnings and keeping the negotiation open to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Opportunity to counter:**  While Bob is willing to pay something,  I can still try to negotiate a better price.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  I have a guaranteed alternative with John, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's low offer.

I'll counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 but still potentially appealing to Bob.
* **Balancing profit and possibility:** $110 is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's offer while leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone and expressing a willingness to reach a deal.

This counteroffer keeps me in the negotiation, potentially allowing me to secure a better price than Bob's initial offer while still potentially closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $100 is a fair price. Can you meet me at $105? That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I've already made concessions. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further concessions and a lower final price.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring a profitable transaction.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, the risk of further negotiation and the guaranteed profit with John make it the wiser choice at this point."
