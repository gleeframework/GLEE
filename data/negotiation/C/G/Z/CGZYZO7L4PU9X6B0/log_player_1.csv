"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $120 to me, so I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept anything below my minimum price of $120. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $125?  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. Can you meet me halfway again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm starting to consider selling to John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is still too low for me.  I'm really hoping to get at least $120 for this product, and I'm willing to do $122.  It's a small difference, and I think it's fair considering how much I'm already coming down."", ""product_price"": 122}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable paying $122. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $119. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $119
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've made several concessions, but Bob's offer is still too low. At this point, it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'll accept John's offer and sell the product for $120."
