"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired price range. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,500. Would you be willing to come down to that?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $13250? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than the $14,000 she initially offered and is well within Bob's budget of $15,000. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or losing the deal entirely."
