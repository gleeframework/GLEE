"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $800,000. This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the need for a more realistic price point.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower my price to $2,000,000.  This offer reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal while ensuring the product's worth is recognized.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000. This demonstrates my serious interest and willingness to move closer to your asking price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. However,  $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm counteroffering $1,200,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and should demonstrate my strong interest in acquiring the product.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
