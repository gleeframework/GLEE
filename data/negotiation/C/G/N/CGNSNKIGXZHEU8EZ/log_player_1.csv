**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price of $1,500,000. He's consistently been below that threshold, and while he's incrementally increasing his offers, the pace suggests it'll be difficult to bridge the gap in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without further risk of negotiation."
