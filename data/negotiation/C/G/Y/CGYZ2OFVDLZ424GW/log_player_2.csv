Should you require any further information or have questions about the product, please do not hesitate to reach out. I look forward to the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John at $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's first offer, you might prompt her to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
