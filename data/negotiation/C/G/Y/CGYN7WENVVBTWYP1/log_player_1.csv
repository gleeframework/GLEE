"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'll keep an eye on the number of rounds and my fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I don't want to risk losing too many rounds, $10,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'll counter with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum, and hopefully, it's closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$12,000 is still too low, and I'm not sure if I have enough rounds to get closer to my target price with Bob. I'm going to counteroffer again, but if he rejects again, I might consider selling to John to avoid losing more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to drop my price again to $16,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum.  We're getting close to the middle ground, and I think this might be more appealing to Bob.  If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
