"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $10000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price considering its worth to you.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $9500 for the product. This price still reflects its value to me, but I'm showing my flexibility to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9500 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  How about $9000?  This represents a fair compromise, and allows both of us to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to meet you at $9200. This is as low as I can go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to ensure a fair price. I'm willing to go up to $9100 for the product. This represents a significant move on my part and reflects the value I see in your product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9100, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to consider a price of $9500 is too low, but I can do $9300. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your commitment to reaching an agreement. I'm willing to go up to $9200 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. I hope we can finalize this deal now.",9200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $9300, but I'm willing to throw in a small concession. I'll meet you at $9250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,9,
