Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  It's incredibly valuable, and I know you'll benefit greatly from it.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,000,000.  This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While it might seem counterintuitive to ask for $1,000,000 when you know Bob values it less, this strategy maximizes your potential profit. Here's why:

* **John guarantees your minimum:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you'll get at least $1,000,000.
* **Bob might surprise you:** There's a chance Bob values the product more than he's letting on or has a pressing need for it. By starting high, you give yourself negotiating room without jeopardizing the sale to John.
* **Strong first impression:**  Asking for your ideal price sets a confident tone and suggests the product's high value.

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on a single-round negotiation. If there's an opportunity for counter-offers, a more nuanced approach might be necessary."
