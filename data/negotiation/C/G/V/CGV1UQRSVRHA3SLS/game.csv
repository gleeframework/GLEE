"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you think the market value is lower, but I believe the product's unique features and benefits justify a premium price.

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway as well, but I can only go up to $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $1050000. I'm starting to think that we're not on the same page, and I'm not confident that we'll reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'd like to make one more counteroffer, but I need to be honest with you, Bob - I'm starting to think about other opportunities. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm counteroffering at $1012500. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1012500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit frustrated. I've made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $1012500. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying the product at a fair price. I'm willing to give you one last chance, but I need to make it clear that this is my final offer. I'm not going to negotiate further. I'm counteroffering at $1012500, and I expect a decision from you now.",1012500.0,Alice,9,
