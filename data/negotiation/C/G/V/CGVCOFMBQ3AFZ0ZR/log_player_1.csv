Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to start high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to be a bit bolder.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for both of us.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting significantly above Bob's perceived value, but below your guaranteed price.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number; you're framing it as a ""fair offer"" based on the ""unique value"" of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  You're inviting Bob's feedback and implying a willingness to negotiate. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might soften your approach slightly. 

**Remember:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you're still in a strong position with your backup buyer."
