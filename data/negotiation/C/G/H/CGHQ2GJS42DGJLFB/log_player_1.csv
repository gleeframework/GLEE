"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I still have time and I can get a better deal if I negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  $8,800 is still too far below my minimum price of $12,000. I have more rounds left and I'm not giving up yet. I'm confident that I can get a better price or at least get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $9,200 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $9,200. This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,900 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a price that meets my minimum. It's only round 6, and I have time to get my desired price from John.  It's better to secure the $12,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
