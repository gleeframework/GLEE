Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $77. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $70. I think the product is worth a bit more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $75. It's a good compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $75, and it's a reasonable price compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and avoid potentially losing the deal."
