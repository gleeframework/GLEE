Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 allows for potential negotiation downwards while still remaining comfortably above Alice's minimum price. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair reflection of worth"" to justify the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This strategy assumes Bob is open to negotiation. If Alice knows Bob is particularly tough, she might slightly lower the initial price.
* **Relationship Building:**  Even though Alice has a backup buyer, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob might be beneficial for future opportunities. The tone of the message aims to be collaborative rather than confrontational."
