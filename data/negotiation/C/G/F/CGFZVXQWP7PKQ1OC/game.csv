"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking $130 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of offering $100 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, appreciate the offer. $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm willing to negotiate a bit more to make this work.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to meet in the middle, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,4,
