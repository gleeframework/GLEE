"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm proposing a price of $600,000 for the product. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $600,000 is a bit high for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle? ",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we try $550,000?",550000.0,Alice,3,
