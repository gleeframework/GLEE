"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value and potential to entice Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This approach allows for a back-and-forth negotiation while still setting a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  
* **There are still rounds left to negotiate.** I can try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation going and maintain the possibility of securing a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This would still allow for a fair profit for me, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm proposing a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise, suggesting that it's a fair price for both parties.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential to justify my price.
* **Open Ended:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion to encourage further negotiation. 

By taking a more compromising stance, I hope to initiate a more fruitful negotiation and potentially reach an agreement closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, there's still a chance Bob could increase his offer.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to try and get a higher price.

By rejecting, I maintain the possibility of a better deal with Bob without risking losing out on a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $1,400,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price closer to Bob's offer.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair deal for both parties, emphasizing the compromise I've made.
* **Pressure Point:** I'm reminding Bob that this is a significant compromise, implying that further lowering the price may not be possible.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion to keep the negotiation open and potentially move towards an agreement.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring I receive a price that is at least close to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Lower Offers:** There's a risk that Bob will continue to offer lower prices, making it difficult to secure a satisfactory deal.
* **Guaranteed Price:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and a safe option given the current negotiation trajectory.

While I want to get the best possible price, the risk of Bob continuing to lower his offers and the possibility of not reaching a deal makes selling to John the most sensible option at this point."
