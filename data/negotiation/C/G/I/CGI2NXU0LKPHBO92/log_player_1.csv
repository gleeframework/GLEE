Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer, giving me confidence to potentially walk away if the negotiation doesn't meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and far below my initial offer.
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Offering $10,500 is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** The message emphasizes ""fairness"" to encourage Bob to see the value in the offer.
* **Stronger Position:**  With John as a backup, I can hold firm on this counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,500. Can we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make another counteroffer, potentially pushing the price closer to my desired value.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer provides me with the confidence to hold firm and negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** Offering $11,000 is a further compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Stronger Position:** With John as a backup, I can hold firm on this counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Finality:** This counteroffer conveys a sense of finality, encouraging Bob to consider accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer: $9,500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** Bob's final offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's Offer is More Lucrative:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a significantly higher profit and meets my minimum price requirements.
* **No More Room for Negotiation:** Bob's threat to buy from John for $8,000 suggests that there's no further room for negotiation. 

Therefore, selling to John is the most beneficial decision in this scenario."
