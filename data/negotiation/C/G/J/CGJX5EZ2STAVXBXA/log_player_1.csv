I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is my maximum budget. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
