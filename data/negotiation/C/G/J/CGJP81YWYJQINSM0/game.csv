"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our respective positions. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to stick to your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.
