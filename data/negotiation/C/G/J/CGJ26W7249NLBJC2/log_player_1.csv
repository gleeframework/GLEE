"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, but also shows Bob that I value the product highly. It's important to start strong, but also be prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,800,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a higher return. I want to see if Bob is willing to go up further before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
``` 
I'm countering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping for a higher price than $1,700,000. I'll counter again and see if Bob will budge further.  We are nearing the middle ground of our initial offers, so we'll need to be careful not to get too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,850,000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a good price.  I'm hoping Bob will see that we're getting close to an agreement and will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,600,000 is close to John's offer, I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal with Bob. I'm running out of time, but I think there's still room for Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm going to take a more aggressive approach. I'm offering $1,650,000, hoping to push Bob closer to accepting a price that is still higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it's disappointing to settle for $1,550,000, it's still a better deal than selling to John for $1,500,000. With only two rounds left, there's a high chance Bob will reject my counteroffer, and I'll be forced to sell to John. It's better to secure the deal with Bob now, even if it's only a slightly better price."
