"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $7000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we try $9000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8500. I'd like to stick with my previous offer of $8500. I'm getting a bit concerned that if we don't meet at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",8500.0,Bob,6,
