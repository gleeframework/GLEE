"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, and you should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering $9,500, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above the product's worth to her.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This offer shows a willingness to negotiate while also establishing a lower price point. It leaves room for Alice to counter with a higher price, but hopefully, she'll recognize that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price.** While $10,500 is better than $12,000, it's still not a good deal.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** I believe I can still get a lower price from Alice.
* **I'm not desperate:** I have the option to buy from John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $10,000 is a compromise between Alice's latest offer ($10,500) and my previous offer ($9,500).
* **Showing willingness to meet halfway:** This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good price. 
* **Staying within my budget:** $10,000 is still significantly cheaper than buying from John, making this a better deal for me."
