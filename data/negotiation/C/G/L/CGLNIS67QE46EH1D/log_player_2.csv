"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $120 from John, so there's no reason to pay $150."
