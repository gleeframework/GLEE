"Alice, $25000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $15000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $15000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $20000? This would allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's still a good value for you considering the potential benefits of this product.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $20000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $18000. This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to reach a mutually agreeable price.",18000.0,Bob,4,
