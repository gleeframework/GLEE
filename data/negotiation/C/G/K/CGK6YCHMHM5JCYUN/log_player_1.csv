{""message"": ""Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $25,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 25000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $25,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **No specific details:** I'm keeping the message brief and avoid mentioning any specific details about the product. This is to avoid revealing too much information about its value to Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my initial offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $25000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $15000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price. While I could accept it and secure a sale, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum. I believe there's still potential to earn a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:** I'm confident that the product is worth more than $15,000 to Bob, given his initial interest. 
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially get a price closer to my initial asking price.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price somewhere between $15,000 and my initial asking price of $25,000. I'll consider factors like Bob's budget and his level of interest when determining my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $15,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $20,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's still a good value for you considering the potential benefits of this product."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price in the middle of my initial asking price and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the potential benefits of the product to justify the price.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $20,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, allowing me to make a profit. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer, lower my price further, or sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $20000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $18000. This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $18,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm confident that I can still make a decent profit at this price, and it's likely that further negotiation will be time-consuming and unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on, potentially leading to John's offer becoming more attractive.
* **Near my minimum:** $18,000 is only $3,000 below my initial asking price, which is a significant gain compared to selling to John. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  Establishing a good relationship with Bob could lead to future sales opportunities.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the transaction with Bob and move on to other business opportunities."
