Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $15,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,""  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth, justifying the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?""  invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.
* **Backup Plan:**  It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. This knowledge gives me confidence in my negotiation with Bob."
