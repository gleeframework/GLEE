"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I accept $11,250?  This way, we both get a fair deal.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $11,250 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. Let's try to close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $11,000 for this to work.  If you're serious about this deal, let's see if we can find a compromise at $11,000.  ",11000.0,Alice,5,
