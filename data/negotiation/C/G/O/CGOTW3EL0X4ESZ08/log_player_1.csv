Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and higher than Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to build a positive rapport with Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard line, giving Bob the opportunity to counteroffer and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $100 ensures I have a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $90 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While $100 is my fallback with John, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's interest and frame the offer as a potential solution.
* **Focus on Reaching an Agreement:** My message emphasizes the desire to reach a mutual agreement, encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While I could counteroffer again, there's a risk Bob will continue to lower his offer or simply walk away.
* **Guaranteed $100 with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob. 

It's a tough decision, but considering the guaranteed outcome with John and the potential for Bob to continue lowering his offer, selling to John is the most pragmatic choice at this point."
