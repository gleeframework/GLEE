Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is closer to his target, he can likely get a lower price with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  How about $8,750?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. After reviewing our costs and the value you place on the product, I propose a final price of $8,900. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's quality while remaining within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $8,750. It's a good deal for Bob, considering his goal of saving as much money as possible.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, especially with John's offer of $10,000 looming.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice to secure the product at a reasonable price."
