"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it while staying within my financial limitations. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value lies above $1,000,000. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,100,000. This price still reflects the product's true value while being more in line with your budget.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford at this time.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget constraints. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's value while still being within your budget constraints.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
