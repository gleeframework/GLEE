"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. I think this is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer, as it's still above your maximum price point of $120. You can likely get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
