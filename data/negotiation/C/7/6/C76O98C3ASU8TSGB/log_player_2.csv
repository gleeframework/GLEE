"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000.  This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is better than buying from John for $1,000,000. Even though it's more than Alice's valuation, it's still a good deal for Bob."
