"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value is higher for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer.  The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, meaning there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $13,500? It's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13,500 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. Let's split the difference. How about $13,750?  This would give us both a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,750 is a good compromise. It's still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's $15,000 price.  While Bob could try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to pay John's higher price.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing out altogether."
