Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves space for negotiation while ensuring I'm well above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Polite and Professional Tone:** The message aims to establish a positive and collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is better than our fallback option (selling to John for $1,200,000). However, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, we signal that we believe the product is worth more and encourage him to increase his bid. We'll aim for a counteroffer that keeps us closer to our initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. Would you consider $1,380,000?"",
""product_price"": 1380000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($1,350,000) and my previous asking price ($1,400,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a higher number.
* **Maintaining Value Proposition:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of the benefits it offers. 
* **Direct and Concise:** The language is clear and to the point, aiming for a quick and efficient negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose an offer of $1,360,000. I hope this is within the range you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly higher than our guaranteed sale to John ($1,200,000) and continuing to negotiate for a smaller increase carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away entirely.  Accepting now secures a strong profit."
