"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. Based on my research and understanding of the market, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair and competitive price considering the product's unique value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet the price of $1,800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This seems to be a fair compromise between our positions.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
