"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is closer to my value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. By expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob, I aim to encourage him to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is close to my minimum price of $80, and it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potential risk of a counter-offer I may not be able to accept."
