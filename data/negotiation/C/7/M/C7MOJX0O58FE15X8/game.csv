"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least $12,000 to you and I'm hoping to get a good price for it. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value to you, and it gives me a decent profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference at $11,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally close this deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about we settle on $11,250? I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement today.",11250.0,Bob,6,
