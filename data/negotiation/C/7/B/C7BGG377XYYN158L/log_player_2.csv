"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is less than the product's worth to Alice, you know you can get it for $80 from John. Rejecting this offer sets you up for a better deal."
