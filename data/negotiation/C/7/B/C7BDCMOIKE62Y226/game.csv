"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $1200000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $1600000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1600000. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1400000. However, I'm still a bit concerned that we're getting close to the product's minimum value to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $1600000, but I'll throw in some extras, like a complimentary service package, to sweeten the deal?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extra perks, but I'm still not convinced that $1600000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to meet you at $1300000. I think that's a more reasonable price for the product, and I'm willing to consider the service package you're offering.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value. How about we meet at $1500000, which is my absolute minimum, and I'll throw in the service package I mentioned earlier, plus an additional warranty extension?",1500000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $1500000. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price, considering the extras you're offering.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1200000. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in an additional exclusive feature that's not included in the standard package. This feature alone is worth $200000, so I'm essentially giving you a $200000 discount on top of the extras I mentioned earlier. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional feature, but I'm still not willing to pay $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I think this is a fair price considering the extras and the exclusive feature you're offering. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $800000.",1000000.0,Bob,10,
