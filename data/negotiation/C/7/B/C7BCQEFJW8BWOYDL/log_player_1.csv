Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $150 and leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob is interested in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $100, which is significantly below my minimum price of $150.  I will counteroffer Bob to try and get closer to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer with $175. This is a compromise, as it's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $140 is still below my minimum price of $150. While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident I'll be able to get a higher price from Bob. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the best option to ensure I don't lose any money."
