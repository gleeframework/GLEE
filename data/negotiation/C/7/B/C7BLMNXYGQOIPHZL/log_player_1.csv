Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be able to get a ""deal"" if he pushes back.
* **Justification:** While I don't explicitly state why my price is higher than Bob's perceived value, I hint at the product's worth with ""Given its value..."". This opens the door for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reveal his own valuation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I subtly introduce the presence of John (""...before I list it publicly..."") to create a sense of urgency and competition, even though John's offer is my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** Ideally, Bob accepts the $15,000 offer.
2. **Open Negotiation:** If Bob counters, I can gauge his willingness to pay and adjust accordingly, knowing my fallback is John's $12,000 offer."
