"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to secure a better deal.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $925,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $912,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me and the effort I've put into acquiring it.
