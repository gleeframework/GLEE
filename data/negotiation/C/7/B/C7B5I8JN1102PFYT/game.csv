"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be workable for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  To be honest, I have another offer I'm considering. To make this work, I'd need to be at $980,000.  Let me know if that's something you can do.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you have another offer to consider, but I'm not willing to go as high as $980,000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer it to you for $1,015,000. This is still a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,7,
