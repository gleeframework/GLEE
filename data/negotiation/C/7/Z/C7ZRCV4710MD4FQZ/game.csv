"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more substantial discount. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing $1,050,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, considering my budget and the market value.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm proposing $1,075,000.  This reflects the unique features and benefits you'll gain from this product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, Alice, but $1,075,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
