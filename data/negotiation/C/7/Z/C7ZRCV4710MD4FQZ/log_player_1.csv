Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more substantial discount. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

Bob's offer is still too low, but I want to see if I can push him a bit further.  I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing $1,050,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, considering my budget and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's not yet in my desired range.  I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm proposing $1,075,000.  This reflects the unique features and benefits you'll gain from this product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price, Alice, but $1,075,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is refusing to budge on his price, and I'm running out of time.  It's clear that I won't be able to get a price I'm comfortable with from Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
