"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price. You might be able to get a better deal with Alice or, if that fails, you can always buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,150,000 is still over your maximum budget. You can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or go with John's offer, which is guaranteed at your maximum budget."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit out of reach. I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and it allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. My counteroffer is $1,080,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my minimum selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You've already made two counteroffers, and while it's possible Alice might come down further, there's no guarantee. It's now more efficient to take John's offer at $1,000,000. You'll save $80,000 compared to Alice's latest offer, and you'll avoid potentially going back and forth with Alice for several more rounds."
