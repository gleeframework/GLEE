{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I've also tried to be friendly and engaging to build a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $135. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I don't see much room for further negotiation.  It's better to sell to John and get my minimum price rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
