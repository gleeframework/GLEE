# Alice's message: I have a great product for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very competitive price. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You can do better than $100.  Since you value the product at $120 and Alice at $80, there is room to negotiate."

You can still get a better price than $105. Continue negotiating with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it.

You are still better off negotiating with Alice than buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's more advantageous to accept Alice's offer of $105.  You've already negotiated a significant discount from her original price and are still getting the product for less than John's price. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
