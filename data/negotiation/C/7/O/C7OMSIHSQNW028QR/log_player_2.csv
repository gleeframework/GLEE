"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is less than Bob's maximum price of $120, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price down as much as possible while still staying within his budget. Offering $95 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. This offer leaves room for compromise, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. $105 is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product without further negotiation and potentially risking a breakdown in the deal or having to buy from John at a higher price."
