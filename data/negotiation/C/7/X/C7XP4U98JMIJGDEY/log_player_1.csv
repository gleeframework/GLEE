Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer the product at $120 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below my minimum acceptable price ($120) creates a sense of urgency and makes it more appealing to Bob. He gets a perceived ""deal"" while I still make a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John provides me leverage.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, which allows me to confidently price higher."
