Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, leaving room for Bob to negotiate if he finds the price too steep.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to maximize profit by testing Bob's willingness to pay a premium. If Bob accepts, you earn significantly more. If he rejects the offer, you can always fall back on John's guaranteed purchase at your minimum acceptable price."
