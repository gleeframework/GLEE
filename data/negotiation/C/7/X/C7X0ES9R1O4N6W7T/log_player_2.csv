# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

While $11,000 is closer to my target price, I'll try pushing my luck a bit further. It's still a significant markup from Alice's value."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11,250. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Alice is clearly holding firm, and this price is close enough to my target to be worthwhile. It's better to secure the deal now at $11,250 than risk the negotiations stalling and ending up at John's $12,000 price."
