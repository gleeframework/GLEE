"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  $9,600 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,800. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to her is $12,000.  We'll see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and I think I can get a lower price than $9,200. I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm going to offer $9,000.  This is a compromise between her last offer and my previous counteroffer.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement this time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down in price, and I'm getting closer to my goal of saving money.  $9,100 is a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from her by continuing to negotiate."
