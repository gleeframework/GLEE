"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your Value:** The product is worth $120 to you.
* **Alice's Offer:** She's selling for $100.
* **John's Price:**  He's selling for $120.

Accepting Alice's offer means you save $20 compared to buying from John.  Even though you could get it for less (Alice's cost is $80), you're still getting a good deal."
