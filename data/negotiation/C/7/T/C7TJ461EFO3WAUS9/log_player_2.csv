"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $14,000. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within his budget, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the first offer allows him to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob wants to get the price down significantly, but not risk Alice walking away.  A $1,000 drop from Alice's initial offer is a good starting point.
* **Message:**  The message is polite but firm, acknowledging Alice's offer while stating Bob's position.
* **Counteroffer:**  The counteroffer is within Bob's budget, but low enough to show he's serious about negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I would like to offer the product to you for $13,500. This price reflects both the value of the product and your willingness to pay more than its face value. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and $13,500 is still within his budget.  
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will become less willing to compromise, potentially leading to a stalemate or a higher price later. 
* **Time Factor:**  The deal is close to being done.  Accepting the offer now avoids the risk of running out of rounds."
