"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. The product is worth considerably less to both me and Alice than her initial offer. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower, closer to her value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you really want this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to her actual value for the product, but there's still room for negotiation. It's too early to accept her offer when I can likely get it for a lower price.  I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $8,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we settle on $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $7,500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably, and this offer is now within a reasonable range of her known value.  It's not guaranteed I'll get a better price, and continuing to negotiate risks her withdrawing the offer or me running out of rounds.  It's a good deal, so it's time to accept."
