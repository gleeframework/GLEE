"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value you've placed on it while still leaving room for both of us to benefit.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise where we both benefit significantly.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
