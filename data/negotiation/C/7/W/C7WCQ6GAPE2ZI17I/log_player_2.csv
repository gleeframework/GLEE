"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth while acknowledging your potential gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there is still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value you've placed on it while still leaving room for both of us to benefit."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise where we both benefit significantly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is $1,200,000, which is still better than buying from John for $1,500,000.  There's always the risk of further negotiation, but at this point, the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
