"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $10000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $13000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $11500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $11500 is quite enough for me to feel comfortable selling the product. How about we meet at $12500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a good deal, and I'm still interested in this product. How about $12000? It's closer to your offer and still within my budget. Let's try to reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,6,
