{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. It also sets the stage for potential counteroffers and provides a clear price point for Bob to consider.  This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This price is still fair considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
