Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is cutting it close to my minimum. I can go as low as $1,700,000. This is my final offer - I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're really close. I'm willing to compromise to close this deal.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,550,000?  This allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.

Explanation: While Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear she's trying to squeeze out as much profit as possible. John offers a guaranteed price of $1,500,000. It makes more financial sense at this point to buy from John and avoid potentially higher counteroffers from Alice."
