"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of its value and leaves room for you to see a substantial return on your investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could do $1,250,000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is cutting it close to my minimum. I can go as low as $1,700,000. This is my final offer - I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close. I appreciate that this is your final offer, but I can't meet you at $1,700,000. My absolute best is $1,400,000.  Let me know if we have a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're really close. I'm willing to compromise to close this deal.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,550,000?  This allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
