{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to buy from Alice, as the price is likely to go up. It's better to reject and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 2500}
``` 

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down from her initial price.  I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also aware that I may need to increase my offer in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is still asking for a higher price than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to try to push her lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still staying below what I consider a fair price. I believe this shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I won't be taken advantage of."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and we're already halfway through the rounds. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing it by pushing for a lower price and potentially running out of rounds."
