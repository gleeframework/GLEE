Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 
 
I, as Alice, am starting with a higher price than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation or allows me to maximize my profit if Bob accepts the initial offer.  If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can always negotiate down or sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
