"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value and might encourage Bob to negotiate. It also leaves room for me to lower the price in subsequent rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,750. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is another compromise, closer to Bob's latest offer.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I believe I can secure a better price with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,250. We're getting close to a deal, and I'm hoping this counteroffer shows that I'm willing to be flexible but also that I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, there are only a few rounds left and I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired price with one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000 to close the deal with Bob. This is closer to his offer and still above my minimum.  If he rejects this, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  With only one round left, the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and me ending up with nothing is too high. I'll take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
