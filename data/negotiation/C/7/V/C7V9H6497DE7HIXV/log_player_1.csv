{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still being a good deal for me. I'm confident I can get at least $10,000 from Bob, so this is a good starting point.  If he rejects, I can always lower the price, but I want to see if he's willing to pay closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $10,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Okay, Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is a little too low for me.  How about $11,000?  That's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 11000}
