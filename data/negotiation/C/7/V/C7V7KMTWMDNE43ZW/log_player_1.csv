"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $13,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. While I want to find a fair deal, accepting such a low price would be a significant loss. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob's offer is understandable, but there's a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price point. 

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $11,500.  This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $11,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $7,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is still very low, but we're making some progress. It's time to decide if I want to hold out hope for Bob offering closer to $10,000, or take the guaranteed offer from John.
