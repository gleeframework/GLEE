"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping we can settle on a price that's a bit more comfortable for me. How about we consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as high as $975,000. I'm willing to make another adjustment and offer $1,025,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
