Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as high as $975,000. I'm willing to make another adjustment and offer $1,025,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate but is unlikely to move much below $1,025,000.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are getting smaller, and the risk of Alice walking away is increasing.  It's a good deal compared to John's offer."
