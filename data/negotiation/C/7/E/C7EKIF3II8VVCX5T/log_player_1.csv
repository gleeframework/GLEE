Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize your potential earnings from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is close to Bob's perceived value, it leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if he tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value specifically to Bob (""your expertise"") might make the price more palatable.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could offer a lower price. However, starting high gives you the best chance to get closer to Bob's maximum valuation."
