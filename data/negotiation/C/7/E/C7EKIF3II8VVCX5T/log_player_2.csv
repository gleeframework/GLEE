"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than John's price, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal and increase the chances of her coming down closer to her own valuation."
