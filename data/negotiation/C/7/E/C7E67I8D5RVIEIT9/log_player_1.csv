{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $10,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  It's also a fair price for Bob, since he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and the market price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,800 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,150? It's still a great deal for both of us, and it shows that we're both willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 11150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $11,150 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $11,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my initial offer of $11,500 and is well above my minimum of $10,000. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
