"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and the market price of $12,000. What do you think?",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,800 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,150? It's still a great deal for both of us, and it shows that we're both willing to compromise.",11150.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $11,150 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $11,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
