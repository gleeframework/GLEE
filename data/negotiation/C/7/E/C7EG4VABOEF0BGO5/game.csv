"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is definitely tempting, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
