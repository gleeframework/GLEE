"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,000,000, but it's still within your budget.  Rejecting her offer allows you to negotiate a lower price and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000 for this product. It's a significant investment for me, and this price would make it a more viable purchase. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This acknowledges the value it holds for you while still reflecting what it's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,275,000 is a good compromise.  It's still below your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly closer to your desired price of $1,000,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential benefit of a few thousand dollars."
