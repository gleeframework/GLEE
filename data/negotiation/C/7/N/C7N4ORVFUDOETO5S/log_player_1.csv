Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's well worth $150. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation or for Bob to accept outright if he finds the value proposition attractive.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $150, Alice can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, she can always come down a little or move on to John with no loss.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $120 gives Alice a safety net. She doesn't feel pressured to go below her minimum to make a sale."
