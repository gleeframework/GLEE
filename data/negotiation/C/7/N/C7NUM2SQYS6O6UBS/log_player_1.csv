"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for something worth so much to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000), hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum ($10,000) to allow for potential negotiation and compromise. 
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer and start a positive conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price ($10,000).** Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** I'm confident I can get a better price with a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a good backup option, but it's not my first choice.** I'm aiming to get the best price possible, and negotiation with Bob still has potential."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,200 is too far below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,850? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8850}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum ($10,000) by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing a ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Building on the Deal:** My counteroffer is a clear signal that I'm still willing to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8850 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While he's showing a willingness to compromise, $7,800 is still significantly less than my minimum price.
* **Selling to John is a strong backup option.**  At this point, I'm closer to my goal by selling to John, but I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **More negotiation room.** I believe there's still room for a more advantageous counteroffer.  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I can leverage that to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,800 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I hope you'll see it as a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm making a slight concession from my previous offer, showing flexibility while staying above my minimum price.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, implying that he's getting a good deal at $8,500.
* **Time is Running Out:** The negotiation is nearing the halfway point. It's time to start applying some pressure and signaling that my patience is wearing thin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8500 and $8000, so I'd like to propose $8250. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum price.**  While he's showing a strong interest and is willing to compromise, $8,250 is not enough for me. 
* **I have several rounds left.**  I'm not in a rush to sell, and I believe I can still push for a better price.
* **John is a strong backup option.** If I don't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for $10,000.  But I want to maximize my earnings, so I'm going to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $8,250 just won't work for me. I've made several concessions already. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to come down to $8,625. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 8625}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm explicitly labeling this as my final offer to signal that my patience is wearing thin. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Small Concession:**  I'm making another small concession, showing flexibility while still maintaining a reasonable price. 
* **Focus on the Middle Ground:** I'm reiterating the concept of meeting halfway, as it positions my offer as fair and reasonable.
* **The Threat of Other Options:** By mentioning ""other options,"" I subtly remind Bob that I have other buyers and can choose to walk away from the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm afraid $8625 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one final offer of $8000, which is the price I was willing to pay from the start. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're in Round 8, and Bob's final offer is still below my minimum. I'm running out of time and negotiation leverage.
* **No Significant Progress:** Bob's offer is only slightly better than his initial offer, indicating that he's unlikely to budge further.
* **John is a Sure Thing:** Selling to John for $10,000 is the most logical choice at this point. I'm guaranteed my minimum price, and further negotiation with Bob seems futile.

I'm prioritizing securing a good price over continuing a potentially fruitless negotiation. While I'm still hoping to earn more, I'm not willing to risk losing a guaranteed profit by holding out for a slightly higher price from Bob."
