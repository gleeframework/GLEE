{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise: it's halfway between your previous offer of $9,500 and Alice's offer of $11,000. It shows you're committed to finding a solution while still staying within your budget.  With only 4 rounds left, we need to close the deal soon or risk losing out to John."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're close to reaching a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $10150. It's still a great value, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's uniqueness and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,150.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,150 is still slightly above your budget of $10,000. With only one round left, it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price. It's best to take the guaranteed deal with John at $10,000 to avoid potentially overpaying. You've successfully negotiated a good price, but you've also learned valuable lessons about setting a firm budget and knowing when to walk away."
