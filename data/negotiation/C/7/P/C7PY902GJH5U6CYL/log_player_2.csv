"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it would be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This is a great opportunity for both of us, and I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you the most money."
