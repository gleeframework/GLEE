"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it would be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This is a great opportunity for both of us, and I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
