"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you and I'll be getting a good price for it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
