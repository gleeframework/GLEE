"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($1,000,000) and what it's worth to Bob ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build a positive relationship with Bob.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm mentioning the value of the product to emphasize its worth and justify the price. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 gives me a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail. 
* **10 Rounds:**  I have 10 rounds to work with, so I can afford to start high and gradually lower the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay a maximum of $900,000 for the product. I think it's a bit overpriced at $1,200,000. Can you consider a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. Accepting Bob's offer of $900,000 would be a loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and pay more than $800,000. There's potential to get closer to my minimum price.
* **Strategic Position:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to control the negotiation process and potentially drive up the price further.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between his offer of $900,000 and my minimum price of $1,000,000.  I'll try to find a price point that is still attractive to Bob while ensuring I receive a fair value for the product."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for us to both benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, signaling my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Win-Win:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation where both of us can benefit.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price range.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  I still have 7 rounds left, so I can continue to adjust my price if needed.
* **Monitoring John:** I'm aware that John is still a potential buyer at $1,000,000, so I'm not pressured to accept any offer below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can we compromise on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  My minimum price is $1,000,000. Accepting Bob's offer would mean taking a loss.
* **Progress:** Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and increase his offer. This indicates potential for a more favorable price. 
* **Maintaining Control:** Rejecting the offer allows me to continue to guide the negotiation and potentially drive the price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, likely in the range of $980,000 - $1,050,000.  I'll aim for a price that is close to my minimum, but also leaves room for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still need to ensure I receive a fair value for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows us to finalize the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Act:** I'm staying close to my minimum price of $1,000,000 while showing flexibility by coming down from my previous offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the unique value of the product to justify my price.
* **Finalization Focus:** I'm framing the offer as a way to finalize the deal, subtly adding pressure.

**Strategy:**

* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between my minimum price and Bob's current offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I'm getting closer to making a decision about John.
* **Potential Agreement:**  Bob might see $1,025,000 as a reasonable compromise, especially considering his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. Can we find a mutually beneficial price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:** The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. Accepting Bob's offer would be a loss.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are now in Round 6, leaving only 4 rounds to reach an agreement.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob seems unwilling to budge significantly from his $900,000 offer.
* **John's Offer:**  John is willing to buy the product for $1,000,000, which aligns with my minimum price.

**Decision:**  Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirement.  While I'd prefer to get more, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob and potentially not reaching an agreement within the remaining rounds outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
