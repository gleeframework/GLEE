{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is tempting, I can't quite let it go at that price. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I believe that reflects a fair value for both of us."",

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested.  Let's see if we can push a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000 is still a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you at $880,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While we could try to push for a bit more, Bob is clearly willing to pay a premium over John's offer. Accepting $880,000 secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of negotiations falling apart in later rounds."
