"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price. 
* Buying from John is always an option, but it's more expensive than what you might be able to get from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product holds for you, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we settle at $1,175,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its true worth.

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer of $1,175,000 is still above my maximum budget.
* I can potentially negotiate a lower price.
* While buying from John is still an option, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Alice."
