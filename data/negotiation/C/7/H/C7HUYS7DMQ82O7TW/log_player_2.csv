"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly above his maximum.  Bob should reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further, especially since she's already lowered her price once."
