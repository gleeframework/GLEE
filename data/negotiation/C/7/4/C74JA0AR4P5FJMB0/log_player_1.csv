Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you're in a strong position. Starting with a price of $1,500,000 gives you room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, attempting to justify the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob to share his thoughts, leaving space for negotiation if he counters. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed offer from John. If Bob knows about John's offer, your negotiating position weakens."
