"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking $110 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $92.50?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $92.50 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  Let's try $94.  This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product, and it lets me keep my business running.  What do you say?",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to keep your business running, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we try $91.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",91.5,Bob,6,
