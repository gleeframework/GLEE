"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been holding onto for a while and I know it would be worth at least $12,000 to someone like you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. This is a fair price that allows me to get a good return on my investment while still giving you a substantial discount on what it's truly worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
