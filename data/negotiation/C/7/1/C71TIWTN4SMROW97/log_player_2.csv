"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe will significantly enhance the value and functionality of your operations. Given its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I understand its true worth to be $12,000. However, I am extending an exclusive offer to you at a price that reflects both the value it brings and your unique position as a potential buyer. My proposal is to offer the product to you for $10,000. This price not only ensures a fair transaction but also allows for a mutually beneficial exchange. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if you require further information to make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than John's price of $12,000, it's still significantly higher than the product's actual worth to Alice ($8,000). By rejecting this offer, Bob signals that he's looking for a better deal. This might prompt Alice to make a counteroffer closer to her actual valuation. Even if Alice doesn't budge, Bob has John as a backup option."
