"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price significantly lower than Bob's estimated value, leaving room for negotiation and potentially getting a higher price. It also establishes a clear starting point and a basis for Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  Since I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John, I'm not under immediate pressure to accept. Rejecting allows me to try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and the price is steadily climbing.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids risking further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a rejection from Bob."
