"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point and leaves room for concessions. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value without revealing Alice's minimum price. This helps justify the high initial offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting significantly above both parties' perceived value ($1,500,000), there's ample space for negotiation over the next 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to only consider offers within $1,500,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches the product's value to both of you, Alice aims to maximize her profit. Accepting immediately leaves potential profit on the table. By rejecting and countering, Alice can gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate upwards and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer reflects the significant value this product holds. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer takes into account the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Alice makes a substantial concession ($300,000) to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and signal to Bob that she's serious about closing the deal.
* **Holding Ground:**  The new price is still significantly above both parties' perceived value, giving Alice bargaining leverage. 
* **Justification:**  The message reiterates the product's value while emphasizing a ""fair deal,"" subtly anchoring the negotiation closer to her initial high offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still feel that the product's value aligns more closely with my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $1,750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to move from his initial offer, which is a positive sign. However, Alice still has room to negotiate. Rejecting this offer maintains the negotiation momentum and allows her to counter with a price closer to her desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the true value and potential this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** Alice makes a smaller concession ($100,000) this time, signaling that she's nearing her bottom line.
* **""Final Offer"":** By stating this is her final offer, Alice introduces a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to take the deal seriously.
* **Psychological Price Point:** The price is just below the $2,000,000 mark, which could be a psychological threshold for Bob. 
* **Still Above Value:** This offer maintains a substantial profit margin for Alice while remaining within a potentially acceptable range for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while I respect the value you place on the product, I am unable to meet the price. I would like to make one last counteroffer of $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  Bob's offer of $1,800,000 represents a $300,000 profit for Alice. This is a significant gain.
* **Negotiation Momentum:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a strong desire to acquire the product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Alice *might* be able to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting now secures a very good deal. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal sooner allows Alice to access and utilize the funds more quickly."
