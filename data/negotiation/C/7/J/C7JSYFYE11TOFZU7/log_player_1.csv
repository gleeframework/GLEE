Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still outside my price range. I'm prepared to pay $1100000, which is a good compromise considering our previous offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1125000. It's still a significant saving for you compared to your initial price, and it's the most I can afford at this point. Let's make this deal happen.
