{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still allows room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price ($150) as possible, while also making sure Bob doesn't feel like he's being taken advantage of. If he rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to counter, but I'll also be watching the clock and considering John's guaranteed $150 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  While I'd prefer to make a sale, $120 is simply not enough. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum and see if we can find some middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $120 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a fantastic price for the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know if you're interested in making this work."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $140 is still above my preferred budget, I would like to propose $130 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your needs and expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting.  I'm going to counter with a final offer. If Bob rejects it, I'll sell to John for the guaranteed $150."

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's not willing to go higher than $130, and that's still below my minimum.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 from John and move on."
