"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 to start the negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. $200 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
```

I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. There's a good chance she'll counter, giving us room to work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $60 is too low for me. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still too high. We'll counteroffer again, trying to edge closer to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $100?"",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows Willingness to Negotiate:** By suggesting a split, we signal to Alice that we are serious about reaching a deal and are willing to compromise. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $100 keeps us below our $120 maximum while still being a significant jump from our initial low offer. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
