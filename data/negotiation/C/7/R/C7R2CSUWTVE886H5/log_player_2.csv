"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice at $950,000 saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the guaranteed savings of $50,000 outweighs the risk of further negotiation."
