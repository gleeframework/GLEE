Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that holds significant value. Considering its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair deal considering its value to you is even greater."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and there's still room to go down while remaining above your minimum.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup buyer."
