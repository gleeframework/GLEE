Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
It's tempting to take the $950,000, but I'm holding out for a bit more. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget concerns.  While $950,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to reach a figure that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still allow me to make a profit while ensuring you get a great deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

This is a good deal for me. I'm happy to accept Bob's offer of $1,050,000. This price is closer to my minimum value than John's offer, and it seems like Bob is getting close to his budget limit. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on a sale."
