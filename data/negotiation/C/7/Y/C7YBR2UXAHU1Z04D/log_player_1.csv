{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than John's offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $100 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I have room to negotiate further with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $150, there's a chance that I could negotiate a better price with Bob, potentially earning more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $115? I'm confident you'll find this product valuable, and I want to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counter-offer is a compromise between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate while also maintaining a price point closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive Language:**  I use positive language to keep the conversation amicable and encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of its potential benefits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of Loss:** If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's a chance that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $150.
* **Opportunity Cost:** By accepting this offer, I can secure a sale quickly and avoid the potential for a longer negotiation with Bob, which might ultimately result in a lower price. 

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $130,  accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that is still favorable considering my minimum acceptable price."
