Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer on that price point.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is firm on her price of $11,250. While this is lower than John's price, it's still too high for your target of $12,000.  You've already made several counteroffers and it seems like Alice won't budge.  It's better to go with John at this point."
