"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $750000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $750000. I'm willing to pay up to $720000, but I need to be comfortable with the price. Can you consider this as a compromise?",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $720000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm offering a price of $730000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise.",730000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with $730000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $725000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider this as a final offer?",725000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too close to the price I'm willing to pay from John. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I can do $730000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",730000.0,Bob,8,
