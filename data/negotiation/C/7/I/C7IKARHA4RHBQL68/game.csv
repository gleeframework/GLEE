"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we settle around $750,000?  I think that's a fair price that still gives you a good return.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $750,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for me. Let's find a compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That seems like a reasonable compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
