"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a good price. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is serious about buying and where his willingness to pay falls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still holding firm on a price that ensures I get a good return on the product. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer remains unchanged. I'm going to reject his offer again and try to reach a higher price through further negotiation. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better price than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come up with a higher offer. This price is still above John's offer, making it more worthwhile to continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can push for a slightly higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to move further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $850,000. This is only slightly higher than Bob's offer and signals that I'm willing to close the deal. It's important to show willingness to compromise while maintaining a strong negotiating position. This round could be the deciding factor, so I'm aiming for a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 2 rounds left, Bob's offer hasn't changed. He's clearly not willing to negotiate much further.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of a further price reduction."
