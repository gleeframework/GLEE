Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This means any price above that is likely a no-go.
* **Your Goal:** Maximize your profit. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. However, you don't want to be so aggressive that you scare him off.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $900,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and avoids unnecessary jargon.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting ""unique value"" and ""true worth"" subtly justifies the higher price.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The $100,000 markup provides some wiggle room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob might counter-offer. Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go. 
* **Consider Alternatives:** If Bob rejects this offer, you could try a lower offer before going to John. However, remember your fallback of $800,000."
