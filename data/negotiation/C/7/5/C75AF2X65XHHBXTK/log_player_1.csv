I'm starting with a price higher than what I'm willing to accept from John, hoping to get a higher price from Bob.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is still offering too low. I'll make one more counteroffer, but if he rejects again, I'll sell to John."

This is my final offer. It's a fair price that's close to my minimum, but I'm willing to take a slight loss to avoid selling to John. If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John."
