Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $180.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation or a counter-offer from Bob. 
* **Not Too High:** While I want to maximize profit, setting the price too high ($250, for example) might make Bob immediately lose interest without even trying to negotiate.  
* **Knowing Your Worth:**  I know John is a guaranteed sale at $150, so I'm not desperate. This allows me to confidently aim higher with Bob."
