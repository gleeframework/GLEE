"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident this product will be highly valuable to your business.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a profitable deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential partnership, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still represents a significant value for you. Let's find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This would allow me to purchase the product while ensuring you receive a fair profit.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for me. I believe this offer represents a win-win for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
