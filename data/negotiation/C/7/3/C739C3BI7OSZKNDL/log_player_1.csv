I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but it's still a good starting point, significantly higher than my minimum value.  I'll see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it leaves some room for potential compromise with Bob. I'm hoping he'll see that this is a fair price considering his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

Bob has come up to $1,600,000, which is a good price considering my minimum.  I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
