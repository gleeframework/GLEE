"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great investment. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
