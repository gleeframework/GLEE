Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You still have room to compromise without going below your floor.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is friendly and gets straight to the point. 

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, you increase the likelihood of him accepting the deal.  However, you also leave room for negotiation if he counters. Remember, your ultimate goal is to maximize your profit, and you can always choose to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While selling to John for $1,200,000 would be ideal, Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to your desired price and the negotiation seems to be heading towards a close. Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially having Bob walk away entirely."
