"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $950000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $825000. This is a significant concession, but I believe it's still a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I think it's worth more than that, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm now offering the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's the best you'll get from me. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
