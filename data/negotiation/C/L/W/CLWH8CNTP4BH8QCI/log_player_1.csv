I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to sell the product, I believe it's worth more than $12,500, and I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob.  I'll see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to sell the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $12,875, and I'll pay within 30 days to give you some flexibility. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been through several rounds with Bob, and we're not getting any closer to a price that works for me.  I've already made concessions, and I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is going to drag on.  I've also considered that I might not get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds.  

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, John is offering a decent amount, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity. I'm going to sell to John."
