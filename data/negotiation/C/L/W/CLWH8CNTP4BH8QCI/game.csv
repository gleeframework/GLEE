"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's a fair price for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  However, I'm willing to make one last concession. Let's split the difference between our last offers and settle at $13,062.50. This is a fair price, and I don't want to go any lower.",13062.5,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $12,875. However, I'd like to propose a one-time payment of the full amount, rather than negotiating a payment plan. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like this negotiation isn't going anywhere. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this is my final offer.  Let's settle at $13,000. I'm not willing to go lower, and if we can't agree, I'll be selling to someone else.",13000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to sell the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $12,875, and I'll pay within 30 days to give you some flexibility. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12875.0,Bob,8,
