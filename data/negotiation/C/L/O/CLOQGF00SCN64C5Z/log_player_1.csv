"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum, but not too high to scare Bob away. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and potentially start a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm countering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum. I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still hoping for a better price than $14,200.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14100}
``` 

I'm going to try a slightly higher counteroffer, hoping to get a better price but not risk losing the deal. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a price closer to $14,100, Bob's offer is very close to that. I've already rejected his offer twice, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
