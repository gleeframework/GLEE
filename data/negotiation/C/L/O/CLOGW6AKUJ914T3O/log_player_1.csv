Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the asset's worth and potential. "",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Aim high to leave room for negotiation. While Bob's valuation is $800,000, starting closer to your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) increases the chance of securing a higher final price.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" without revealing your bottom line. This encourages Bob to consider the potential benefits, potentially justifying a price higher than his initial valuation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The wording ""initially proposing"" signals your willingness to negotiate, which can be crucial in closing the deal. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale. If Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still room to negotiate downwards, knowing John guarantees the $1,500,000 backup."
