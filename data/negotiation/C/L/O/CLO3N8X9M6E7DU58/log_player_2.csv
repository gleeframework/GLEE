This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice's Limit:**  She's indicated this is her final offer and it's at her product's value. Pushing further is unlikely and could risk the deal.
* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $400,000 less than John's price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing might yield small gains, but there's a risk Alice walks away.  

Accepting at $800,000 secures a significant discount and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
