I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a price that is still significantly above his perceived value, but leaves some room for negotiation if he wants to try and get a better deal. 

By starting with a high price, I can potentially maximize my profits, and if Bob rejects it, I have the option to counteroffer or move on to John who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired value of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $11,000, but still above his offer of $9,500. I believe this price is fair, considering his value for the product and my need to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum but still below it. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not confident I can get him to go any higher. To avoid further haggling and ensure I meet my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000."
