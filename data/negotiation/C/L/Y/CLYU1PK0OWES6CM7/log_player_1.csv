Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $11500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
