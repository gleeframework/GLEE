Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a good price, but not unreasonable.  $13,000 is a good starting point since it leaves room for negotiation and is still significantly above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob to make the offer seem more appealing. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message conveys that I'm open to discussion and willing to find a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Excellent! I've secured a profitable sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess Bob's counteroffer and decide whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for the guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Risk assessment:**  Selling to John guarantees $10,000, but I'm willing to risk a bit more to potentially get closer to my goal of $13,000 or higher.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between his offer of $11,500 and my previous offer of $13,000.  I'll need to carefully consider the risk of further negotiation versus the potential reward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $11,500 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price.  How about we split the difference and agree on $12,250?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm aiming for a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a clear reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value to both parties.
* **Positive framing:** I use positive language like ""good deal"" to create a more agreeable tone. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good price, close to my initial goal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to evaluate the situation. If Bob continues to make low offers, I might consider selling to John for the guaranteed $10,000."
