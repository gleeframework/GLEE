"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price considering its value to you.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price seems a bit high to me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $10,800 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle at $9,500? That would be a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $10,200. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring I make a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very understanding, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $9,850?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",9850.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $10,100. This is the absolute lowest I can go. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10100.0,Alice,7,
