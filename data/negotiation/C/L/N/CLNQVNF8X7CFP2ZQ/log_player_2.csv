"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is quite high, close to my maximum budget and significantly above her own valuation. I have room to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price seems a bit high to me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is moving closer to her valuation, but it's still too high for me. I will continue negotiating to see if I can get a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $10,800 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle at $9,500? That would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $10,200. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring I make a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price I might accept, but I still think there's room for negotiation. It's worth one more counter-offer to see if she'll go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you've been very understanding, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $9,850?  That feels like a fair deal to me."", ""product_price"": 9850}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $10,100. This is the absolute lowest I can go. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is holding firm at $10,000, and her latest offer is only $100 away from that.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and continuing to negotiate might make me lose the deal altogether. Accepting this offer gets me the product for significantly less than John's price."
