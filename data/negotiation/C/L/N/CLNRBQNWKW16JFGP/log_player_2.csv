"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice's offer of $14,000 is lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **You still get a good deal:**  While Alice's offer is not the absolute lowest possible price, it's still within your budget and saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
