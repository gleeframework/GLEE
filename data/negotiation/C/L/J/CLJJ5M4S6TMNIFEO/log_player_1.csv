Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price, but I'm also prepared to accept John's offer of $12,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to accept that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm lowering my price to $10,000, which is still above my minimum value of $12,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away for cheap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement.  If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $9,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price. If he rejects this offer, I'll go with John's offer."
