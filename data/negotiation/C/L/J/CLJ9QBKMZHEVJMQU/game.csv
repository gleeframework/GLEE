"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $20000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to me is no less than $15000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a strong price to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
