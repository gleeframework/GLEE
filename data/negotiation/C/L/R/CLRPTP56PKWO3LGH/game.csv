"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $950000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $850000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can strike a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $890000? This is a slight adjustment from my last offer, and I believe it's a good compromise that allows us both to achieve a positive outcome. Let me know what you think.",890000.0,Alice,5,
