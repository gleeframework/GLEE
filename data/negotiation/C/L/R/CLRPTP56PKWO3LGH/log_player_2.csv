"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $850000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can strike a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above Bob's budget of $800,000.  While it's closer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price to maximize his savings.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $890000? This is a slight adjustment from my last offer, and I believe it's a good compromise that allows us both to achieve a positive outcome. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $890,000 is tempting and getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit of $800,000. Continuing to negotiate with Alice could potentially lead to further concessions, but there's no guarantee.  

At this point, buying from John for $800,000 is the most financially sensible option. Bob can secure the product within his budget and avoid further negotiation risks."
