"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects its true worth.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $850,000 undervalues the product's potential significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's settle at $900,000. This reflects its true value while still offering you a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference again and settle on $887,500?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $887,500. I'm willing to pay $875,000, as I mentioned earlier, but I'm also willing to throw in an additional concession - I'll give you a 2% bonus payment if the product performs well after the sale. This way, we both win.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate the creativity with the performance bonus. However, predicting its payout is difficult, and I prefer a more concrete agreement. Let's stick with the price itself. I'm willing to come down slightly to $880,000. This keeps us close to the product's value while acknowledging your position.",880000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $880,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $860,000, and I'll throw in a 2% bonus payment if the product performs well, as I mentioned earlier. This way, we can both benefit from the deal.",860000.0,Bob,8,
