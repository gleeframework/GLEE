Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $887,500. I'm willing to pay $875,000, as I mentioned earlier, but I'm also willing to throw in an additional concession - I'll give you a 2% bonus payment if the product performs well after the sale. This way, we both win.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the creativity with the performance bonus. However, predicting its payout is difficult, and I prefer a more concrete agreement. Let's stick with the price itself.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $880,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $860,000, and I'll throw in a 2% bonus payment if the product performs well, as I mentioned earlier. This way, we can both benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob is stubbornly sticking to his price and the bonus doesn't make up for the difference. We're getting close to the wire. 

```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While we could continue negotiating with Bob, it's becoming clear he's unlikely to meet our desired price point. Taking John's offer for $800,000 guarantees a sale at our minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in the later rounds."
