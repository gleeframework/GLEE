"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm confident it's worth at least $20,000 to someone with your needs. To give you a head start, I'm offering it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way too high.  You're aiming to pay no more than $10,000.  Rejecting the offer is the best move for the first round. You want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify going above $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your initial offer, but $18,000 is already a significant discount on what this product is worth. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for a price that's higher than your ideal. While $14,000 is a decent compromise, it's still worth trying to push for a lower price. You have 7 rounds left and can still get a better deal by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $14,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit too far apart. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  It's the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point, but I also need to be fair to myself. This product is worth a lot to me, and $10,000 just doesn't reflect that value.  What if we try $12,500? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is closer to your target than previous offers, you still have 5 rounds left.  It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further, especially since she stated this is her ""final offer.""  You can counter with a slightly higher offer than your target price to see if there's room for compromise.  However, if the negotiations stall or Alice makes a counteroffer you don't like, you can always fall back to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,500.  I'm still a bit over budget, but I'm willing to go a little higher.  How about $11,500? It's a fair compromise that keeps us both in the game."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to accept a small compromise. How about $12,000, and we have a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is tempting, you're still above your target price and have three rounds left. You've shown Alice you're willing to negotiate, and she's coming down.  It's worth seeing if you can push for a lower price, perhaps $11,500 again, or even $11,000.  If you're unsuccessful, you can always fall back to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $12,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $11,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
