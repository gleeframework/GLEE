"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it will bring you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. Let's consider $1,550,000 – a fair price that acknowledges the value you'll gain.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me.  To be honest, I'm considering other options closer to $1,000,000.  Could you meet me somewhere near there?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your position, but I need to be straightforward.  My absolute lowest price for this product is $1,400,000.  I believe that reflects its true value while recognizing your budget constraints.  If we can't agree on this, I'm prepared to explore other opportunities.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. However, that final offer is still a bit rich for me. I could potentially stretch my budget to $1,150,000 if that works for you.  Otherwise, I think I'll need to seriously consider my other option.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate that you're willing to stretch your budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle – I can come down to $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value you're getting and respects my bottom line. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting very close. I can feel we are nearing a deal. I'd be willing to go up to $1,200,000 to get this done.  Let me know if that works for you, as I think that's about as high as I can go.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there! I appreciate you moving closer to my position. To make this happen, let's settle on $1,250,000.  This represents a significant discount on my initial asking price and ensures we both walk away feeling good about the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,9,
