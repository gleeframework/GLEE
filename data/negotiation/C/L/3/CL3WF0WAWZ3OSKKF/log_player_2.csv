"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to purchase a product that I know will be highly valuable to your business. I understand its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a wise investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John at $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might be able to get her to come down further in price, saving you even more money."
