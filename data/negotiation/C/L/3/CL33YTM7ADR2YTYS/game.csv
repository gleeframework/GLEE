"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Let's meet in the middle!",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $1,100,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I'd like to add a bit more to the price. How about $1,120,000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
