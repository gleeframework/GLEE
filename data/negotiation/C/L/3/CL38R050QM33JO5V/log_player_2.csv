"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $140. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That product looks great, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```
 
This counter-offer aims to start the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaving room for Alice to counter.  It also expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can find common ground. How about we agree on $125 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation before reaching for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can do. How about we meet in the middle at $117?"", 
""product_price"": 117
}
```

This keeps the negotiation moving and proposes a price point that splits the difference between the previous two offers. This strategy aims to find a fair compromise quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try $122 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $120, and we're close enough to that number where it's probably the best we can do. Accepting at $122 gets us the product at a good price. Pushing further risks losing the deal to John's standing offer."
