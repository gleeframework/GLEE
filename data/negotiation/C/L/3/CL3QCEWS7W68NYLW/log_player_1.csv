Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique item with significant value that I believe would be highly beneficial for you. "",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. We need to offer a price that's attractive but leaves room for profit.
* **Our Minimum:** We absolutely won't sell for less than $1,500,000 (our guaranteed sale to John).
* **Finding a Sweet Spot:** Offering a price between $1,000,001 and $1,499,999 gives Bob a chance to profit while ensuring we get more than our minimum.
* **The Chosen Price:** $1,350,000 aims for a significant profit while still being potentially appealing to Bob. It allows for some negotiation room if Bob tries to counter-offer."
