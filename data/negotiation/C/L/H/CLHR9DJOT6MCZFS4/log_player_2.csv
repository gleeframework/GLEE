"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,250,000? That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum limit of $1,200,000.  You can likely negotiate a lower price and still get a good deal. You have 7 rounds left, so rejecting and counter-offering again is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
