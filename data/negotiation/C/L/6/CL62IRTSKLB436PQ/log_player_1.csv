"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to start by asking for my full value of $1,200,000. This is a high starting point, but I have a backup option with John, so I can afford to be firm.  It's possible Bob will accept this right away, but if not, I'll be prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take $900,000, it's too far below my minimum value. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial asking price, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway. If not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's getting closer, I'm not yet ready to settle.  I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating.  I'm also aware of the backup option with John, so I'm not under pressure to accept anything less than my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a further compromise, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and entice Bob to accept. If not, I'll have to consider my options more carefully."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's getting closer, I'm not yet ready to settle.  I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating.  I'm also aware of the backup option with John, so I'm not under pressure to accept anything less than my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,025,000. This is another compromise, bringing me closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows my willingness to meet him halfway and encourages him to accept. If not, I'm starting to run out of rounds, and I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's getting closer, I'm not yet ready to settle. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating.  I'm also aware of the backup option with John, so I'm not under pressure to accept anything less than my minimum value. I only have two rounds left, so I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to meet Bob at his last offer of $990,000, but I'm adding a little bit more to show good faith. We're very close to a deal, and I hope he will accept. However, if he doesn't, I will be selling to John in the next round."
