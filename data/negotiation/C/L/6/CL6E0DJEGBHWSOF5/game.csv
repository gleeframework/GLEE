"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product might be subjective, but based on my research, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to $10000. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  This product is worth a lot more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500? That's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.  Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000.  This product is truly unique and I'm confident it's worth more than that.  Let's compromise at $11500.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While I value your offer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $11500. Would you be willing to go up to $11400? This would be a good middle ground and allow us to finalize this deal. Let's make it happen!",11400.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm just a little bit shy of my target price. Would you be willing to go up to $11400? That's just $50 more than your last offer. This would be a great compromise and allow us to finally close this deal.  Let's make this happen!",11400.0,Alice,9,
