"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82 and $75. How about we try $78.50? It's a small concession from my original offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",78.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I need to stick to my budget. How about we settle at $77? That's my final offer.",77.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $77. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $79. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",79.0,Alice,7,
