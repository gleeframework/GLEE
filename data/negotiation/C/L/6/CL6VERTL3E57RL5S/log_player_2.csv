Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82 and $75. How about we try $78.50? It's a small concession from my original offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $77. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $79. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $79.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $80, it makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might save you $1, but it also risks ending up with a price higher than John's."
