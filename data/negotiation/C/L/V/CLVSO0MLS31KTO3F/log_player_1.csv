Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a safety net at $10,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The $9,500 starting point allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but even if he negotiates down slightly, Alice is still above her minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting high but expressing a willingness to negotiate, Alice presents herself as flexible while still valuing the product highly. This approach can be more effective than starting at her absolute minimum."
