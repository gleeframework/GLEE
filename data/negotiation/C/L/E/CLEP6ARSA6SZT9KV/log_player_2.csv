"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's starting price is too high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?"",

This counteroffer attempts to bring the price significantly closer to Alice's perceived value of the product while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but $13,000 is still closer to our maximum budget than a fair price. Let's see if we can push her a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand we're both trying to find a fair price, Alice.  How about $11,500? That feels like a good compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference from the previous round while still leaning towards a price favorable to us. It also introduces a sense of compromise to encourage Alice to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice is barely budging on price. It seems unlikely she'll come down significantly more. It's time to switch tactics and consider our alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but I'm afraid we're just too far apart.  I can offer you $12,000, but that's my final offer. Otherwise, I'll need to go with another seller."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

This counteroffer does a few things:

* **Presents a firm stance:** By stating this is our ""final offer,"" we signal to Alice that further negotiation is unlikely.
* **Offers a price above her value:**  By offering $12,000, we ensure Alice makes a profit, which may be enticing enough for her to accept.
* **Introduces an alternative:** By mentioning we have another option, we add pressure for Alice to make a decision without forcing her below her known value.

This strategy creates a clear choice for Alice while still aiming for a price favorable to us."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000, Bob. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at $13,000, I'm willing to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's clear Alice won't budge below $13,000.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly better than John's offer of $15,000. It makes more sense to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
