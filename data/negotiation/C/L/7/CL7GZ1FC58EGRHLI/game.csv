"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  While I recognize the value of the product, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a significant discount from your initial offer.  I believe this price reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great value for this exceptional product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth and aligns with your budget.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still committed to making this deal work, but $900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
