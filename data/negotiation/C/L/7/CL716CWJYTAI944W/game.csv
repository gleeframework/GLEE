"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $1,400,000 is certainly a substantial sum, it doesn't fully reflect the inherent value of this product and its potential for even greater returns. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and potential returns.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I can see you recognize the unique value of this product. Let's bridge this gap â€“ I propose $1,625,000. This reflects a commitment to finding common ground while acknowledging the product's worth.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, and I'm glad we're getting closer. However, $1,625,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,575,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1575000.0,Bob,6,
