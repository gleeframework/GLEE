Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $8000.,15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $15000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in the product but I can't go higher than $9000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering our previous discussions.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we settle on $10000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is the best I can do, considering the value I place on the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
