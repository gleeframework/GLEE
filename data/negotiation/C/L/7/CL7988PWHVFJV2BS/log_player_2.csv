"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you're aiming to save money and the product is worth $150 to you, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $75 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
``` 

I'm going to offer $60. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. If she rejects, we can continue to counteroffer, but I want to show her I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is still above your target price of $60. While $70 is better than $75, it's worth pushing for that lower price.  You have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65}
```

I'm going to offer $65. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and a good opportunity for Alice to accept. If she rejects, I'll be prepared to go back and forth with her a few more times, but I'm hoping to close the deal this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is being stubborn, but we're still getting closer to our target price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation moving and shows Alice we're serious about finding a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 68}
```

We're getting close!  I'm going to offer $68.  This is a reasonable compromise, and if Alice rejects, we're only a few dollars apart."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $73. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $73
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and the offers are getting close to my maximum price. While I could continue negotiating,  it's more likely that Alice will keep her price higher. Buying from John for $150 is the safer option to ensure I get the product."
