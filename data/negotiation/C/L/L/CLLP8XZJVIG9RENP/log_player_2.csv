"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within his budget, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given my budget and the value of this product to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident this product will bring you significant value beyond that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his next offer and he'll be forced to buy from John.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures a deal within his budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
