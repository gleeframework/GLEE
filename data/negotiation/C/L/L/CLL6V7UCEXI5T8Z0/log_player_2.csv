"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a counteroffer lower than what you're ultimately willing to pay. This gives you room to bargain upwards.
* **Respectful Tone:** We maintain a polite and respectful tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Clear Target:** The offer of $70 sets a clear target, giving Alice a concrete figure to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down a bit, $85 is still closer to her asking price than our target. There's likely room for further negotiation.
* **Time Constraint:** We have plenty of rounds left, so there's no need to rush into accepting a price that isn't ideal. 
* **John's Offer as Backup:** We always have John's offer of $100 as a fallback option if we can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $78?  That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 78
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:** We're inching closer to a potential agreement by increasing our offer. This shows Alice we're willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $78 is a price point that is slightly above the midpoint between our initial offer ($70) and her current offer ($85). This aims to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired range. 
* **Justification:**  By framing it as a ""fair price for both of us,"" we're emphasizing the mutually beneficial aspect of the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob. But I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $82.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Down Concessions:**  While Alice is moving closer to our target price, her concessions are getting smaller. We don't want to appear overly eager.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, we can gauge how much further down Alice is willing to go. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  We still have several rounds left and the option of buying from John, so we're not in a rush to settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""This is getting us closer, Alice. I'd be willing to do $80, which is a very fair offer considering the value."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Critical Point:** We're now very close to Alice's known valuation of the product ($80).  Offering her this price tests whether she's truly willing to accept a small profit margin.
* **Stronger Justification:**  We're emphasizing that $80 is a ""very fair"" offer, highlighting that we're not trying to lowball her.
* **Potential Breaking Point:**  If Alice rejects this offer, it might signal that she's not willing to go any lower. We might have to consider accepting a slightly higher price or moving on to John in the next round or two."
