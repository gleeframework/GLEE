"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice at $9,500 is cheaper than buying from John at $10,000. 
* While Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000), it's still within your budget ($10,000) and saves you money."
