Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and this price reflects that."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and might even surprise you.
* **Gauge Interest:** Bob's reaction to this initial high price will give you an idea of his level of interest and potential budget. 
* **Fallback Option:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. This knowledge gives you leverage and confidence in negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:**  While $14,000 is a decent offer, it's still $4,000 less than your minimum and above Bob's perceived value. There's room for negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** You have the security of John's offer, allowing you to push for a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Step:**  Counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $17,000-$18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is significant. I could meet you at $17,500. This is a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 17500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):** This counteroffer signals a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position. It's slightly closer to your original price than Bob's, but shows movement.
* **Justifying the Value:** By reiterating the product's value, you're reminding Bob of its worth and why a higher price is justified.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's still some wiggle room for further negotiation if Bob counters, but you're clearly aiming for a price above $17,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $17,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13,500. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I really need to stay under $15,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unlikely to Budge:** Bob has explicitly stated his budget is under $15,000. His offer of $13,500 shows he's unlikely to significantly increase his price.
* **John Guarantees Profit:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John. It's not worth potentially losing this opportunity and engaging in further drawn-out negotiations with Bob for a smaller gain. 

**Conclusion:** While you could try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the risk outweighs the potential reward. Selling to John ensures a clean, profitable deal."
