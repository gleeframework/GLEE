Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm asking $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting at $100. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $120, making the offer appealing to Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters, allowing me to potentially increase the price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have John as a backup buyer, providing a guarantee of $120 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price John is offering it to me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd like to get.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my desired amount.
* **John's Offer:**  While $120 from John is tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about $95?  This would be a fair compromise and still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not going all the way.
* **Motivation:**  By suggesting a ""fair compromise,"" I'm subtly trying to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Margin for Error:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, giving me some room if Bob wants to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $92.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited Upward Potential:** There's not much room for further negotiation. It's unlikely Bob will go higher, and if I counter, he might just walk away.
* **Risk of Loss:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing him as a buyer and having to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Time Factor:** While $120 from John is ideal, I'm not sure how long I can wait for him, and I'm at risk of losing the sale if I keep negotiating with Bob. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer at $92.50 is the most sensible option. It's a good deal for both of us and ensures a quick sale."
