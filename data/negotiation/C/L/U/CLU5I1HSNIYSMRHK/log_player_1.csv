Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning listing it publicly, I'm implying scarcity and that he might miss out if he doesn't act.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I don't want to start so high ($20,000+) that it discourages Bob from countering.  A starting price of $15,000 leaves room for him to negotiate down while still potentially landing above my minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects it, I can always counter with a lower price, moving closer to my $12,000 minimum."
