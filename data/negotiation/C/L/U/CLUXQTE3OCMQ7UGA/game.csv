"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $950,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be willing to consider $900,000? It's a fair offer that brings us closer to a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable throughout this negotiation, and I respect that.  $925,000 is very close, but to be honest with you, my absolute limit is $910,000. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $910,000 is your absolute limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $915,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,7,
