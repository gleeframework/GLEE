"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and it's more than my minimum asking price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting (saving $200,000), there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if a better price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to buy your product for $900,000.  It's still a good deal for you, as it's significantly above your minimum asking price, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It allows me to save $250,000 compared to buying from John, and it's still a good deal for Alice as she's getting more than her minimum asking price.  Further negotiation might save a little more, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $1,200,000 isn't worth it."
