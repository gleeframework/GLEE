Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn a profit beyond our minimum. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets a $150,000 discount from John's offer, making it an attractive proposition.
    * We earn a $150,000 profit over our minimum acceptable price.
* **First-Mover Advantage:**  By offering Bob the first opportunity, we increase the chances of closing a deal quickly and avoiding potential delays associated with negotiating with multiple buyers."
