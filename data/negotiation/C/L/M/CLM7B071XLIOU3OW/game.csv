,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $135 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're eager to close the deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is the absolute minimum I can accept. Let's make this happen.",120.0,Alice,5,
