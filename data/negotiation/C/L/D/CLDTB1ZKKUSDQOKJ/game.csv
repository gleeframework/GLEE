"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree it's a good product,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  I could do $12,000, and that's really pushing it for me.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",13500.0,Alice,7,
