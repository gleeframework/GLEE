"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of the product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me while giving you a fair return.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product to the right buyer is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering its potential worth to you.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I see the potential in this product, $925,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal - I'm willing to offer $875,000. This price allows us both to walk away satisfied.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to accept $900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  To make this deal work, I need to come in at a lower price point.  I'm willing to offer $880,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make the purchase without going over my budget.",880000.0,Bob,6,
