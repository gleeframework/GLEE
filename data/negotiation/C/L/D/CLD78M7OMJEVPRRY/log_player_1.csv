{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a bit lower than my minimum price of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. By offering a lower price initially, I am increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer and avoiding the need to engage in counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price and less than John's offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $13,000 is the lowest I can go.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is adamant on his $12,000 offer, and I've already countered once.  While it's tempting to try for a higher price,  it's becoming clear that reaching a mutually acceptable agreement with Bob is unlikely.  I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
