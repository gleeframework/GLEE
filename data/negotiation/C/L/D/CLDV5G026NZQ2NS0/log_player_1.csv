Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your confidence in the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and provides a fair margin for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,175,000 is still outside my target price range.  I'm ready to close the deal at $1,100,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's get this done!
