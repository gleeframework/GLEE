Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and what his budget might be.  I'm also keeping the option open to sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a compromise closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,500. This is halfway between my initial offer and his offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise, while still making sure I get a price that's closer to my desired value."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial goal, it's a fair compromise, and I'm happy to secure the sale at this price. Selling to John would only yield $12,000, which is less than what Bob is offering.  I believe it's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer and move on."
