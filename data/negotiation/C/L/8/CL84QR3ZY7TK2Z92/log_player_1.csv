""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to aim for the maximum profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel more in control of the process.
* **Backup Plan:** I always have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is above my absolute minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price and closer to my baseline.  There's room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer to see if I can nudge him closer to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm confident in the value this product brings, and  $1,225,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects a more accurate assessment of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've significantly lowered my price from the initial offer, signaling flexibility, but not drastically. This aims to meet somewhere in the middle ground between our positions.
* **Strong Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and prevent Bob from anchoring too low.
* **Maintaining a Buffer:** My counteroffer is still comfortably above my absolute bottom line, allowing room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,275,000. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently trying to anchor the price closer to my minimum. While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting his offer of $1,275,000 is a good deal:

* **Profitable:** It's significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), securing a solid profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Bob might walk away, or the price increases might be marginal.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further delays and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
