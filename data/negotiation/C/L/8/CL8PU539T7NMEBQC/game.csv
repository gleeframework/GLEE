"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1500000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1100000 is still a little steep. I'm willing to go to $1000000. This would give you a healthy profit and would be a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
