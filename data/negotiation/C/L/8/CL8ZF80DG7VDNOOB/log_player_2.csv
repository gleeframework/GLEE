"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is too high. We know we can get it cheaper, either from Alice through negotiation or from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We begin with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still comfortably above her valuation. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is courteous and explains that the initial price is too high while expressing continued interest.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer sets the stage for a potential agreement somewhere between $100 and $130, allowing us to hopefully secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $115 is a reasonable price, saving us $35 compared to John's offer and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate by meeting us halfway. Accepting shows good faith and likely prevents further haggling. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but the potential savings are unlikely to be significant enough to warrant the additional time and effort."
