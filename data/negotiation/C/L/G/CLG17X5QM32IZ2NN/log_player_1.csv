"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, aiming for a good starting point. This allows for potential negotiation room while still giving me a healthy profit.  I'm also expressing confidence in the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $140 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum value in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $160? This is still a great price for a product worth much more. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise by meeting Bob halfway.  Offering $160 shows I'm open to negotiation while still remaining above my minimum value.  I'm also reinforcing the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is exactly my minimum value.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
