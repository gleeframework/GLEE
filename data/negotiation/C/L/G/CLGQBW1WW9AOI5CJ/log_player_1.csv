Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired selling point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is still a good deal, I can potentially get closer to my desired price of $1,150,000.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $1,075,000? This would allow us both to walk away with a reasonable deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $1,075,000 is still a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price than John's offer. I'm also concerned about running out of rounds and having to settle for John's lower offer."
