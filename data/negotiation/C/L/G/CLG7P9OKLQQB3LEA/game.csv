"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price is still fair and allows for a healthy profit for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference and settle at $750,000? It seems like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000,  which is a significant compromise on my part. This offer is truly the best I can do, considering the value of this product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right this product is valuable, and I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we finalize the deal at $775,000?  This reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,
