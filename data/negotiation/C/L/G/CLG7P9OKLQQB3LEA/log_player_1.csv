"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than the product's value to me, but still within a range Bob might be willing to pay.  This sets a strong opening position and gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $650,000 is higher than my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price yet. I have ten rounds to work with, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price is still fair and allows for a healthy profit for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference and settle at $750,000? It seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable settling there. I'm aiming for a higher price, and I still have six rounds left. I'm going to counteroffer and try to inch closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000,  which is a significant compromise on my part. This offer is truly the best I can do, considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right this product is valuable, and I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we finalize the deal at $775,000?  This reflects a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $800,000, I'm running out of rounds. Bob seems determined to get the price down to the low 700s, and I don't want to risk losing the deal. Accepting his offer ensures I get a sale that's significantly higher than my minimum, and I'll still have a good profit."
