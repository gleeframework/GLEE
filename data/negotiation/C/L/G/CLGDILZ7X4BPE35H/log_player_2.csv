"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $10,000 is better than John's $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still higher than her minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* This shows I'm serious about buying the product but I'm also trying to get a good deal. 
*  This leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,250 is closer to my ideal price but still leaves room for negotiation. 
*  Since I'm aiming to save as much as possible, I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating. 
* I believe I can still get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

*  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm serious about making a deal. 
* My offer of $9,000 is closer to Alice's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* This counteroffer should keep the negotiations moving towards a deal within the 10 rounds."
