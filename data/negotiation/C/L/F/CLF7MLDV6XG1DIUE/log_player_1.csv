Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate.  He might counter-offer, but you have a comfortable buffer before hitting your minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Highlighting:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, potentially swaying Bob to accept the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's guaranteed purchase. 
* Bob might be turned off by the high initial price. You'll need to be prepared to negotiate if he rejects or counters."
