"Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $120?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $135?  That's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you at $155, but that's as low as I can go.",155.0,Alice,5,
