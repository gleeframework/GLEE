"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob is willing to pay.  This allows room for negotiation and also signals that I'm confident in the value of my product.  I'm also trying to build a positive rapport by being friendly and highlighting the product's benefits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept such a low price so early in the process.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $125 is too low for me to accept at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $135 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'll need to be careful not to go too low too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $135 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $140.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can finalize the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $130 for your product. I believe this is a reasonable price for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to my minimum price, but I'm running out of rounds. Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing more time and potentially lowering my price further. It's better to sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
