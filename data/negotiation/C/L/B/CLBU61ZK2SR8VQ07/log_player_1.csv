Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 13500} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. This way, I can see if Bob is willing to pay more than $10,000, and I can also get an idea of how flexible he's willing to be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value of $15,000, so I cannot accept it. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still staying above Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.  I'm hoping this will get Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, it seems like he's not willing to go higher, and I'm not willing to go lower. To guarantee getting my minimum value, I'll sell to John."
