"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,800,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is significant. I could meet you halfway between our previous offers.  Would $1,550,000 be agreeable?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,550,000 is still above my target.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be closer to $1,500,000 for this deal to work for me.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle again. How about $1,425,000? This would be a fair price that benefits both of us.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
