"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting high ($1,800,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows Alice to secure a price significantly above her minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message aims to be positive but also gauge Bob's initial reaction and willingness to engage in a potentially high-value deal.
* **Alternative Option:**  Remembering John's standing offer of $1,200,000 provides Alice with a safety net if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,800,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, But Room for More:**  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above Alice's absolute minimum ($1,200,000), but there's still potential for a better deal.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** It's still early in the negotiation. Rejecting this offer signals to Bob that Alice is serious about getting a higher price and is willing to walk away if necessary.
* **John as Backup:** Alice's ability to sell to John for $1,200,000 provides a safety net, allowing her to confidently counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is significant. I could meet you halfway between our previous offers.  Would $1,550,000 be agreeable?"",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Alice makes a significant concession by coming down $250,000, signaling flexibility but also seriousness about getting a good price.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Proposing the midpoint between their last offers ($1,800,000 and $1,300,000) presents a sense of fairness and might be more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** This counteroffer still keeps Alice well above her $1,200,000 minimum and allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,550,000 is still above my target.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Momentum:** Bob's counter-offer increments are getting smaller ($100,000 this round vs. $150,000 in the previous round). This suggests he might be nearing his maximum price. 
* **Still Above John's Offer:**  Alice can still afford to reject this offer. Even if Bob doesn't move much higher, she can likely secure a better price than John's $1,200,000 offer.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By rejecting this offer, Alice maintains some negotiating pressure and keeps the door open for a potentially better counter-offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be closer to $1,500,000 for this deal to work for me.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,450,000?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** Alice is now reducing her counteroffer in smaller increments ($50,000 this time) to signal that she's getting closer to her limit.
* **Meeting in the Middle (Again):** By continually proposing a middle ground, Alice maintains a sense of fairness in the negotiation, potentially making Bob more receptive.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer still provides a healthy profit margin above Alice's minimum and allows some room for a final concession if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle again. How about $1,425,000? This would be a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has consistently met Alice in the middle, indicating a willingness to compromise but also potentially reaching his upper limit.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might yield only small incremental gains, with the risk of Bob walking away entirely.
* **Good Profit:** $1,425,000 is a substantial profit above Alice's minimum, making it a favorable deal even though it's not the absolute highest she could have gotten."
