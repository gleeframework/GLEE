Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $1,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a higher price gives room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, especially if it's in high demand or unique.  
* **Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so there's limited risk in starting high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have some leverage, like limited supply or that Bob needs the product sooner rather than later. If we know Bob is a very savvy negotiator or time is not on our side, a slightly lower initial offer might be more strategic."
