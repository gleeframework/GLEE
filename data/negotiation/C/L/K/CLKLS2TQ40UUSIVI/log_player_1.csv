I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  This gives Bob a good incentive to negotiate, but it's still a significant profit for me.  I'll be keeping an eye on the time and John's offer, and I'm ready to adjust my price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $1,050,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price considering his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $950,000 is a good deal.  It's only $50,000 less than John's offer, and it's worth it to avoid further negotiation and the risk of a counteroffer that could be even lower."
