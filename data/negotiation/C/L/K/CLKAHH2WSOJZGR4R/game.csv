"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $120. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit. However, $120 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we try $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $80 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money. I'll offer it to you for $140. This is my final counteroffer.",140.0,Alice,5,
