Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $120. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $80 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money. I'll offer it to you for $140. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $140.  It's unlikely she'll budge further, and we have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80. It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed deal."
