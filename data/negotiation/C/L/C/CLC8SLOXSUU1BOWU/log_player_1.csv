Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, we'll negotiate from there, but I'm confident the product is worth more than $1.5 million to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with my own. While $1,800,000 is a decent offer, I believe the product is worth more.  I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still confident that the product is worth this amount to Bob. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's agreeable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to counter again and try to squeeze out a bit more.  I'm willing to go down to $1,700,000, but I'm not going lower than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,700,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still confident that the product is worth this much to Bob.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable price, and it's clear that we're not going to agree.  Rather than continue a fruitless negotiation, I'll sell to John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and I'm confident I can find a better buyer for my product in the future."
