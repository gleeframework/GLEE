"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $22,000 is far beyond my budget of $8,000. There's no point in accepting it. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $18,000 is a slight improvement, it's still far too high for me. I'm sticking to my budget of $8,000 and will continue to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value to you, but $18,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. This shows I'm serious about purchasing, but I can't go higher."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. While $10,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to accept $14,000. This is a final offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Alice to see if I can get a better price or even secure a deal with John at $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us. If this doesn't work, I may need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 12000}
