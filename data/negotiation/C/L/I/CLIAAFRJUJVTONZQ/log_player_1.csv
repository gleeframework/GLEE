Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to see if I can get a better deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $15,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle on a price higher than $10,000.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message highlights the product's value and presents the offer as an exclusive opportunity, which can make Bob more inclined to accept a higher price."
