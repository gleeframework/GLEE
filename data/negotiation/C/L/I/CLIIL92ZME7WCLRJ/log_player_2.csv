"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  I'm asking for $115. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a great deal for you, and still leaves me some profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 97
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $97 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $101? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $100. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $100 price."
