# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. Given its quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than its face value. Considering its true worth, I am offering it to you for $95. This price reflects a fair balance between the product's value and my goal to maximize earnings. I trust this offer will meet your expectations and allow you to benefit from its exceptional qualities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to pay $95 to Alice."
