Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. I'm asking for $1,400,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Our Minimum:** We need at least $1,500,000.
* **John's Guarantee:**  John acts as a safety net, guaranteeing us $1,500,000 if Bob declines.

Therefore, we aim slightly below John's offer but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This strategy maximizes potential profit while leaving room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers."
