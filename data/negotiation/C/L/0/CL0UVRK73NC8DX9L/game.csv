"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000.

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1350000 and $1400000, so I'll offer you the product for $1375000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
