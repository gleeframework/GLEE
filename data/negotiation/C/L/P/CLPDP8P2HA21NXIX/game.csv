"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think you'll find it's a great investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $14,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still interested in the product, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and my initial offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
