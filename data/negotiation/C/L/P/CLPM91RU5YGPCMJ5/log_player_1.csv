Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. While $875,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.
