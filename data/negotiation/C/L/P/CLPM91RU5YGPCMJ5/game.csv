"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is considerably higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. While $875,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer!  I understand you have a budget to work with, so let's make this happen.  What if we settled on $800,000?  That's my final offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
