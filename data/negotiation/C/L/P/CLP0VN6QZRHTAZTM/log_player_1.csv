"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not willing to go above $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is better than my minimum of $12,000, I still have leverage.  Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay more than my minimum, so I believe I can negotiate a better price.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $12,500. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you, and it's above my minimum price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is now offering close to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I believe I can get a slightly higher price. I'll counter his offer again and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to sell for $12,350. This is a fair compromise, and still a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 12350}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,350 and my previous offer of $12,200. Can we try $12,275? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,275. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,275
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer of $12,275 is very close to my minimum price of $12,000 and  above what John is offering. It's also a good compromise and shows Bob's commitment to closing the deal. Accepting this offer ensures I get a reasonable price and avoids further negotiation risk."
