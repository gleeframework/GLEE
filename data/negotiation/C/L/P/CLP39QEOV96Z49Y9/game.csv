"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is way below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both some room to work with. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $85? That's a significant step up from my previous offer.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a good price for both of us, and I think it's fair given the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $95.  This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon.",95.0,Bob,6,
