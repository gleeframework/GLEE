"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This reflects the value I know it will bring to your operations.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,175,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. I think that's a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I believe $950,000 undervalues the product's potential. Let's find a compromise - I'm willing to accept $1,050,000.  This is a significant reduction on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal done.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
