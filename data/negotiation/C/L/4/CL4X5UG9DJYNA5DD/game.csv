"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll counteroffer at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $800,000 is the very highest I could go.  If that's workable for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, but I still need to make a profit. I'll consider your offer, but I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the returns it can bring. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
