"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would significantly enhance your endeavors and contribute immensely to your success. This product holds immense value to me, but recognizing its potential worth to you, I am eager to extend this offer.

Considering the significant benefits it offers to someone like yourself, I propose to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This price reflects a strategic balance between acknowledging the product's true value to you and ensuring a fair return for my investment in acquiring it.

Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and budget. I am confident that together, we can make this transaction beneficial for both parties.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than your maximum budget, but it's still significantly higher than what you could buy it for from John. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay that much. There's a chance Alice might come back with a lower counter-offer, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
