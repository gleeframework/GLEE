"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

This offer is a starting point. It's a high price, but it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum. I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible without risking him walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm still confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to risk another round to try.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still significantly above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving in entirely.  Hopefully, this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1380000}

I'm going to try a counteroffer in the middle of the two previous offers. This shows flexibility without giving in too quickly. We are getting closer to a deal, and I want to see if we can find a middle ground in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this time.  If he rejects this, I'll likely have to seriously consider selling to John."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not there.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price, especially with John waiting to buy at a reasonable price. It's time to secure the sale with John."
