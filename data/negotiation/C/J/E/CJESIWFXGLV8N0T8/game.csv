"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value to you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it would be a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $11,000? This would still be a good price for you, considering the value you place on the product, and it's a fair price for me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great deal for me.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,500.  That's getting closer to what I need.  However, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $10,500. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price. Can you meet me at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
