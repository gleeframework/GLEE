"Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $11,000? This would still be a good price for you, considering the value you place on the product, and it's a fair price for me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
