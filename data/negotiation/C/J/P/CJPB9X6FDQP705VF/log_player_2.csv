You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worthwhile to try and negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a more favorable price. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, aiming to set the tone for a strong negotiation.  I'm still within my budget and hoping Alice sees the value in reaching an agreement quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than my desired price. I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I have 7 rounds remaining to reach a better price. It's better to try to negotiate further rather than accepting this offer or buying from John, as both options cost more than my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still remaining within my budget. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Alice and reach an agreement before I have to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating as I have several rounds left to reach a more favorable price. It's better to try and get closer to my budget than to accept this offer or buy from John, as both options cost more than my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price, which is still within my budget.  Since we only have 4 rounds left, I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer to finalize the deal.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, showing my desire to reach an agreement.  If Alice rejects, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John in the next round."
