"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is closer, but still outside my budget.  Would you consider $720,000? I feel that's a fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 720000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to feel that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $720,000. I'll come down to $810,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below your backup price of $800,000. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price than risk Alice not budging further."
