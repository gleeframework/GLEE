"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is closer, but still outside my budget.  Would you consider $720,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to feel that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $720,000. I'll come down to $810,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",810000.0,Alice,5,
