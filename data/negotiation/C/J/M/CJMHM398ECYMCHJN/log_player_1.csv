Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of it. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $925,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. We know the product is worth significantly more to him, and we have a backup offer from John.  We should counter-offer to keep the negotiation moving."

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. This product has the potential to bring you substantial returns, which I'm sure you understand. I'm willing to come down slightly to $880,000. This offer represents a fair compromise and reflects the product's worth."",

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this offers a reasonable compromise and allows us to move forward with the transaction.

While we could push for a bit more, Bob is now getting close to our minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate risks him walking away. Accepting $850,000 ensures a significant profit above our fallback option of selling to John."
