"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'll sell it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum price of $1,200,000. However, you know you have another option with John. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed to buy from John at your maximum budget."
