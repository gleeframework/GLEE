"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is quite a bit over my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $11,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this point.",11000.0,Bob,4,
