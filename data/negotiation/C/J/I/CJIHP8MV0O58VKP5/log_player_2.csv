"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $1,100,000. You should counteroffer Alice to try and get a better price, potentially closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price, but still higher than John's offer. This leaves room for negotiation while also signaling that I'm serious about getting the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than John's price, and there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, I can try to push her lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price is getting closer to John's price. This counteroffer is a compromise - it's still lower than her offer, but higher than John's, showing that I'm willing to pay a bit more for the product from Alice if she'll meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than John's price, and it seems we're stuck in a stalemate. It's better to cut our losses and go with John's guaranteed lower price, especially since Alice's counteroffers seem to be going up rather than down."
