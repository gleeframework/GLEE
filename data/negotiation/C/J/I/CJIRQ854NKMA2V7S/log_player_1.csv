Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Aiming for Above Value:** The goal is to maximize profit. Offering it slightly below your minimum ($15,000) wouldn't make sense.
* **Leaving Negotiation Space:** While the offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he's interested. If he outright rejects it, you can always counter-offer or proceed with John."
