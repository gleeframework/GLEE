"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a reasonable starting point that is still within my budget, and it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. I believe Alice will likely accept this offer as it's still a good deal for her, considering her desired price of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,800 is closer to my budget, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially since Alice rejected my counteroffer.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,200. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still sticking to my budget. I believe this price is fair, as it's closer to my budget and still offers a good profit margin for Alice.  Hopefully, this counteroffer will be accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice is showing no sign of budging from her price.  I've already made two counteroffers, and she's rejected them both.  At this point, I'm starting to run out of time and I'm concerned that I might not be able to get a price within my budget.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the safe option of buying from John.  While $10,000 is not my ideal price, it's within my budget and I can guarantee the deal."
