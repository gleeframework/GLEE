"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this truly unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin discussions.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get from this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like to start with this number.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is below my acceptable range considering the true value and potential of this product. Let's meet halfway - how about $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get from this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to understand the significant value this product offers.  $1,075,000 is still too far off for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,110,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe it's more than fair considering what you'll be gaining.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,110,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. My counteroffer is $1,080,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
