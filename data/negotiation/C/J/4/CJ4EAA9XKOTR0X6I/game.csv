"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it offers.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair deal considering the immense value it holds.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, and I do too. However, the price gap is still substantial for me.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant move on my part, demonstrating my serious interest.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is closer to a fair price, I'm still seeking a figure that reflects the product's true worth. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I propose $950,000. This demonstrates my flexibility while ensuring a reasonable deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. I appreciate you coming down, but  $950,000 is really pushing my budget.  To be completely transparent, I do have another offer at a significantly lower price.  If you could do $800,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'll have to seriously consider the other offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
