Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the market value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product looks great, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $11,000,  $10,500 is still a good deal and it's getting late in the negotiation. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and ending up with only $8,000 from John."
