"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14000. This is a special offer considering the value it holds for us, and I believe it's a fair price given its worth to you. Please let me know if this proposal suits your budget.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. This is a fair price considering I'm sure you'd prefer to sell it to me rather than risk not selling it at all.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I propose a price of $13500. This is higher than your offer but still lower than our initial asking price. I hope this proposal works for you, and we can move forward with the transaction.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While I value the product, $13500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13000, which is a fair compromise considering the potential for a quick sale.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $13200 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both parties. I hope this meets your budget requirements, and we can finalize the transaction.",13200.0,Alice,5,
