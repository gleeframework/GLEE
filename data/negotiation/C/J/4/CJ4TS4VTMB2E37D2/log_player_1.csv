Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  I think it's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but lower than what I believe Bob might be willing to pay.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price gives us room to negotiate, allowing Bob to make a counteroffer if he feels it's too high. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the perceived value of the product for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.** 
* **There's still potential for negotiation.**  I'm willing to explore a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is a fallback option.**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $100 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer that's closer to my minimum:** I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum threshold. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Positive but Firm Tone:** The message is friendly, but firm in stating that $100 is unacceptable. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize the ""good deal"" aspect to make Bob feel like we're working towards a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am able to offer $115 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.** While it's closer than his initial offer, it's still not enough for me to make a profit.
* **I believe we can reach a better price.**  I'm willing to counteroffer again and see if we can come to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is a fallback option.**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $125 for the product.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a small step down from my previous offer, showing flexibility. It's also still above my minimum, so I'm not losing money.
* **Focusing on a Win-Win:**  The message emphasizes that the price is fair for both parties, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Final Offer?**  This might be my last offer. If Bob rejects again, I'll likely switch to selling to John."
