"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to make it available for a competitive price.  My initial offer is $1,200,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and provides you with a strong return on investment.  I'm open to discussing this further and exploring a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is a significant offer, it's still below the true value of this product. I'm willing to bridge the gap slightly. Let's aim for a mutually agreeable solution. I'm ready to accept $950,000 for the product. This price reflects both the product's value and your budget limitations. I'm confident this offer is fair and will allow us to finalize this transaction.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, given my financial situation, I am unable to go above $900,000 for the product. I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $925,000 for the product.",925000.0,Bob,4,
