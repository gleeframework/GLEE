"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get a better price. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
