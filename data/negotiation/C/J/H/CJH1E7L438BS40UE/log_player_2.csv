"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I've done some research and I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to try and get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price, and risking the deal to try and shave off another $50,000 isn't worth it."
