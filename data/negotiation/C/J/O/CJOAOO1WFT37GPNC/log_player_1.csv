"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common strategy to see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject it and counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit. I'll reject and counteroffer again, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm  lowering my price again, but only slightly. This shows that I'm still interested in selling to Bob, but I'm not willing to give in to his low offer.  I'm hoping that he will be willing to meet me in the middle."
