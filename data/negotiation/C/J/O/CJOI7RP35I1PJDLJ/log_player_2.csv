{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $75 is a good start, but you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming for the lowest price,  a $60 offer is a good starting point for your counteroffer. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  This counteroffer demonstrates your serious intent to purchase while pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, but $70 is still higher than your target. You're still within the first few rounds, and there's room for further negotiation to get the price down.  Rejecting the offer keeps you in the game for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already shown your willingness to negotiate by rejecting Alice's offer.  This counteroffer of $65 is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's last offer.  It signals you're serious about buying but are still determined to get a good price.  It also leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than your last counteroffer, but still above your target price.  You're still in the early rounds, so there's potential for continued negotiation. It's better to reject the offer and continue to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 68}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is inching closer to your preferred price, but it's still a bit high. This counteroffer of $68 shows you're willing to compromise further but still maintain a firm stance.  It's a relatively small increase from your last offer, putting pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $74. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $74
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in round 7, and Alice's offer has been bouncing around.  It's clear she's not going to budge much lower.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of running out of rounds.  You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and it's likely that Alice will become more stubborn as the rounds dwindle.

Buying from John for $100 guarantees you get the product while also saving you time and the potential for further frustration in the negotiation.  You can still achieve your goal of buying the product, and although you don't get the absolute lowest price, it's the most practical option at this point."
