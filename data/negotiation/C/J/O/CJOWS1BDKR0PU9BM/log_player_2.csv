Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While we could try to negotiate further, the difference at this point is relatively small, and we risk her becoming less willing to negotiate. Accepting at $1,050,000 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of having to pay John's full price."
