"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you acknowledging my budget and coming in at $1,400,000.  While I'm interested in the product, that's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
