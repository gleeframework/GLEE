"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. This gives you a significant saving compared to its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
