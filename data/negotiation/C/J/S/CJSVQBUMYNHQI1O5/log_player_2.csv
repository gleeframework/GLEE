"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your target price of $1,500,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You know Alice is willing to sell for at least $1,200,000.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** You should only buy from John if you can't get a better price from Alice. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round. A good starting point would be somewhere between her offer of $1,300,000 and your maximum price of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant reduction:** This shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and creates a space for further bargaining.
* **Stay within your budget:**  $1,250,000 is still within your maximum price of $1,500,000.
* **Leave room for compromise:** You're still willing to pay more than Alice's minimum of $1,200,000, indicating a potential deal is possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** It's above your target price and only slightly lower than her initial offer. 
* **You have more leverage.** Alice is already showing a willingness to negotiate, and there's still time to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** There's no guarantee that Alice will keep increasing her offer, so trying to negotiate further is a better strategy.

**Next Steps:**

You need to make another counteroffer to Alice in the next round. Aim for a price closer to your desired price point, but leave room for further compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,275,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase your offer slightly:** This shows you're willing to compromise but still pushing for a lower price.
* **Stay within your budget:**  $1,275,000 is still comfortably within your maximum price of $1,500,000.
* **Bridge the gap:** This offer is closer to Alice's last offer and might encourage her to accept.

**Next Steps:**

Wait for Alice's response. If she rejects this offer, consider slightly increasing your offer again, but be prepared to either walk away or buy from John if you can't reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's closer to your maximum price and doesn't reflect a real attempt to meet you halfway.
* **You're losing leverage.** Alice has been increasing her offer, indicating she's unwilling to budge much further.
* **Buying from John is still a viable option.** You're approaching your limit, but John's offer is still on the table.

**Next Steps:**

You need to make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round. Be more aggressive with your offer, aiming for a price that is closer to your desired price point but still leaves room for compromise. Consider a price that is slightly above her last offer. If she continues to increase her offers, you may need to seriously consider buying from John to avoid overspending."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,325,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **More aggressive counteroffer:**  This offer is closer to your target price and demonstrates your willingness to negotiate.
* **Stay within your budget:** $1,325,000 is still comfortably within your maximum price of $1,500,000.
* **Challenge Alice's stance:** This counteroffer signals that you're not willing to accept her increasing offers and are pushing for a more reasonable price.

**Next Steps:**

If Alice rejects this offer, carefully evaluate the situation:

* **Is she willing to compromise?** If her next offer is still significantly higher, consider buying from John.
* **Are you willing to pay more?** If her offer is only slightly higher, you might be willing to accept it to secure the deal. 

It's time to decide whether you're willing to risk further rounds of negotiation or take a more decisive action."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too close to your maximum.** With only 3 rounds remaining, there's not much room for further negotiation.
* **The risk of overspending is high.** Alice is consistently raising her offer, and there's a strong chance she'll keep doing so.
* **John's offer is a safe alternative.**  It's within your budget and guarantees you'll get the product without the risk of further negotiation. 

**Conclusion:**

Buying from John is the safest option in this scenario. It avoids the potential of overspending with Alice and secures the product within your budget. While you might be able to get a slightly lower price from Alice, the risk of her increasing her offer and exceeding your budget is too high."
