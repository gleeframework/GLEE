We've reached a point where the negotiation is getting tiresome, and Bob's offers are not getting much closer to my desired price.  I'm not sure if he's going to move up much more, and I've only got 4 rounds left. To ensure I don't lose out on the chance to sell at a decent price, I'm going to sell to John for $120."
