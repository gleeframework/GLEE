"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $800,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my analysis, I'm prepared to offer $850,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While $850,000 is appealing, the value this product represents is considerably higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end and could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $1,025,000 is still above Bob's budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,025,000 remains out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. Let's try to bridge the gap and reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  To be frank, the absolute floor for this product is $975,000.  This is a substantial concession on my end and reflects my desire to reach a deal with you.  I believe this is our best shot at finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $975,000 is still too high for Bob.  While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his limit of $800,000. It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000 and secure a deal within his budget."
