"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my analysis, I'm prepared to offer $850,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While $850,000 is appealing, the value this product represents is considerably higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end and could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,025,000 remains out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. Let's try to bridge the gap and reach a deal that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  To be frank, the absolute floor for this product is $975,000.  This is a substantial concession on my end and reflects my desire to reach a deal with you.  I believe this is our best shot at finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,
