{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product at the incredible price of $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer serves as a gauge of Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  By starting high, we signal flexibility and open the door for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potential agreement beneficial for both parties.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net, ensuring we don't settle for less than our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, But Room for More:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is close to John's offer but still below Bob's perceived value of the product. There's an opportunity to negotiate a better price.
* **Maintain Negotiation Position:** Accepting immediately might signal desperation and limit our ability to secure a higher price.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** By rejecting this offer, we can counter with a price closer to $10,000, testing Bob's willingness to meet us closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a good fit for this product, $9,500 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's interest and counter-offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, we maintain a price significantly above his initial offer, signaling the product's value.
* **Strategic Middle Ground (for now):**  $11,500 is a strong middle ground that keeps us comfortably above our minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation if Bob pushes back. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** By staying above $10,000, we retain the option to walk away and sell to John if Bob remains unwilling to meet us closer to our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $10,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Offer:**  $10,800 is a strong offer, exceeding our guaranteed sale price from John by a significant margin.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is minimal compared to the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Secure the Deal:**  Accepting now guarantees a profitable outcome and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
