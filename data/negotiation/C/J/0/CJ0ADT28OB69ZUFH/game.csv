"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $80? I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $110? It's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to go up to $95, though.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we compromise at $105? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
