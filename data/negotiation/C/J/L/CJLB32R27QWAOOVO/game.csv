"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth $1,200,000 to you, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is still a great price considering its worth $1,200,000 to you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,320,000. This is still a great price considering its worth $1,200,000 to you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
