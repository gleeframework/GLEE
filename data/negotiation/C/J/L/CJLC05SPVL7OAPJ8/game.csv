"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, I believe the product's true value sits closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm getting close to considering the offer from John, who is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. I'd like to reach an agreement with you before exploring other options. What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Bob,4,
