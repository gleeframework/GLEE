Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more reasonable agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope you can consider this offer.

I'm going to try to get a better price than $950,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer."

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the same as what John is offering. Since I want to maximize my profit, and there's no guarantee that I'll get more in future rounds with Bob, I'll accept Bob's offer."
