It's not worth buying the product from Alice for $16,500 when you can get it from John for $15,000. Rejecting her offer allows you to try to get a better price from Alice."

Alice is getting closer to my maximum price, but it's still not worth it to buy from her. It's better to go with John and get the product for $15,000, which is my maximum price."
