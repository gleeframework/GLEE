"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is significantly lower than what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering its value. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,250,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $1,250,000, but that's simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,500,000, which is the minimum I can accept. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,500,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a price that fits within my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000 for the product. This price is fair considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
