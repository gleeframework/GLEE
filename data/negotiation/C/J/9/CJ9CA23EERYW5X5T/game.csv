"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $14500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",14500.0,Bob,4,
