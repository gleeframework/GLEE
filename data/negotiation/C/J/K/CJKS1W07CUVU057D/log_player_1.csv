Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's likely to be attractive to Bob since it's below his perceived value of the product ($1,500,000). This strategy aims to:

* **Start strong:**  A high initial offer establishes a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Leave room for compromise:** Bob can likely find room for a counteroffer without feeling he's getting a bad deal.
* **Avoid quick sale:**  A higher price reduces the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and you having to settle for the lower offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I want to see if I can squeeze out a better price.  Rejecting his offer gives me the chance to counter with a number closer to my initial proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still remaining above Bob's offer. This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not immediately accepting a significantly lower price, showing I'm not desperate for a sale.
* **Explore further negotiation:**  It's a reasonable offer that might prompt Bob to counter again, potentially leading to a price closer to my desired range.
* **Minimize risk:**  While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly higher than John's offer, reducing the risk of losing out on a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only slightly above John's offer of $1,200,000.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation is too high.  The possibility of a counteroffer leading to a lower price or a stalemate that forces me to accept John's offer is too great. It's best to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John and avoid further risk."
