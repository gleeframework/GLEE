Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm setting the price at $18,000. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 18000 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, I can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  While I don't want to reveal my minimum price, I'm hinting at the product's value with the phrase ""given its value"". This might make the price seem more reasonable to Bob. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning that I'm offering it to him before a public listing creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing him to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob's personality and negotiating style, you might choose a different approach."
