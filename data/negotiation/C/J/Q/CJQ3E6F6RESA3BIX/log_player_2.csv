Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: After careful consideration, I am willing to sell the product to you at $12,650. This is a final offer, as it closely aligns with the value you place on the product, while also being a fair price for me. I hope we can agree upon this price to conclude our negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,650. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. He has one round left with Alice, and while Alice's offer is closer to his target, it's still above his maximum budget.  There is no guarantee that Alice will accept a counteroffer, and it's better to secure the product from John at his desired price rather than risk missing out on it."
