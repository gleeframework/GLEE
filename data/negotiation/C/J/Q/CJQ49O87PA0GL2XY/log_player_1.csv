"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high, at $1,200,000, because I know the product is worth more to me than to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and straightforward, emphasizing the value to me and highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit. By starting high and being willing to negotiate, I hope to reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000).  If Bob rejects this initial offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation with him or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm going to hold out for a better deal.

**Strategy:**

I have 10 rounds, and I know I can get $1,000,000 from John.  I'm going to use these rounds to try to squeeze more money out of Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to $1,000,000, and see if I can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, considering the value of the product. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging his offer and suggesting a compromise while reminding him of the product's worth.

**Strategy:**

I'm using a combination of firmness and compromise. I'm not accepting his initial offer, but I'm also showing flexibility. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal outcome while keeping in mind the limited number of rounds and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000. This seems to be closer to the midpoint of our previous offers, and I believe it would be beneficial for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable value. This is a good outcome considering I can also sell to John for the same price. Accepting Bob's offer saves me time and effort involved in further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

While I could potentially try to push for a higher price, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a profitable sale quickly and confidently."
