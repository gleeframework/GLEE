Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a better price.  Rejecting Alice's initial offer allows you to explore if there's room for a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected.  It shows you're serious about buying the product, but you're also looking for a good deal.  This strategy leaves room for negotiation and hopefully leads to a price within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $750000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than the price I'm aiming for. There are still rounds available to negotiate, and I want to try to get closer to my desired price point of $750,000.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about purchasing the product while still trying to close the gap between our desired prices.  It's a reasonable increase from my previous offer and hopefully, will encourage Alice to come down a bit more."
