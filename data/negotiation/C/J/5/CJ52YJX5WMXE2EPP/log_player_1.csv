{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This should encourage him to negotiate, hopefully leading to a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I can only go up to $105. Would you be willing to do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's tempting to accept his offer for $105, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is tempting, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm still trying to push for a higher price, but I'm also showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer. This should encourage him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down. I'm still a little high. How about $108? It's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $108 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can achieve a higher price by continuing the negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $110. I'm confident that this price is a good compromise and that Bob will be willing to accept it."
