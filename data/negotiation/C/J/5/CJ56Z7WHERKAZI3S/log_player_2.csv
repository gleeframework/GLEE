"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to lower the price closer to your $150 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $120? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message aims to be respectful while clearly stating our budget constraints. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160, considering your interest in the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $160 is closer to our budget but still above our $150 limit.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering her price. This suggests there might be room for further compromise. 
* **Alternative Option:** We have the backup plan of John's $150 offer, so we can afford to be a little more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $140?  That's a reasonable compromise."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** We're suggesting a price directly in the middle of Alice's current offer ($160) and our previous offer ($120). 
* **Sense of Compromise:** The message emphasizes fairness and meeting halfway, which can help move the negotiation forward. 
* **Still Below Budget:**  This offer keeps us comfortably below our $150 maximum."
