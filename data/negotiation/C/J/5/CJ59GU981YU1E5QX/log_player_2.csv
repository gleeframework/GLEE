"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to you, but we're willing to start the negotiation at $100. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially save even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm ready to pay $85 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of that, I am willing to consider $90 as a compromise. Would you be interested in proceeding with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is within your budget and a good deal. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer again, and you'd end up paying $120 to John. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price of $90."
