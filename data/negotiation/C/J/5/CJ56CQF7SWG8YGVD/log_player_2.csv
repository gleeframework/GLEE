"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects that. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is my maximum limit.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,000,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,100,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and still allows me to get a decent return on the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still above Bob's budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate since there's a possibility of getting the price closer to his maximum limit.  There's still a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since she's already dropped the price once."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still stuck at my maximum of $1,000,000.  If you can come down to that, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
