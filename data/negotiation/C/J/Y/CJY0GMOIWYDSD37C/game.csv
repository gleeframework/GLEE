"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you and the price I'm willing to accept.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,262,500 for the product. This is a fair price that accounts for both our needs and helps us reach a deal. What do you say?",1262500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,262,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,270,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product holds for you and my minimum acceptable price.",1270000.0,Alice,5,
