"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,262,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,270,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,270,000 is very close to your desired price point, and it's likely that she won't go lower.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice becoming less willing to sell or you might reach a stalemate. Accepting the offer guarantees you get the product at a price that's still significantly lower than what John is offering."
