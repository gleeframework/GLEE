{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**  Alice's offer is way above your budget. You should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50} 
```

**Explanation:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get close to my budget, but I want to leave room to increase the offer if needed."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:** Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a lower price. I have enough rounds left that I can continue to negotiate without resorting to John's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}

**Explanation:** I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it well below my maximum budget and below Alice's most recent offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:** Alice's offer is still too high, though it is getting closer to my budget. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a lower price. With 6 rounds remaining, I can still afford to be patient and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Explanation:**  I'm making a counteroffer at my maximum budget. It's a risky move since I'm at my limit, but if Alice accepts, I get the product at my desired price. If she rejects, I can go to John and still get the product for the same price. This is a gamble, but it's the best way to potentially get the product for less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:** Alice's offer is still above my budget, and with only 3 rounds left, there's not enough time to negotiate further.  I'm going to buy the product from John, which ensures I get it for my maximum price.  While I might have been able to get it cheaper from Alice if I had more time, it's not worth risking it."
