Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $95?  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
