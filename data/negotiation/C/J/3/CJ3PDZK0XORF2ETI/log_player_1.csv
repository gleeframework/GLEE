"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to counteroffer and allowing for a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for profit:**  Bob's offer is above my minimum, but there's still room for me to get closer to my desired price.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price. 
* **Risk Management:**  While selling to John is a guaranteed $10,000,  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $12,250?  It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reframing the Offer:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair price"" aspect, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and create a feeling of a win-win situation. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  My counteroffer still ensures I make a profit that's above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer is very close to my desired price.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I could try to get $12,250, there's a chance Bob could reject that, and I might end up losing the deal.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain of a slightly higher price isn't worth the risk of losing the sale completely.  

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good profit while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
