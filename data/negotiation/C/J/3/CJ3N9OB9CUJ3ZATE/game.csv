"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $150 by me due to its unique features and quality. Considering its worth to you might be around $100, I'm willing to negotiate a deal that benefits both of us. Would you like to explore a compromise, perhaps at a price higher than what you're considering but still within a reasonable range for you?",125.0,Alice,1,
