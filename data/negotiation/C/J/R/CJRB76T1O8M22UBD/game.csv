"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $130, I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",135.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to my bottom line.  $132 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle on $134? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",134.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $134. Would you be willing to meet me at $131? I'm willing to make a small sacrifice to get the product, but I need to stay within my budget",131.0,Bob,6,
