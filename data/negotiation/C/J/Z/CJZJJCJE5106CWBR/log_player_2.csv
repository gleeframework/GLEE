"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $800,000 is very attractive, but I have room to negotiate and potentially save more money. I want to see if I can get a better price before jumping at this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, I'm not quite ready to commit to $800,000. I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000 for this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is closer to my target, I still have room for negotiation. It's worth exploring whether I can get closer to my desired price of $700,000 before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $800,000. This price is fair to both of us and ensures a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $800,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. While I'd prefer to pay less, I've already rejected a few offers and we're getting close to the midpoint of our price ranges.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get me a significantly better price, and I risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price without risking a further price increase."
