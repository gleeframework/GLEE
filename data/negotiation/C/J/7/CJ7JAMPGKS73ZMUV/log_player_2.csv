Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,300. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800, but that's my final offer. It's a great compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $9,800.  She's drawn a line in the sand and called it her final offer.  At this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation, as she might not budge and you'll end up paying more than John's price. Cutting your losses and buying from John for $10,000 is the most logical choice."
