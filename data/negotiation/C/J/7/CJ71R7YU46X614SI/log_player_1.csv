"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good price for both of us, and I'm confident the product will be worth more than that to you. Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about we try $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating, and $10,000 is closer to what I'm looking for.  However, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  How about $11,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth more than that in the long run. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but no higher. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my minimum of $15,000, $10,500 is still a decent price. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
