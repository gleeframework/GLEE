"Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but could only go as high as $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $800,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to make this a worthwhile deal for both of us. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I could potentially do $900,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
