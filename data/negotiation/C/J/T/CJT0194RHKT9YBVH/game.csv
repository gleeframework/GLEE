"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to accept $13,000?  That's a significant price jump from my last offer, and I think it's a fair deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000 yet. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $14,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer of $18,000.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. $14,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more affordable.  How about $13,500? That's a reasonable compromise, and it would allow me to make this purchase.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $13,500 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $14,000? It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise considering the value of the product to you.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $13,750. I believe that's a fair price and reflects the compromises we've both made. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",13750.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept just yet. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $14,250. It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise considering the value of the product to you. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",14250.0,Alice,9,
