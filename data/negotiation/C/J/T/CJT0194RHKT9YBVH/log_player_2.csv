Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. Can you consider that price?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000 yet. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.

It's time to cut bait with Alice.  She's clearly more focused on getting as close to her desired price as possible and is unlikely to agree to anything near $10,000. You have a guaranteed option with John, and waiting another round with Alice carries the risk of ending up with no deal at all."
