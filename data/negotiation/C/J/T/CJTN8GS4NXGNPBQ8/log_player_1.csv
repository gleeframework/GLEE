"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit far off from what I need. How about $10,500? That's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,250? That's the best I can do. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,250 is getting close to my desired range and is significantly better than selling to John for $15,000. I want to avoid losing the potential for a good deal with Bob."
