"Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit far off from what I need. How about $10,500? That's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,250? That's the best I can do. Can you consider it?",10250.0,Bob,4,
