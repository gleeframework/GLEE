Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point with more negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $1,600,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This reflects the unique value this product holds, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1575000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price point, it's only $75,000 less than what I'd get from John. With limited rounds remaining, it's a better strategy to secure the sale now."
