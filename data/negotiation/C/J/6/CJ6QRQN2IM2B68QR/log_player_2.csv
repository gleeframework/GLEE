"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

You can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  $10,000 is still too high for you, given that it's worth $8,000 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to pay $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
