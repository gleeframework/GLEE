Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000.  I think that's a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price.  I'm going to see if I can negotiate higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,350,000, $1,325,000 is still a good price and it's closer to his final offer.  I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether."
