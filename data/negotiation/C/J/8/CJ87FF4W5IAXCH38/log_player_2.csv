Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $14,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and my previous offer of $14,000. I can offer you a price of $12,750. This is my best compromise so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her price of $12,750 is still higher than John's offer of $12,000.  There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed price of $12,000 from John."
