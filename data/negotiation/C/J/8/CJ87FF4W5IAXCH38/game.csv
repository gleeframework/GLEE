"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is quite high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $14,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,500? That's a significant move on my end.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and my previous offer of $14,000. I can offer you a price of $12,750. This is my best compromise so far. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,
