Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $11,000, Bob. But I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $11,250? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $11,250 secures a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 price."
