{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging to create a good impression.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being rigid, suggesting that I'm open to discussion and compromise. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to pay close to my asking price.
* **Test the waters:**  Bob's response will give me valuable information about his willingness to pay. 
* **Leave room to negotiate:** I can adjust my price if necessary without risking a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  While I'm happy to sell at $8,000, I want to see if I can get more. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I might be able to nudge him up slightly.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and shows I'm not desperate to sell.

By rejecting the offer, I can:

* **Try to get a higher price:** I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial asking price of $10,000. 
* **Test Bob's commitment:** His willingness to counteroffer suggests he's committed to buying the product. 
* **Maintain my position:**  Rejecting the initial offer shows I'm not afraid to walk away if I don't get a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work. This is a fantastic product, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:** I reiterate the product's quality to remind Bob of its worth and justify the higher price.
* **Positive tone:** I remain positive and encouraging to keep the conversation going.

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a better deal:** $9,000 is still higher than my minimum and closer to my initial goal.
* **Show flexibility:**  Demonstrating I'm willing to negotiate increases the likelihood of a deal.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting his initial offer, I show that I'm not under pressure to sell immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $500 less than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **High chance of deal:**  He's clearly interested and has shown a willingness to compromise. 
* **Potential for better offer is low:**  At this point, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly higher offer from Bob.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer risks him walking away, and then I'd be forced to sell to John at my minimum.

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Secure a sale:** It guarantees I sell the product and make a profit.
* **Minimize risk:** It prevents me from potentially losing the deal with Bob.
* **Move on:** I can focus on other opportunities knowing I've secured a good price."
