"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to get the price down a bit closer to $10,000.  How about $10,500? I'm really interested in the product, and this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible.  While $11,000 is closer to his target, he can likely get it lower. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a price closer to his desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a fair price, and I'm committed to finding a deal.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $10,750? This would be a significant saving for me, and I believe it's still a good price for you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $10,750 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,875? I'm confident that this price would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been successfully negotiating with Alice, and $10,875 is a good deal for him.  It's significantly lower than John's price, and it's close to his target of $10,000.  Further negotiation may be possible, but there's a risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds. Accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids potentially losing the opportunity."
