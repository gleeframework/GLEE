"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be a great asset to your business. I've priced it at $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair value given its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value this product brings, $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will still be a profitable acquisition for you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and provides a fair margin for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$900,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob by continuing to negotiate. It's a fair price for both of us and ensures I get a good return on the product."
