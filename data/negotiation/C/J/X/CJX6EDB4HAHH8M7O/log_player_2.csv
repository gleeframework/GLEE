"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be a great asset to your business. I've priced it at $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair value given its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's value to you. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so you can try to get a better price without risking losing the opportunity entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value this product brings, $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above the product's value to her. This shows I'm serious about buying but also trying to get a good deal.
* **Room for compromise:**  This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation.  I'm willing to go higher if necessary, but I'm aiming for a price closer to the product's true value. 
* **Building rapport:** The message is friendly but firm, aiming to keep the negotiation positive while demonstrating my position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will still be a profitable acquisition for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $950,000 is still significantly above my target price. I'm aiming to get a price closer to $850,000.
* **Room for further negotiation:** We have 7 rounds left, giving me time to continue pushing for a better deal.  There's likely still room for compromise.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** I'm not yet willing to pay John's price, which is significantly higher than what I believe this product is worth to me."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and provides a fair margin for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that is exactly halfway between my previous counteroffer ($850,000) and Alice's current offer ($950,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm highlighting that this price benefits both of us,  leaving room for a reasonable profit for Alice while still saving me money.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm suggesting we finalize the transaction to create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to accept."
