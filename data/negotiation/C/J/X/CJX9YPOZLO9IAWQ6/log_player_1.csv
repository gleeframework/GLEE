I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'll keep in mind John's offer as a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still hoping to get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. This offer is still above my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully lead to a quick sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

Bob's offer is only $1,000 less than my initial offer, and significantly higher than John's offer.  It's a good deal and I'm happy to close the deal."
