Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John at $150, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $149 leaves a small window open for Bob to negotiate (though unlikely given his valuation). 
* **Close to Bob's Maximum:**  It's improbable Bob would pay close to $150 knowing the product is only worth $80 to him. 

It's important to note that Bob is very unlikely to accept this offer. However, it's the best strategy to potentially maximize your profit before resorting to the guaranteed sale with John."
