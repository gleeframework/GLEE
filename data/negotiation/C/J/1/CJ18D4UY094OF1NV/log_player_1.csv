Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows for some back and forth if Bob wants to negotiate.
* **Ensure a Profit:**  The price is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($120), guaranteeing a profit. 

By starting high but not unreasonably so, I increase my chances of securing a deal with Bob at a price that benefits both of us."
