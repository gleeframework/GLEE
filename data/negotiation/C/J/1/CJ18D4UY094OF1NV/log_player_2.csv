"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $140 is less than your $150 maximum and saves you money compared to buying from John."
