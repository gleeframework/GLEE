"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, and it's a better deal than buying from John for $15,000."
