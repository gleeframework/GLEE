{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a price closer to $15,000, but I'm willing to go down to John's offer of $10,000 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm willing to come down a bit, $11,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $11,500 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John."
