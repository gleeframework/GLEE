Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a lot to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $900,000 leaves room for negotiation while still getting closer to my desired value.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:**  Emphasizing the value to Bob positions the offer as a win-win.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  The message indicates flexibility and invites Bob to engage in further discussion. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's response:**  If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter.
* **John's potential:** I'll keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall or if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really want to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, and even below my initial offer of $900,000. Accepting would leave me with a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown a willingness to negotiate and compromise. There's still potential to reach a more favorable price by counter-offering.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob ultimately fail.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-offer to Bob:** I will send a counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I need to find a balance between being firm on my minimum and being flexible enough to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, and I'm prepared to offer you the product for $850,000. This price still allows for a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I need to receive. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Strong position:** $850,000 is still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Motivational language:**  The message emphasizes the value to Bob and frames the offer as a win-win.
* **Closing pressure:**  I'm expressing a desire to ""close the deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's next move:
    * **Acceptance:** Great!
    * **Rejection:** I'll need to determine if another counteroffer is worth it, or if John's offer is the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit too low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $800,000. This is the highest I can go, but I really hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  $800,000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. Any lower, and I'm better off selling to John.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to counter-offer might drag out the process and risk losing Bob's interest altogether.
* **Opportunity cost:**  If I reject, there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer further. I could end up with nothing while John is waiting.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalize the deal:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and move forward with the transaction."
