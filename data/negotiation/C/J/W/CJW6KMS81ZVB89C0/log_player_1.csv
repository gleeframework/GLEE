"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value, aiming to maximize profit. I'll see if Bob is willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to offer a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is going lower, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to offer a price closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting too low, and we are already halfway through the rounds. There's a risk of him continuing to lower his offer, and I might end up with less than my minimum. It's safer to sell to John now, even though I'll get my minimum price."
