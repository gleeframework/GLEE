"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just a little too low for me. How about $95?  That's a fair compromise and it still leaves us both happy.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 was a bit too low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $92 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $94? That's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids me having to sell to someone else.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but $94 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $94, which would be $87. Would you be willing to consider that?",87.0,Bob,6,
