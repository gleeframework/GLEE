"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $8,500? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $8,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,200. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to get the best price, but $9,200 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is my previous best offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
