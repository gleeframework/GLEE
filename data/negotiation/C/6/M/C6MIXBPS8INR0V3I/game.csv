"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about $900,000?  This price still leaves room for you to make a profit and it's a more fair reflection of the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still too much for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and avoids the need to negotiate further.  What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $950,000 to show you I'm serious about making a deal. This is a very fair offer, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal now.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise and ensures both of us can walk away happy. I'm confident this is the final price we need to agree on.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $875,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to see $925,000 for this deal to work.  This leaves room for both of us to be happy.  Let's finalize this transaction now.",925000.0,Alice,7,
