"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's a good start, but Alice is being too aggressive with her initial offer.  There's room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to pay that much right away.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about $900,000?  This price still leaves room for you to make a profit and it's a more fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $950,000 to show you I'm serious about making a deal. This is a very fair offer, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal now.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $875,000 is still too far below my minimum.
