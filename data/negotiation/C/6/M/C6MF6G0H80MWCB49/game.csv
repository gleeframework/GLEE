"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $8,500. This is my final offer for now.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $8,000, Bob. However, I was thinking that since we're so close, I could stretch a bit further. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is my last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",8200.0,Alice,5,
