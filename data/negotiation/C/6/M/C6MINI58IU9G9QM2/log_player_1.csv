Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will be a highly profitable investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still ensuring Alice makes a significant profit over John's offer.
* **Create Urgency:**  By calling it an ""exclusive opportunity"" and emphasizing ""highly profitable investment,"" Alice subtly encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  Alice could start higher and be willing to negotiate down, or she could offer a ""take it or leave it"" price. The best approach depends on Alice's assessment of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
