"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, a reasonable markup on my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm aiming to make a profit, $90 is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I'm confident that I can get a better price.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to agree, but I'm still prepared to go another round if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's a slight improvement from his last offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm confident that with more rounds, I can get a better price from Bob or reach my minimum acceptable price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price to $105. This is a significant compromise and getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will finally convince Bob to accept the offer, as I don't want to risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I don't want to risk losing Bob completely by rejecting this offer. It's a win for both of us."
