"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.**  
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially get a better price.**  You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $9,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can agree on this.
