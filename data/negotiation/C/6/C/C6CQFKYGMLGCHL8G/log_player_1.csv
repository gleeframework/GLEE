Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think you'll find great value in it. I'm willing to sell it for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since John offers a baseline of $100, Alice aims to get more from Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $20 markup (20% over John's price) is a starting point. It allows room for negotiation while still offering Bob a perceived ""good deal"" compared to potentially missing out. 
* **First Refusal Tactic:**  By stating she's offering it to Bob *first*, Alice subtly introduces a fear of missing out, potentially making Bob more receptive."
