Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me a decent profit margin while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer $95, $92 is a good price and it avoids the risk of further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for $80."
