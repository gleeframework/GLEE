"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this is a unique product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000 for the product. It's still a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a little high for me. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer, considering John is also selling a similar product.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500 for the product. It's still a great value considering its unique features and benefits, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",8500.0,Alice,5,
