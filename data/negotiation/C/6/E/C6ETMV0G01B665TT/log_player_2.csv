"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $825,000. It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take John's offer of $800,000."
