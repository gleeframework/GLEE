"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1200000, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $850000. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your value of $800000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the midpoint between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $975000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1200000.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this transaction.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not ready to accept $925000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm thinking of a price that's slightly above the midpoint. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $950000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1200000.",950000.0,Alice,5,
