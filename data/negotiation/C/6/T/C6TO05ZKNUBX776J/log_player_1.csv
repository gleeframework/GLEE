Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $175. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above what I consider the minimum, giving me room to negotiate down if needed. I also want to be friendly and open to Bob's thoughts on the price, showing that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $150 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $135. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to see if I can negotiate a bit higher with Bob, but if he won't budge, I'm prepared to sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $135 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $142.50. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us to both get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 142.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $142.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $138. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $138
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $138 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can close the deal. If not, I'm ready to sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price we both agree on.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll have to sell to someone else. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
