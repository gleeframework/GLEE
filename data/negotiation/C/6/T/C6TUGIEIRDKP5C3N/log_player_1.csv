"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a reasonable starting point as it's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to the product's true value for Bob ($120) as possible without sacrificing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $130. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, it's a good deal considering the product is worth $120 to Bob.  I'm happy to close the deal and move on, rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $120."
