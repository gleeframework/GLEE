Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's exact willingness to pay above $8,000 is unknown. A higher initial offer helps gauge his interest and price sensitivity.
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000. This safety net allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. The key is to find a price that is agreeable to both parties while maximizing your profit potential."
