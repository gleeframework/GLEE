"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $90 is less than the $120 John is asking, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $90 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. It's a great product, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for a price higher than Bob's target of $85.  Although Alice seems willing to negotiate, Bob should continue to push for a lower price. He has several rounds left, and there's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target. How about we settle on $92.50? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $92.50, which is getting closer to Bob's target of $85 and well below the $120 John is offering.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, there's a good chance Alice won't budge further.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $27.50 compared to buying from John, which is a significant savings.  It's a good compromise, and there's a high chance Bob will be happy with the product."
