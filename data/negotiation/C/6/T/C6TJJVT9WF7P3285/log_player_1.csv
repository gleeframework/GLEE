Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down a bit to show I'm serious about getting this deal done. How about we settle at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still outside my range.  I'm prepared to go as high as $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some movement towards a higher price, the increments are too small to make continued negotiation worthwhile. Bob's offer is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut negotiations short and take John's offer of $1,000,000 to ensure the best possible outcome."
