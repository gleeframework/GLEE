"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

I understand that $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. Can you consider that?,107.5,Bob,4,
