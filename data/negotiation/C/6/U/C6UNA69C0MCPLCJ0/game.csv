,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to go up to $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,300,000 represents a fair valuation of this product's potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to move this forward.  This offer reflects a significant discount on the value you'll gain.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value and our respective positions.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
