Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,000,000. This price is fair, and it allows us to both close the deal.
