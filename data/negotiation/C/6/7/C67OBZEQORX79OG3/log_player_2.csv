"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my minimum price of $1,200,000 as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is within his budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  He should reject the offer and see if he can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save money. While $1,050,000 is closer to his ideal price, he can potentially get it for less. He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,000,000. This price is fair, and it allows us to both close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This price is still below my minimum, but I'm hoping we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still above Bob's maximum.  He has already reached his limit of negotiation, and it's more beneficial for him to buy from John at $1,000,000. This ensures he gets the product at his target price and avoids further haggling."
