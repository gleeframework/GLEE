Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your proposal, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Considering the product's worth to you is $12000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it would bring to me. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
