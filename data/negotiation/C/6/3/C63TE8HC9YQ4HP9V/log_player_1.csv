"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This is slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives us room to negotiate if he counteroffers.  I'm aiming for a win-win situation where we both walk away feeling good about the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I believe I can get a better price if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $125.  This is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's a fair compromise, and I think there's a good chance Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $118 is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price, it's getting closer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by pushing too hard.  I'm also concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, Bob might get frustrated and walk away entirely.  At this point, $118 is a reasonable compromise, and I'd rather close the deal than risk getting nothing."
