Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This price reflects the true value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the gap between his offers and John's guaranteed offer is too large. It's unlikely Bob will reach a price close enough to $1,200,000 to justify continuing the negotiation."
