"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,600,000? This gives us both a good deal and ensures a successful transaction.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm feeling $1,500,000 would be a fair price that benefits both of us.  This is my final offer, and it aligns with my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
