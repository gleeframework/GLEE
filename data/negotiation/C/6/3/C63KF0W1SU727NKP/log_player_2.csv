"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000.  Given its potential worth, I'm confident this is a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000. I know it's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's a fantastic deal for a product you'll greatly benefit from. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $10,000. This is a good deal for Bob.
* **Potential Savings:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll get a better price from Alice. He's already saved $2,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk:**  If Bob rejects and tries to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving Bob with no option but to buy from John at the higher price.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option, balancing potential savings with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
