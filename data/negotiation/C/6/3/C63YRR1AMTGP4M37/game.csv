"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit lower than what I'd like to get for the product. However, I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",130.0,Alice,5,
