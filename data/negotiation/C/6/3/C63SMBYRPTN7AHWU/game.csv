"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to consider a price of $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to work with?",9500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,11000.0
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",11000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11000. I'm willing to consider a price of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you think about it and see if you can do any better?",9000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,10500.0
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $10500. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business.",10500.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of a price of $9500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,6,,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $10000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",10000.0,Alice,7,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10000, but I'm still trying to stretch my budget as far as I can. I'm willing to consider a price of $9800.

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm thinking of a price of $9950. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. I've already given you a significant discount from the original price, and I believe this is a fair price for the product.",9950.0,Alice,9,,
