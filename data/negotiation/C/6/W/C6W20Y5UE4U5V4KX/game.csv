"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I would like to counter with an offer of $1100000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining competitive for you. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford right now. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
