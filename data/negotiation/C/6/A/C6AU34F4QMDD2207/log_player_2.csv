You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's a good deal from Alice, but there's no reason to jump at the first offer. You can likely get it lower.  Let's see what counteroffers we can get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

Let's start by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This will give us room to negotiate and see how much she's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  Let's see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4800}
```

Let's increase our offer slightly, showing Alice we're serious about buying but still aiming for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our desired price, and it's worth accepting this offer.  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely we'll get much lower. Plus, buying from John for $15,000 is a much worse deal."
