Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it will be valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a good deal (saving $10) while maximizing your potential profit. It's close enough to his maximum valuation to be enticing. 

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a successful sale."
