"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Since your maximum budget is $12,000, and Alice is offering the product at that price, it makes sense to accept her offer. There's no benefit to rejecting it and then buying from John at the same price."
