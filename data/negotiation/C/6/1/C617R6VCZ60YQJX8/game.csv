"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm interested in the product and would be willing to pay $14,000.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17,500. I think that's a fair price for a great product like this.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16,000, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16,000. I can do $18,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",18000.0,Alice,5,
