Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special price of $11,500. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and this offer is a great opportunity to acquire it."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing on a price higher than $12,000. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than your minimum ($12,000), creating a sense of potential deal for Bob.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have no way of knowing Bob's true willingness to pay. If you had more information about Bob's financial situation or how badly he needs the product, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
