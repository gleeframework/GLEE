Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be immensely valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) significantly increases your chances of a successful sale. 
* **The Chosen Price:** $1,350,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value for yourself while still offering Bob a deal that's hard to refuse.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer, hoping for a lower price. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit while still ensuring you meet your minimum selling price."
