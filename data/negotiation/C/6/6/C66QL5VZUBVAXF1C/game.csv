,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is the highest I can go, let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $10500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still outside my price range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8500. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. ",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. My counteroffer is $9500 for the product. I think this is as low as I'm willing to go.",9500.0,Alice,5,
