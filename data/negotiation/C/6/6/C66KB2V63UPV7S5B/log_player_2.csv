"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! Would you like to buy it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $140 is lower than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to her $120 valuation. You can always buy from John for $150 if needed."
