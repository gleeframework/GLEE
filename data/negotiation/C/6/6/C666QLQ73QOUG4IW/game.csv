"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  Given my maximum budget and the value I see in the product, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is a significant offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This is the maximum I can afford, and it represents a significant investment for me.  I'm confident this price is fair given the value of the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but the gap between our valuations is substantial.  I'm willing to make one final concession to find a solution.  My final offer is $950,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my desire to reach a deal with you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
