Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which I believe is a very fair price considering its unique features and potential.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $950,000 is getting close to my absolute bottom line.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000? This reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your willingness to negotiate.
