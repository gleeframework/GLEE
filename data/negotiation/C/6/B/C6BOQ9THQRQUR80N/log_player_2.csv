"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to start with a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $800,000 is a decent starting point, but there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

$750,000 is still too high.  Let's see if we can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise.  $750,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still looking for a bit more of a discount. How about $725,000?  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a discount, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $735,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $735,000 is getting close to my ideal price. I've already rejected her last offer and I'm not sure if she'll come down further. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the product by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept her offer and buy the product."
