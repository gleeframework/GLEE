"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the compromise.  $750,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still looking for a bit more of a discount. How about $725,000?  Let's make this happen.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire for a discount, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $735,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",735000.0,Alice,5,
