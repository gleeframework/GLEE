Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I'd normally sell it for.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $11,500 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the value for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a better outcome for both parties. 
* **Backup plan:**  The knowledge that John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me leverage if Bob is unwilling to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $10,800 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,800 is below my minimum threshold of $12,000. 
* **John is a better option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, eliminating any risk of a lower deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to counteroffer him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11,200 is my final offer. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  $11,200 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Final offer statement:**  Adding this creates pressure on Bob to accept or walk away. 
* **Reiterating value:**  I emphasize the product's value to remind Bob of the potential benefit. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down a bit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to pay $10,900 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation impasse:**  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation will likely involve more back-and-forth, potentially wasting time.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations. 

Even though I might be able to squeeze out a slightly higher price with Bob, the certainty of a sale to John at my desired price makes it the most advantageous decision at this point."
