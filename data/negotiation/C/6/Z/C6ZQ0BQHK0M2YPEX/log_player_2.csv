"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
It's a good idea to try and negotiate a lower price since Alice is starting significantly lower than your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Alice. I recognize the value of the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and acknowledge Alice's offer.** 
* **Signal that I'm serious about buying but need a lower price.**
* **Make a significant jump down in price** to try and move the negotiation along quicker."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, Bob. However, I'm still confident that the product's value to you is significantly higher than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value to you while also being a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice is moving closer to my price, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go.  Do we have a deal?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Here's the reasoning:

* **Show appreciation:** Acknowledging Alice's movement helps maintain a positive negotiation. 
* **Firm but fair:** Offering a slight increase shows I'm willing to compromise but sets a clear limit.
* **Sense of urgency:**  Phrasing it as ""as high as I can go""  might encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price for this product. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not going to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a deal that will work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice is unwilling to budge from her previous offer, and it seems unlikely she'll go any lower. While John's price is higher than I'd like, it makes more sense to buy from him at $1,500,000 than to continue a potentially fruitless negotiation with Alice."
