Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This would still leave us both with a good profit margin. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet at $850,000 and call it a day. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

**Reasoning:**  Alice has made it clear she won't go below $850,000. You have the option to buy from John for $800,000, which is your target price. It's time to cut your losses with Alice and secure the deal with John."
