"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset. I'm starting with a price of $950,000, reflecting its high quality and potential. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, reflecting a fair value for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position,  $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's aim for a price that's closer to the middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $875,000. This represents a significant discount for you while still providing me with a good value.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a good deal.  While $875,000 is tempting, it's still a bit too low for me. Let's try to bridge the gap further. I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This reflects a compromise on my end, and it's closer to your offer, but still ensures I receive a fair price.  What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,
