Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $14,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Above Bob's Value:** Offering it slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) creates a challenge but might be achievable with good negotiation.
* **Below John's Offer:** It's crucial to stay below $12,000, as that's your guaranteed sale price from John. 

This opening offer sets the stage for negotiation while keeping your desired profit margin in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($12,000). I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  It's worth seeing if I can negotiate Bob a bit higher before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, the product's worth to me is closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by dropping my price, but not drastically. The $12,500 offer is a compromise that's still above my minimum.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning the product's worth to me reinforces the idea that my price isn't arbitrary.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge Bob's flexibility and how badly he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $11,000. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached My Limit:**  Bob is clearly unwilling to budge much beyond $11,000.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to bridge the gap to my $12,000 minimum.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John's offer represents a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. It makes the most financial sense to take the sure thing. 

While I might have been able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the risk of him walking away entirely and the time spent negotiating aren't worth it in this scenario."
