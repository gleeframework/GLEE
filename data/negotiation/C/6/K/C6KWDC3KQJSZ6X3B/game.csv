"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm open to negotiations, but I'll start with a competitive price of $18000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $18000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I can offer you a compromise at $14000, which is a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $10000. If that's not acceptable, I might have to go with another offer. ",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I can offer you a compromise at $13500, which is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  Let's split the difference - how about $12000? This would be a good deal for both of us. ",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I can offer you a compromise at $13000, which is still a good deal for you and meets my minimum price. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
