"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $9,000 is a good starting point,  I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and it keeps us both happy. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $9,000. How about $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  How about $9,750? It's a small increase from your last offer, but it's a step closer to my desired price. I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $9,000. How about $9,375? That's the closest I can get to my target price.",9375.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal value.  Let's try one more compromise before we consider other options. How about $9,625? It's just a small step up from your last offer, but it shows we're both working towards a solution. What do you say?",9625.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,625. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,375. It's the closest I can get to my target price without going over. Can you meet me there?",9375.0,Bob,8,
