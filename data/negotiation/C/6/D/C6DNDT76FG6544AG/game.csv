"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $900000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay you $800000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can get this deal finalized. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $850000, so I'll offer you the product for $812500. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",812500.0,Alice,5,
