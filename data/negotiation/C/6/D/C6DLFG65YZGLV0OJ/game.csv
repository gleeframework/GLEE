"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I think a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I think we can meet in the middle somewhere between your initial offer and my counteroffer.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we settle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product has significant value, but I still think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
