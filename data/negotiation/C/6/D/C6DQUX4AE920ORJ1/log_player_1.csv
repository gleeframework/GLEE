Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While Bob's value is $100, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more. Starting at $125 leaves room for negotiation or acceptance.
* **Strategic positioning:** This price is closer to Bob's upper limit ($100) than John's guaranteed offer ($150). It aims to entice Bob without completely alienating him.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob's opinion, signaling potential flexibility in price if he negotiates.

This strategy aims to maximize profit by potentially securing a deal with Bob above his perceived value while having John as a safety net."
