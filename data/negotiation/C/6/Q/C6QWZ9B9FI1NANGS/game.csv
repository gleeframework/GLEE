"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $850,000 for it. This is the maximum amount I am willing to spend.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a little lower than what I'm hoping for.  I understand you're serious about this, so how about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it shows my commitment to making this work.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While $875,000 is closer to what I was willing to pay, I still believe we can reach a better agreement. How about $860,000? This would allow us to maintain a reasonable profit margin for you while staying within my budget.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $860,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $865,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement here.",865000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your proposal. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. How about we settle at $862,500? This would be a fair compromise between your initial asking price and my offer.",862500.0,Bob,6,
