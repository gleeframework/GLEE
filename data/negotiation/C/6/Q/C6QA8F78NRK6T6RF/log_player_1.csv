"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a fair starting point, as the product is worth $12,000 to both of us. I believe Bob is likely to counteroffer, giving us an opportunity to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum asking price of $12,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering $13,000 in this round.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable middle ground and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. There's still time left in the negotiation, and I'm going to try and get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500 in this round. This is just slightly above my minimum, but I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value and Bob's previous offers. I'm hoping this time Bob will see the value and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is it! Bob is finally offering my minimum price of $12,000. It's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm happy to accept it. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale."
