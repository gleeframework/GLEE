{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying the product from Alice for $14,000 when you can get it from John for $12,000.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

Let's start by offering Alice $11,000. This is a significant reduction from her initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Alice's offer is still too high.  We can likely negotiate a better price. Let's see if we can get her closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

Let's try a slightly higher counteroffer of $11,500. It's a compromise from our last offer, but still well below Alice's asking price."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to our target price, it's still not worth paying $12,500 when we can get it from John for $12,000. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down just a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's offer Alice our target price of $12,000.  This is the best deal for us, and hopefully she'll be willing to accept."
