"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement at a slightly lower price.",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,800 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $11,200? That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a price that's still beneficial for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
