"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below the value I place on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, but it reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired range, it's still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're able to accept.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,275,000 is your final offer, Alice, but I'm afraid it's still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach an agreement. I can offer $1,220,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept your offer. Otherwise, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $800,000.",1220000.0,Bob,6,
