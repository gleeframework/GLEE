"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I am confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to start the conversation at $500,000. ",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's find a more realistic middle ground - how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me here.  That said, $1,400,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable paying. Could you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations.  While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, I need to be realistic about the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a substantial offer, reflecting the product's true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I think that's a fair offer.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a fair price.  However, I can't accept $900,000.  To move this forward, I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,025,000.  This is a significant concession and reflects my desire to close this deal. Let me know your decision.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
