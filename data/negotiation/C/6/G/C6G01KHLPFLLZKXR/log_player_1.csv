Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I believe it would be a great asset to you. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price.
* **Strong Starting Point:** Starting at your desired minimum ($10,000) establishes a strong position.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While you have a fallback option, there might be a slight chance Bob values the product a bit higher than $8,000 and is willing to negotiate up slightly."
