Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [product description] for a price of $1,000,000. This is a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that is worth a significant amount to you. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, making him understand the potential gain from acquiring it. It also leaves room for further discussion, allowing Bob to ask questions and potentially negotiate.
* **Product Price:** The price is set at $1,000,000, which is the minimum value Bob is willing to pay. This ensures that I get the best possible deal while still securing the sale if Bob declines. 

**Strategy:**

By offering the product at Bob's minimum value, I maximize my potential profit. If Bob accepts, I get the maximum amount. If he rejects, I have a guaranteed backup offer from John. This strategy minimizes risk while ensuring I get a good price for my product."
