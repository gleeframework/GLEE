{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,190,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,190,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **High but Attractive:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but low enough that it might entice him if he believes the product is truly valuable or has potential beyond his initial assessment. 

**Important Note:** This offer assumes you don't have time constraints and John's offer is guaranteed. If you need to sell quickly, you might offer a lower price to Bob to increase the chances of a faster sale."
