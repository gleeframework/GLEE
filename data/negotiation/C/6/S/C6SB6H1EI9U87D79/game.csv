"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, $12,000 is still quite a ways off from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,5,
