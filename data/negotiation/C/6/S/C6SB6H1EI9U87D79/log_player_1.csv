Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can't afford $20,000. Could we discuss a price closer to my budget of $8,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. While I appreciate the offer, I still believe that $8,000 is a fair price for this product. Could we meet somewhere in between your previous offer and my initial proposal?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, $12,000 is still quite a ways off from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,500?"", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's aim for a compromise. Considering our previous discussions, could we agree on $13,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for more, accepting $13,000 is a good outcome at this point. It's significantly more than Bob initially offered and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
