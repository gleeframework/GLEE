"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you.  I'm confident it's worth at least $800000 to me, and I'm offering it to you for $950000. This represents a substantial opportunity, and I'm eager to discuss the potential benefits it could bring to your operations.  Let me know if you'd like to schedule a meeting to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price ($950,000 vs $1,500,000).** This represents a potential saving of $550,000.
* **Even though Bob doesn't know the product's true value to Alice**, it's still a good deal based on the information available. 
* **The goal is to save as much money as possible**, and accepting Alice's offer achieves that."
