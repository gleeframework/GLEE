Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** $110 is higher than Bob's $80 valuation, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $110 is still above your $120 minimum, so you're not selling at a loss.
* **It's a clear message:** It's straightforward and invites Bob to respond. 

Remember, this is just the first step. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would you be willing to consider $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's also below your initial offer of $110, so it's reasonable to assume you can push for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and attempt to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good strategy for a few reasons:

* **It shows flexibility:** It indicates that you're willing to negotiate, but not at any price. 
* **It's still above your minimum:** $100 is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves room for a possible deal.
* **It's within Bob's range:** Bob initially offered $90, so $100 is still within his budget range.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward, while also pushing for a price that's closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose $95 as the price for the product. This allows us to stay close to each other's expectations while respecting my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120 and even your previous offer of $100.  This indicates that Bob is willing to negotiate, but it's not clear if he's willing to go higher.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $98, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a great product, and you'll be getting a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 98}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good strategy:

* **It's a small compromise:** It shows flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but it's not a drastic concession.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  $98 is still above your $120 minimum, so you're not selling at a loss. 
* **It's a clear message:**  It's a direct response to Bob's offer, clearly stating your new price and encouraging a response. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while trying to achieve a price that's closer to your desired outcome."
