"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to keep the price as low as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $8,200, I can still potentially get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,200 is too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $8,800 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 8800} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,800 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $8,400. I'm really trying to get the best deal I can on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, the negotiations are getting long and the risk of losing the deal to John is growing. $8,400 is a reasonable price, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale completely."
