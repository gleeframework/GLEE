It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original price, and it's unlikely she'll move significantly in the last round. Buying from John for $1,200,000, even though it's higher than Alice's current offer, makes more sense at this point.  This avoids the risk of Alice not budging further and ensures you get the product without potentially overpaying in the final round."
