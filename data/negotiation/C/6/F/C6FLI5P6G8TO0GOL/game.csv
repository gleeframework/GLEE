"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $10,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
