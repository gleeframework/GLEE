"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with a figure significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and signals the product's value. 
* **Anchoring:** This high starting price acts as an anchor. While Bob may not agree to this price, it sets a reference point for the rest of the negotiation.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,500,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is above his perceived value of the product ($800,000), which is a positive sign.  It suggests he's genuinely interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still a significant gap between his offer and both your minimum ($1,000,000) and your initial asking price. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open.
* **John as Backup:**  While selling to John is a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's potential to secure a better deal with Bob. 

We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle during the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly significant. Let's meet somewhere in the middle.  How about $1,200,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While still above our minimum, this counteroffer shows Bob we're willing to negotiate and have significantly reduced the price from our initial offer.
* **Targeting Above Midpoint:** We're aiming for a price point closer to our minimum while acknowledging Bob's offer. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you're placing on this product, but $1,200,000 is still too much for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This is a serious offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Target:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, now at $950,000. This indicates he's motivated to close the deal.
* **Marginal Difference:**  There's only a $50,000 difference between his offer and John's guaranteed price. It's worth seeing if we can close that gap.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We have six rounds remaining, providing space for a few more counteroffers if necessary.

We'll try to nudge Bob closer to the $1,000,000 mark in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Your offer is very close to what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** We're acknowledging Bob's commitment while making a smaller concession than previous rounds. This signals that we're getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Aiming High But Realistic:** The $1,075,000 price point is still significantly above Bob's offer but allows room for one more counter-offer if he's unwilling to meet this price. 
* **Time Consideration:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, so creating a sense of urgency is important to encourage Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,075,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $975,000. This is my final offer, let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, making further negotiation unlikely.
* **Minimal Gain:** Accepting Bob's offer would only net us $25,000 more than John's guaranteed price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk that he walks away, leaving us with a less favorable outcome. 

At this point, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential, but small, gain from Bob.  It's time to secure the $1,000,000 and move on."
