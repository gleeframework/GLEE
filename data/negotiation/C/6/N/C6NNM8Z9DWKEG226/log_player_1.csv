Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($150) but lower than what it's worth to Bob ($120). This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than my minimum, I can still try to get closer to my target price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm going to counter with $145. It's a small step closer to my target price of $150, and it leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $135 is getting close to my minimum of $150, but I'm not confident I can push him higher.  John's offer of $150 guarantees me my minimum profit, making it the best option right now."
