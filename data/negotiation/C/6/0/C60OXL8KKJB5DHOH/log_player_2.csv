"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a price of $180. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so you should try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! However, $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $120, we're aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is framed positively to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Alice to continue bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can meet you in the middle at $165. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $165 is still more than you want to pay. You know John will sell it to you for $150. There's room to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about $135? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We're moving closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and Alice's latest price. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  The tone remains respectful and collaborative to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still significantly below John's $150 price, giving us some bargaining power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do a bit better than that, Bob. I'll meet you at $155. It's a great price for a fantastic product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $155. Since you can buy the product for $150 from John, there's no point in continuing the negotiation. You've reached a point where accepting Alice's offer would cost you more."
