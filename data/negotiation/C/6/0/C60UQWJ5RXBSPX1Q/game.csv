"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
