"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in purchasing it from me? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is within his budget, it's still more than he wants to pay. He'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his own valuation of the product.  He's starting with a reasonable counteroffer, not too far off Alice's initial price, hoping to open the door to further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can meet you in the middle at $107.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to get the price as low as possible. While $107.5 is closer to his target, he still has room to negotiate. He'll try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about $106? That's a good middle ground for us both, and I'm really interested in this product."", ""product_price"": 106}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying persistent, gradually lowering the price. $106 is still within his budget, but closer to his target.  He's aiming for a small compromise from Alice to reach a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $108. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would prefer a lower price, Alice's counteroffer of $108 is getting closer to his target. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal, especially since he has a backup option with John at $120. Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product while still saving some money compared to John."
