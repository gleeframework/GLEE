"I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product for a price of $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer of $900,000, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,000,000. However, I'll throw in a small concession - I'll give you a 1% discount, so the price would be $990,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,5,
