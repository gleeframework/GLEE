Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below what I value the product at. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,300,000? That's a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a little high for me.  Could you do $1,225,000? I feel that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. Accepting $1,225,000 would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table. I'll counter in the next round, but I need to start considering John's offer more seriously as we progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. Let's split the difference â€“ $1,260,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I need to see some movement from your side to justify letting go of this valuable product at that price."",
""product_price"": 1260000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this negotiation is taking longer than I'd hoped. I'm willing to move a bit to get this done. Would you consider $1,240,000?  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly committed to getting the product but is also hesitant to meet my initial price. $1,240,000 is a significant amount, and while it's less than I hoped for, continuing to negotiate risks losing him entirely. It's a strong offer, and it's time to close the deal."
