Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, my goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 puts Bob in a position where he's getting a $100,000 discount compared to its value to him. This makes the offer enticing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, still keeping me above my minimum.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while acknowledging Bob's valuation and the existence of a backup buyer."
