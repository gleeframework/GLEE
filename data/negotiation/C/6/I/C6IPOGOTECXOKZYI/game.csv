,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair starting point given my budget constraints.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for your offer. While I appreciate the compromise, $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I'm not sure I can go higher than that. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still significant.  To be frank, I have another potential buyer who's offering closer to my asking price. I'm willing to give you one more chance to make a competitive offer.  Can you significantly improve your offer, otherwise I need to consider my other option.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and the pressure from other potential buyers. While I can't match your asking price, I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,300,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate the effort, but your current offer is still significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm running out of time and need to be realistic. My final offer is $1,600,000. This is a firm offer, and I need a decision soon.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
