Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will pay off in the long run.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I am willing to pay $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price, and I believe there's still room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This would still give you a significant price advantage compared to what others might be willing to pay."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1100000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit higher. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not yet willing to settle for this price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,150,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. After evaluating the situation further, I am willing to offer $1125000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal. Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and we're getting closer to my initial asking price. I don't want to risk losing a sale and potentially getting a worse offer from Bob later or having to sell to John for a lower price."
