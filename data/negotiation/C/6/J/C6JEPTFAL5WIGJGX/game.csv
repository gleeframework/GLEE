"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $7,000?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a significant jump from your previous offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  However,  $10,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to come up to $7,500.  I feel that's a fair offer considering we're both trying to find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,6,
