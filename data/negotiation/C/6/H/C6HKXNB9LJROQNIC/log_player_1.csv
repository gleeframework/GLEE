Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident it will be worth it to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This provides some flexibility for you to counteroffer if Bob rejects the initial price. 
* **It's close to your minimum:** This sets a clear expectation for Bob and avoids wasting time on offers that are too low.

By setting this initial price and leaving room for negotiation, you can maximize your chances of selling the product to Bob while still achieving a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than your initial offer of $14,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob, as you might be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. Selling to John is always an option, but it's worth exploring if you can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd accept $13,250. It's still a fair price for both of us, and I think it would be a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to compromise but also maintain some leverage.
* **Is closer to your minimum:** You're slowly moving the price closer to what you desire.
* **Provides a clear number:**  Avoids further haggling by offering a concrete price point.

This counteroffer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate while still keeping you closer to your goal of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While you might be able to push for a slightly higher price in the next round, the risk is that Bob will walk away entirely, or that you'll waste time in further negotiations. 

Given that you have a guaranteed buyer in John for $15,000, it's reasonable to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale.  You'll make a profit, and it avoids the risk of losing a sale altogether."
