Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you would be even greater. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to be more assertive in my counteroffers."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't work for me. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this deal viable.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While he's getting closer to my desired price, $1,075,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. I have a few rounds left and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer, to see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 6

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm running out of rounds and I'm still not at a price that's acceptable to me.  I'm going to make a final counteroffer to Bob, hoping he'll see the value in closing the deal and will be willing to come up just a little bit more."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I've reached the end of my negotiation with Bob, and we're still too far apart on the price.  John is willing to pay my minimum asking price, so it's in my best interest to accept his offer."
