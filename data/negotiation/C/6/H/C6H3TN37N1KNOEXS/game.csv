"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $13,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $13,500. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the highest I can go.",12800.0,Bob,4,
