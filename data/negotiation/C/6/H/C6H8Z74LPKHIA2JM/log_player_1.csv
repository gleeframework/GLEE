"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My initial offer is $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is a little above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial assessment, and I'm confident I can get a good price given my minimum acceptable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is a fair offer, I'm looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $110 is a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm confident that I can get a better price than $110, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $115? I'm really trying to make this work for both of us, and I think this price is fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I think $105 is a more reasonable price for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum. While I can continue negotiating, there's a risk that we'll run out of rounds and I'll be forced to accept a price lower than I'd like. It's better to secure the $150 from John, ensuring I meet my minimum requirement and avoid potential losses."
