Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, close to the midpoint between my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes a good deal for both parties, making Bob more likely to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while leaving space for negotiation, allowing me to potentially earn more than the $10,000 from John if Bob accepts or makes a counteroffer I find favorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer you $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate my willingness to hold out for a better price. This creates leverage in the next round.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price closer to my desired $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I'm happy to accept $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from my previous $13,000 to $12,000, moving closer to Bob's offer of $11,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive, emphasizing fairness and the value Bob would gain from the product. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth, subtly emphasizing why a slightly higher price is justified.

By moving closer to Bob's offer, I increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement while still securing a higher price than what John would offer."
