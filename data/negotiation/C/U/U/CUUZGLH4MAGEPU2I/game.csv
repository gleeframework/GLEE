"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,200,000.  This price reflects its significant value, while also offering you a substantial return on your investment.  Please let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still reflects the significant value of the product, while also allowing for a comfortable profit margin for you.  Let's continue working towards a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still looking to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit off. Let's split the difference and settle on $975,000. This is a fair compromise that ensures we both benefit from this transaction.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I won't be able to go any higher than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to be within my budget. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
