Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $500,000 to $700,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Bob's offer:

Bob is unwilling to budge beyond his $700,000 limit. It's clear further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap between his valuation and mine. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the most logical choice at this point."
