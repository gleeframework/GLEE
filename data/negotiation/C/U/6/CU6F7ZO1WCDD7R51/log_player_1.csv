Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me a good margin while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay this price. If not, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum threshold of $80. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale quickly and avoid potential delays or complications in further negotiation."
