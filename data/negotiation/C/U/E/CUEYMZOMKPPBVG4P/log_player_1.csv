Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a one-of-a-kind [briefly describe product, focusing on benefits]. I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening with a benefit-focused message:**  This encourages Bob to consider the product's value. 
* **Starting price:**  I'm starting with $10,000, knowing my minimum is $8,000. This allows room for negotiation while ensuring I get a good price.
* **Open-ended question:**  ""Let me know what you think"" allows Bob to respond in a way that signals his interest level. 

This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Does he respond positively or with a counteroffer?
* **Establish a starting point:**  I've set the initial price and created an opportunity for Bob to negotiate.
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  This gives me a chance to gauge Bob's value for the product and potentially adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm very interested in your product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $7500?  I'm ready to close the deal if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain my value:**  Showing I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum price.
* **Continue negotiations:**  I can potentially get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Gain more information:**  Bob's willingness to offer $7,500 provides valuable information about his perceived value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's position:**  Showing I understand his budget constraint.
* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum but demonstrates flexibility.
* **Positive framing:**  ""Find a solution"" focuses on a win-win scenario.

This approach aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Bridge the gap:**  The $8,500 counteroffer brings us closer to an agreement.
* **Encourage further discussion:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counter or agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $8500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Let's meet in the middle at $8250.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,250 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and it seems he's serious about closing the deal.  Accepting his offer is the best option for the following reasons:

* **Meeting in the middle:**  His offer is a reasonable compromise and shows he's willing to negotiate.
* **Time efficiency:**  Accepting avoids further rounds of counteroffers, saving time and effort.
* **Secure sale:**  Accepting ensures a sale and prevents potentially losing out to John. 

While I could potentially squeeze a little more out of Bob, the risk of further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a rejection of the offer.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and profitable decision at this stage."
