Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering its significant value proposition."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $800,000 (your guaranteed offer from John).

This offer aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference between what Bob is willing to pay and your minimum acceptable price. 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** The offer price of $1,200,000 allows you to potentially earn $400,000 more than your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is strong, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale.

It's a balanced approach that seeks to maximize your potential earnings while still presenting an attractive offer to Bob."
