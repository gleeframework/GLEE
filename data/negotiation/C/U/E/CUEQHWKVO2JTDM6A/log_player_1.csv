{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to part with the product, $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is more than what I'd get from John, I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product, but $9000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can close the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I will accept Bob's offer. While I initially wanted more, $8,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's also the same amount I'd get from John, so I'm happy with this outcome."
