"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing your product, and I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our negotiation, $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. Let's meet in the middle for a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice's position, but I believe we can find a compromise. I would like to propose a price of $1,375,000. This is higher than my initial offer, but still within my budget. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 one more time. If you're not comfortable with that, I might have to look at other options.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I've considered your last offer carefully, and I would like to propose a price of $1,387,500. This is an increase from my previous offer and closer to your latest suggestion. I hope this proposal will be more agreeable.",1387500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm still not quite there, though. I'm going to need to go up to $1,400,000 on this one. I know it's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's a price that makes sense for me.  If this isn't feasible for you, I'll have to consider other options.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,7,
