Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $9,500? I think that's a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.
