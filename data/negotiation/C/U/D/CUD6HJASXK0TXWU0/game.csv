"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $100 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $95.  That's the absolute most I can do.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to pay $95, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a small concession and offer it to you for $98. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower.",98.0,Alice,5,
