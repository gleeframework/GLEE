{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and make him more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering $175, I'm acknowledging that I'm open to negotiation and creating space for Bob to counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable value and John's offer as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **John's offer is a much better option.**  I can guarantee a sale for $150, which is much closer to my minimum price.  

**Next Steps:**

*  I'll reject Bob's offer and prepare a counteroffer that is more reasonable and closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for us both. While $80 is definitely too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to $130.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need for this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:** I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer outright. I'm giving him a counteroffer with a reason, indicating that I'm open to negotiation but also maintaining my ground.
* **Moving Towards the Middle:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable value.  
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and suggesting that $130 is still a good deal for him.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the counteroffer, I've secured a sale.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John. The decision will depend on how much further I'm willing to negotiate and how confident I am that I can secure a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I'd prefer to get. 
* **John's offer is a guaranteed profit.**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll sell the product to John for $150, securing a sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
