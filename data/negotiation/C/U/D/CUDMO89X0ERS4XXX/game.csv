"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $800000 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. I'm open to negotiation, but this is a good starting point. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750000 is a significant amount, it doesn't quite reflect the true value I see in this. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your perspective while still allowing me to get a reasonable price. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. Is there any flexibility to meet me in the middle?,700000.0,Bob,4,
