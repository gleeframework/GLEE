"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's see if we can make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",8250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,250 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $8,750. That's a fair compromise, and it's the closest I can get to your price.  What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm getting close to my budget, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",8500.0,Bob,6,
