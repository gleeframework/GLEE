"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for $1250000. I believe its value to you is significantly higher, and this price reflects a fair compromise.  If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another interested party. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Buying from Alice for $1,250,000 saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You're still getting a good deal:** Even though Alice values the product at $1,000,000, you're only paying $1,250,000, which is still less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000."
