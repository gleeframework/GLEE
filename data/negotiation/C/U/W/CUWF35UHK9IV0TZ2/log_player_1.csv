Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for potential negotiation while still ensuring I get at least $80, which is my minimum value."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm countering with $90. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

Bob's offer of $85 is getting closer to my desired price point and is more than what John would pay. I'll accept his offer to secure the deal."
