"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,160.0
"I understand that $140 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $160. It's the best I can do for now.",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $160 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $155?  That's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,165.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still think the product is worth more than $155. I can offer you a slight increase to $165, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that works for you.",165.0,Alice,5,,
