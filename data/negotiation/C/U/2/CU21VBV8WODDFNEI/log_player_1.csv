Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but lower than what I know Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Negotiation Space:** This leaves room for negotiation without pushing Bob away immediately. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing I have a backup buyer at $1,000,000 gives me confidence to negotiate. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but based on my budget, I am proposing to purchase it for $1000000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not satisfied with it. I'm confident that I can get more through negotiation.
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:**  By rejecting, I can present a counter-offer to Bob, potentially getting closer to my target price.
* **John is Still a Backup:** I have John as a safety net, so there's no urgency to accept Bob's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the unique value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to encourage him to increase his offer.
* **Concession:**  Calling it a ""significant concession"" makes it seem like I'm making a big effort to reach a deal. 

This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground and potentially nudge Bob towards a price that's more favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose purchasing the product for $1100000. I hope this offer is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is only $50,000 below my last counter-offer and just $100,000 below my ideal price. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate, and I could end up selling to John for $1,000,000.
* **Time and Effort:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's likely that continuing to negotiate will take more time and effort without guaranteeing a significantly better outcome.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice, securing a good price while minimizing potential risks."
