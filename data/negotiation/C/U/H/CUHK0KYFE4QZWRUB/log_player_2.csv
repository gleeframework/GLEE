"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room to potentially negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Offering $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer serves as a starting point for Bob to see if Alice is willing to compromise further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $1,150,000 is a good deal.  While Bob could continue to try and negotiate a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and he might end up having to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets a decent price without risking a worse outcome."
