"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $100 is still more than the product is worth to Bob ($120).  It's better to reject and see if Alice will lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's fair to both of them.  He knows the product is worth $80 to Alice, and he's willing to pay a little more than that. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also wants to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Current offer:** $92.50.
* **Alternative:** Buy from John for $120.

Although $92.50 is lower than Alice's first offer, it's still more than Bob is comfortable paying.  He's willing to risk another round to see if he can get a better price.  It's also worth noting that if he rejects, Alice has already indicated she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible, but also close the deal.
* **Current situation:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and Bob wants to take advantage of that.
* **Counteroffer:**  $90 is a compromise between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous counteroffer.  It shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a better price."
