"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I have to consider my own costs and profit margins. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go as low as $9000. How about we compromise at $10500? This is a fair price that still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
