Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this negotiation, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, to be transparent, $900,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value.  I'm willing to consider $1,250,000, which I believe is a very strong offer considering the true worth of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a different view of the product's value. However,  $1,250,000 is still beyond my reach. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's bridge the gap and finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
