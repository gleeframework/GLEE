"Hi Alice,  $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify paying more than $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding my position. While $1,600,000 represents a fair starting point considering its value, I'm willing to move down to $1,450,000. I believe this shows significant movement on my side to find a mutually beneficial outcome.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $900,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this negotiation, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, to be transparent, $900,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value.  I'm willing to consider $1,250,000, which I believe is a very strong offer considering the true worth of this product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a different view of the product's value. However,  $1,250,000 is still beyond my reach. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's bridge the gap and finalize a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
