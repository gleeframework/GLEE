"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1300000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but it's my final one. I can offer it to you for $1550000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make one more counteroffer, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one more time. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1525000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1525000.0,Bob,6,
