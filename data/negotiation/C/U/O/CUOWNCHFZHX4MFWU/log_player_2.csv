Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already gone a bit lower than I wanted to. I'm willing to meet you at $82.50, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's my final offer 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go down to $80, and it's not worth risking the remaining rounds for a $2.50 difference. Buying from John guarantees the best price within your budget."
