Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but ensures I get a significant amount over his perceived value.
* **Encouraging a Quick Sale:** By phrasing it as a ""fair price"" and asking for Bob's thoughts, I subtly encourage him to accept without protracted negotiation.

This offer balances my desire for maximum profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and accepting the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
