"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  Since Bob values the product at $120, I'm leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $140 is better than my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm willing to risk losing this deal to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is a decent price, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as there are still rounds left, and I believe I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm lowering my price again, trying to meet Bob halfway.  I believe $145 is a fair compromise that allows both of us to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me. I'm not willing to accept such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and secure a profitable sale."
