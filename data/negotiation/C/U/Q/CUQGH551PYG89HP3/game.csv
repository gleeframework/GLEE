"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12500. I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I've already gone as low as I can without losing too much profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other offers. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
