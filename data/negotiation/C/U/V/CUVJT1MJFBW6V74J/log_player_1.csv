{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 would be fair for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is above your minimum price of $1,200,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's space for him to counter without you feeling pressured to accept a low price.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  By starting high, you set the tone for a profitable negotiation."
