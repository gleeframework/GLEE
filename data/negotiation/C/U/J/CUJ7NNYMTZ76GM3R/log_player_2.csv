"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. I believe it would be a great addition to your collection, valued at $80 by you. My initial offer is $95. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $95 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
