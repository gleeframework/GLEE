"I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I think that's a fair price for the value this product will bring to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $7,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  I believe this product will be a great investment for you, and this price reflects its true value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,200. I think this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value and the market price I've researched.",8200.0,Bob,4,
