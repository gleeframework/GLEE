"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I see the value, that's still a little too high for my budget. Could we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $825,000 is very tempting, but I need to stay closer to $800,000 for this to make sense. How about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to stay close to $800,000, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $800,000, but only if you're willing to meet me halfway on the price. I'll throw in some additional value-added services worth $25,000 to sweeten the deal.",800000.0,Alice,7,
