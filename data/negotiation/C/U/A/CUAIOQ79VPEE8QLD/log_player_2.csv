Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to stay close to $800,000, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to make one more concession.

Alice has reached her lowest acceptable price, and throwing in additional services is a bonus.  Taking the deal now guarantees you the product at a great price.  Continuing to negotiate has the risk of Alice backing out entirely."
