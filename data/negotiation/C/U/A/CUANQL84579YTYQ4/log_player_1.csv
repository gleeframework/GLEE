{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  I've already made several concessions to Bob and it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that's acceptable to me. It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than to risk getting less from Bob or continuing to negotiate and potentially running out of rounds."
