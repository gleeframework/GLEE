"Alice, $25000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $15000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $15000 is lower than my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $20000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $20000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $17500?  I believe this is a fair compromise that would benefit both of us.",17500.0,Bob,4,
