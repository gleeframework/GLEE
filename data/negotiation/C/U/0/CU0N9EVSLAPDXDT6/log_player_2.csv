It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, you have room to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and you still have room to save money. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target price of $1,000,000."

Alice has come down a bit, and while not ideal, $1,175,000 is still a decent saving compared to buying from John.  It's getting close to your counteroffers, and further negotiation might not yield much more. It's a good point to accept and secure the deal."
