"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm willing to pay a maximum of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it's below my minimum threshold.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to receive at least $1,050,000 for the product. This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum threshold and  a good compromise.  It's better than selling to John for $1,000,000, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
