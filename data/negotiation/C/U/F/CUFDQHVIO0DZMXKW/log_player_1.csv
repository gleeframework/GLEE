Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I could maybe go a little higher, how about $90?

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach my $100 minimum. John offers a guaranteed $100, which is better than the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob."
