Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to sell to John. We're getting close with Bob, but it's getting risky to continue.  I've only got two rounds left, and I'm not sure I can get to my target price.  It's better to be safe than sorry, and John is offering a guaranteed $15,000."
