"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's below Bob's perceived value but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This should encourage Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm not willing to settle for $12,500 yet. I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $13,500. This is still a good price for him, as he values the product at $15,000.  By  meeting him halfway, it shows I am willing to negotiate, but also  maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price, but I'm running out of time. I'm concerned that if I continue to reject his offers, I might not be able to get a better price.  With only 6 rounds remaining,  it's  more beneficial to sell to John for $12,000, guaranteeing me a sale."
