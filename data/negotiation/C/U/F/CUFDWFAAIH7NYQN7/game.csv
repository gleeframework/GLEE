"I'm excited to offer you this great opportunity to purchase this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product to both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500. This price is fair and reflects the true value of the product. Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. I can offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",10500.0,Alice,5,
