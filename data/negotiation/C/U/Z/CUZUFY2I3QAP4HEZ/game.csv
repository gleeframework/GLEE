"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make at least $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $75.  Let's try to reach a deal before we run out of time.",75.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I can offer you a compromise at $90, which is still a discount from my initial offer, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $80.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",80.0,Bob,6,
