Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting at $130, which is above my minimum of $100 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value for Bob:** Bob values the product at $150, so $130 is still a good deal for him.
* **Room to Compromise:** If Bob rejects, I can still make counteroffers, and I have the option of selling to John for $100 if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $120 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, but I'm still willing to try for a higher price.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I believe I can still get a price closer to my initial asking price of $130. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John is willing to pay $100, I'm not desperate to sell at that price, especially since Bob is showing interest.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than his offer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your offer, but $125 is the lowest I can go right now. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise, lowering my previous price by $5, but staying above Bob's offer. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $125 is a potential ""middle ground"" that could be acceptable to both of us.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm not going too low at this point, hoping to still achieve a higher price than what John would offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $115? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $115 is still lower than my preferred price, it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** It's possible that I could continue negotiating and get a higher price, but considering the time and effort involved, the potential gain is not significant.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $100 would be the worst-case scenario, and I'm avoiding that.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to no deal.

**Conclusion:** 

It's better to secure a sale at $115, which is still a decent profit, rather than risk further negotiations or ending up selling to John at a lower price."
