"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly less than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. While $130 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $80? That's a reasonable price, and I'm ready to buy right now at that amount.",80.0,Bob,4,
