"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offer, how about $13,250? This is a fair price for both of us and ensures we can both walk away satisfied.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
