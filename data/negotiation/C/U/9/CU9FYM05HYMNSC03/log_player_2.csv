"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $90. It's worth more than that to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is less than John's price of $100, you know you have a backup option. By rejecting this offer, you might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
