"Hi Alice, $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8250?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's make this happen!",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $8250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8000? That's fair to both of us and gets this deal done.",8000.0,Bob,4,
