"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to gain from this transaction. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $800,000.",850000.0,Alice,1,
