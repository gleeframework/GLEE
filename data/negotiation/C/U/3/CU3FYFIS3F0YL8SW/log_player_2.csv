# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer. $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,500. It's the best I can do at this point.

* **Bob's Budget:** Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000. 
* **Potential Savings:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $3,500 compared to buying from John.
