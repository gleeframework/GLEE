Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,000,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate, but it's also significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you don't give away too much.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing fairness and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's response:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer myself.
* **John's offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'll try to negotiate with Bob first to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not close enough.** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still $300,000 below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is too drastic at this stage.**  I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob before resorting to John's offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap between our desired prices.  I'll aim for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $950,000, a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I emphasize that this is a ""fair compromise"" and a way for both of us to be satisfied. This encourages Bob to accept.
* **Closing statement:** I use a strong closing statement (""Let's close this deal!"") to convey urgency and encourage a quick decision. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's response:** If Bob accepts, great! If not, I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer again, or move on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer $925,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum.**  $925,000 is only $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant gains.**  At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal, and the risk of Bob walking away is high.
* **Time is a factor.**  While I prefer to get closer to my desired price, delaying the sale further could risk losing Bob entirely and having to settle for John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept the offer.**  I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale.  This ensures I get a good price, albeit not my ideal, and it avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
