"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to me ($1,000,000) and slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Strong Opening:**  My message is confident and emphasizes the product's value. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  By starting high, I create a buffer for negotiation and hopefully entice Bob to counteroffer.

**Important Note:** This is just the beginning of the negotiation. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to his perceived value than mine. While it's tempting to accept, I have more room to negotiate.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  With 9 rounds remaining, I can likely secure a better deal by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. I believe I can push for a price closer to $1,000,000.
* **Avoiding a Quick Loss:** Selling to John right now would secure $1,000,000, but I might be able to get more by continuing the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, attempting to bridge the gap between his offer and my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $950,000 is still a bit below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which reflects the product's unique qualities. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a significant decrease from my initial offer ($1,200,000) but still above Bob's offer ($950,000). It shows flexibility while maintaining a price closer to my desired value.
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes the unique qualities of the product, reinforcing its value and justifying my price.
* **Seeking Compromise:** I explicitly state my desire to find a compromise, encouraging Bob to respond positively and continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:** I'll observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to adjust my strategy again, considering the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I respect the value of the product, but I'm still unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this is closer to what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my desired price of $1,000,000. However, it's still slightly above my minimum acceptable price, and I want to see if I can secure a better deal.
* **Remaining Rounds:** With 6 rounds left, I have ample time to negotiate further.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  It's possible that Bob might be willing to increase his offer a bit more, especially if he truly wants the product.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to push for a price closer to $1,000,000. I will also consider selling to John if further negotiations with Bob prove unsuccessful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,050,000 still falls just short of what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, demonstrating my desire to reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** My counteroffer of $1,025,000 is a small decrease from Bob's offer ($1,050,000) and only $25,000 above my minimum acceptable price.  This shows flexibility while still holding onto a decent profit.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** My message reiterates my willingness to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Staying Firm:** I'm not willing to drop further than $1,025,000 at this point. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess my options, potentially moving closer to John's offer.

**Next Steps:** I'll carefully observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. With 5 rounds remaining, time is running out to secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in reducing your asking price. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose $1,000,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 perfectly matches my minimum acceptable price. It's a win for me, as I'm not losing any money.
* **No Need for Further Negotiation:**  There's no point in rejecting Bob's offer and potentially risking a deal.  I'm at my minimum acceptable price, and I could end up losing money by continuing to negotiate.
* **Time Constraint:**  With 4 rounds remaining, the pressure to close the deal is increasing. Accepting Bob's offer secures a deal and avoids the risk of losing out on the sale altogether.

**Conclusion:**  While I could have continued to negotiate,  accepting Bob's offer ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
