"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it today.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as 95. How about we compromise at 100? It's still a good price for both of us, and it's the price I was initially thinking of selling it for.",100.0,Alice,5,
