"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's try to reach an agreement.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence.  $85 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $87.50? This is a good compromise, and we can close the deal now.",87.5,Alice,5,
