Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 allows for some back-and-forth if Bob tries to negotiate. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** This price is significantly above your $1,200,000 minimum, ensuring a substantial profit.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Mentioning ""before I make it available to others"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
