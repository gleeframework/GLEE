"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, allowing me to gain a decent profit while giving you a significant value. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I see the value in your product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far below my minimum asking price.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,000,000? This would still be a good deal for you, given the value you mentioned, and it would allow me to move closer to my desired price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's try $900,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to get a valuable product at a price that's still within your budget.",900000.0,Alice,5,
