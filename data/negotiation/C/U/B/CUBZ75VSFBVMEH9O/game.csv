"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a fair compromise. This way, you get a great product at a great price, and I can get closer to my target price. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for understanding.  $12,500 is close, but I'm trying to stay closer to $11,500. Would that work for you?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there with $11,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? This would be a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  It's also my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not sure I can go lower. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,7,
