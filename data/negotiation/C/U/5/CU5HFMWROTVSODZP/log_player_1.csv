Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair offer that still allows you to reap substantial benefits."",
""product_price"": 1400000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down from $1,800,000 to $1,400,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000, but I need you to come down further. I'm willing to offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, accepting $900,000 would still mean losing out on a significant portion of the product's value. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us.  To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm getting close to my limit, so I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating willingness to negotiate. However, the difference between his offer ($950,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) is relatively small now. It's strategically advantageous to hold firm a bit longer and see if I can secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. I believe this is my final offer, as it represents a significant reduction on my end."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** By stating this is my final offer, I signal seriousness and a limit to my flexibility. 
* **Small Concession:**  The smaller reduction ($100,000) compared to previous rounds shows I'm getting close to my bottom line.
* **Pressure:**  This puts the ball in Bob's court and may encourage him to make a more substantial move if he's genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to consider buying from John at $1,000,000, so I'd like to see if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. His mention of John at $1,000,000 is likely a negotiation tactic, but it also highlights the readily available alternative.
* **Minimal Gain:**  Continuing with Bob carries the risk of a failed negotiation, potentially leading to a worse outcome than accepting John's offer. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Further negotiation with Bob consumes time and effort that could be directed toward other potential buyers or opportunities. 

While securing slightly more than $980,000 from Bob is possible, the risk outweighs the potential reward. Accepting John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer is the most rational choice at this point."
