"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I know it's valuable and worth it, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit if you're interested. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's starting offer is above your maximum budget. While she mentions negotiation, it's best to see if she'll come down to a more reasonable price first.  You can always reconsider if she counters with a lower price."
