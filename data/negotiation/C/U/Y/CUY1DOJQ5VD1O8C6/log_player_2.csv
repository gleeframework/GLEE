(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only three rounds remaining, the negotiations are getting tight.  Alice is still above Bob's desired price. While there's a chance he could negotiate further, it's getting risky.  The likelihood of getting a deal at his ideal price is decreasing.  

Bob has a reliable alternative in John, who is offering the product at his maximum budget. Buying from John ensures he gets the product within his price range and avoids further negotiation risk."
