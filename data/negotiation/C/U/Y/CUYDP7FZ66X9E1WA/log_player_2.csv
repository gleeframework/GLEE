"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $140. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product looks great, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly in price, and $125 is a good deal, especially considering it's well below our $150 maximum and John's offer. There's not much point in continuing to negotiate for a potentially very small gain."
