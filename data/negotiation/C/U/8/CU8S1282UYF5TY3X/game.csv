"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,100,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. This is my final offer for now.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I still need to make a profit. I can see that you're willing to pay $875,000, but I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $875,000, which is $912,500. This is my next best offer.",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement on price. How about we split the difference between our last two offers? That would be $893,750.",893750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is a bit above your last offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",900000.0,Alice,7,
