Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. This is my final offer for now.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I still need to make a profit. I can see that you're willing to pay $875,000, but I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $875,000, which is $912,500. This is my next best offer.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is a bit above your last offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and while we could try to negotiate further, $900,000 is a good price that saves us $100,000 compared to John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
