Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum value of $150 as possible without risking losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160} 
```

I'm dropping the price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum.  I believe this is a fair compromise that might persuade Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to satisfy my goal of earning as much as possible.  I'm confident that John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'll sell to him."
