"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I'm trying to stick to a budget. How about $9,500? That's a significant jump from my last offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than I need to sell.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we both need to agree to make this work. How about $10,500? This would be my final offer, as I know I can always buy from John at $10,000.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and your willingness to go with John if we can't agree. Let's try to close this deal. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, but this is my final offer.  I'm confident you'll find this a good value compared to buying from John.",12000.0,Alice,7,
