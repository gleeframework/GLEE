Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it's also a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to sell it for that amount. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120. This is still a decent profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than his initial offer of $90. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as his first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already been through a couple of rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get more from Bob.  Since John is also willing to pay $100, I'm going to sell to him.  It's a guaranteed sale and I don't want to risk spending more time negotiating with Bob and possibly ending up with the same price."
