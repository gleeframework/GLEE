"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This price reflects the quality and rarity of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $12000 on this purchase. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12000 is significantly lower than the value I place on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to reduce the price to $17000. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still being fair to you.  Let me know if this offer works for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $17000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $15000. This would allow us to meet somewhere in the middle and respect both our needs.",15000.0,Bob,4,
