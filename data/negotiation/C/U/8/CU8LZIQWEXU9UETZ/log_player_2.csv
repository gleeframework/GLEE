Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12000 is significantly lower than the value I place on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to reduce the price to $17000. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still being fair to you.  Let me know if this offer works for you.
