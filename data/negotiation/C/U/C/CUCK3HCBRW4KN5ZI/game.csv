,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $180 is a bit too high for my budget. How about $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $160? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140. That's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $155? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",155.0,Alice,5,
