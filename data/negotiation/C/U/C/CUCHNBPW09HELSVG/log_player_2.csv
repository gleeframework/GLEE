{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice's offer is $95, so I will reject it.  I will try to get a better price in the next round."

I'm offering $85 for the product.  This is still a good deal for Alice as she values it at $120, and it's closer to my budget of $80."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $90 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still over my budget.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm offering $87 for the product.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $92 is still too high for my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm starting to run out of time and I don't want to risk her rejecting my next offer.  It's better to buy the product from John for $80, which is my maximum budget."
