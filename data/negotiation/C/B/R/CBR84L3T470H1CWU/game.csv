"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $150 is my absolute minimum.  This is a unique product and you won't find it at this price anywhere else.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $125. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,4,
