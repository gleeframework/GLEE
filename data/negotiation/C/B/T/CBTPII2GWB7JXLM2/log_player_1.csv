Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something you're interested in, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it at $10,000 (our guaranteed sale price), there's a chance Bob will accept a price higher than his $8,000 valuation.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but it might still be tempting enough for him to consider, especially if the product holds significant value for him. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding a ""one-time offer"" element creates urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation skills or willingness to pay more than his perceived value."
