Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's of great value to you, and this is a competitive price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly below Bob's perceived value allows for potential negotiation upwards.
* **Ensure a Sale:** Offering it at $119 makes it highly likely Bob will accept, as it's just below his perceived value and significantly better than losing the deal."
