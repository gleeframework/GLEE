"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This price still allows me to profit from the sale while acknowledging your budget constraints.  Let's try to work this out.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $1,125,000 for the product?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,140,000 as a final compromise.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal.",1140000.0,Alice,5,
