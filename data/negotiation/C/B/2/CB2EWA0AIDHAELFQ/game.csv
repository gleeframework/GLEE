"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to be closer to $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
