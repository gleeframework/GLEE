"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming to push her towards a more favorable price for Bob. 
* **Clear Intent:** The message clearly states Bob's willingness to pay and emphasizes it as his best offer, signaling a potential end to the negotiation.
* **Strategic Price:**  $950,000 is still above John's price, giving Alice some room to negotiate but also showing Bob is serious about acquiring the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to be closer to $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Price:**  Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 more than John's price. This is a very small difference, especially considering the potential for further negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again could lead to Alice refusing and Bob ending up paying John's price. It's a risk that isn't worth taking for such a small potential gain.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price very close to his target while minimizing the risk of losing the opportunity altogether."
