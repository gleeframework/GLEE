"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $120 for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $115? Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? That's a fair price, and I'm eager to make a deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $85 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $100 to make this deal work.  Let's meet halfway and go with $100. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $90? That's my final offer.",90.0,Bob,6,
