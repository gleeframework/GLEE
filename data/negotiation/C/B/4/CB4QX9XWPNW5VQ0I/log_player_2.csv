"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $1,300,000.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still a good deal for her, as it's above her valuation of the product. This should open a dialogue and potentially lead to a quicker resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. You've already established that you're willing to pay more than her valuation, and she's willing to sell for less than your maximum.  By continuing to counteroffer, you can likely achieve a price closer to $1,250,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,260,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small but meaningful step closer to your ideal price. It shows Alice you're serious about negotiating while still being within a reasonable range for her. The goal is to find a compromise that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,270,000, which is only $20,000 more than your last counteroffer.  While you might be able to get a slightly lower price with more rounds of negotiation, it's important to consider the time investment and potential risk. Accepting the offer here allows you to secure the product at a good price without risking losing it to another buyer or running out of time."
