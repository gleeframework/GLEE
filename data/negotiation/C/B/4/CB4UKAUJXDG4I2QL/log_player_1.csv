{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen to offer a price that is higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  However, it's important to consider:

* **Bob's likely budget:** If you have any idea about Bob's financial situation, adjust the price accordingly.
* **The product's perceived value:**  Is it something that's in high demand, or is it a niche product?  This will influence how high you can go.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I believe I can get a better deal with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $18,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. How about we split the difference and settle on $19,000? I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 19000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $17500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's lower than I'd initially hoped for, it's still above my minimum of $15,000 and closer to my desired price than John's offer.  It's important to recognize that continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
