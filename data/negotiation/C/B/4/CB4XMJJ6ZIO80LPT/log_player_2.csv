"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, Alice's offer of $9,500 is still too close to his maximum limit. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to make a deal. 
* **Alternative option:**  Bob can always buy from John for $10,000, but it's better to try and get a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. It's important to show Alice that Bob is serious about buying but also wants a good deal.
* **Fair Price:**  $8,500 is still a good price for Bob as it's lower than his maximum, and it's likely within Alice's range, given her minimum is $8,000. 
* **Negotiation Tactic:** This counteroffer sets the stage for further bargaining. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob has the option to make a smaller counteroffer, potentially leading to a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, $9,000 is still more than Bob wants to pay. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob has successfully gotten Alice to lower her price, indicating further room for bargaining. There's a strong chance Alice might be willing to go even lower to close the deal.
* **Alternative option:**  While John's offer is higher, Bob wants to explore all options to save as much money as possible. 

**Next Steps:** Bob will counteroffer with a lower price, aiming to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer proposes a middle ground between Alice's offer and Bob's previous one, showing a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Reasonable Price:** $8,750 is a price that's still within Bob's budget and allows for some negotiation flexibility. 
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the desire to ""finalize the deal,""  subtly suggesting that Bob is serious about buying but might consider other options if they can't reach an agreement."
