"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
