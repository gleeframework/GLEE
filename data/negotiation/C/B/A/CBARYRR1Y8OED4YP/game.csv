"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us and still allows me to earn a fair profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks again for being flexible.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000. This price is still a good deal for you, considering your value for the product, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal!",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,075,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $1,087,500 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",1087500.0,Alice,5,
