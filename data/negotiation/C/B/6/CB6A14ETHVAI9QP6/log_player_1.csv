"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product looks great but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a better price than Bob's offer.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still have a chance to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,000? That's my absolute top price. If it's not acceptable, I might have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. I'm happy to sell to him at that price."
