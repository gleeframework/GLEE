"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, the product's inherent worth and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. This offer reflects a balance between its value and our mutual desire to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, the price is still too high for Bob.  He's aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000, and John is offering that price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice, potentially getting closer to his target price. It also keeps the option to buy from John open if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,120,000 is still outside my budget. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need to stick to my range. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your constraints, and I want to make this work. Let's settle this at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target price, but it's still above his desired $1,000,000 limit.  Bob should continue negotiating and see if he can push for a lower price.  There are still a few rounds left, so there's time to try and get a better deal. He also has the option to buy from John if negotiations with Alice break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000, but that's my absolute limit.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1090000}
