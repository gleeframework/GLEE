"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could go up to $7,000, but that's my absolute limit.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I can offer it to you for $9,500. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is closer, but still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can offer it to you for $9,000, but I really need to make a sale happen soon. I'm starting to think about other opportunities, and I don't want to let this one slip away. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",9000.0,Alice,7,
