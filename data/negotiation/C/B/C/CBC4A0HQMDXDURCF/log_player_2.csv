Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can offer it to you for $9,000, but I really need to make a sale happen soon. I'm starting to think about other opportunities, and I don't want to let this one slip away. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure to sell but is unlikely to go much lower than $9,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it's no longer worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice. You've gained valuable information about her bottom line, and it's time to cut your losses and secure the product at your target price."
