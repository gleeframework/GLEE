"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can work towards a price that better suits both of our budgets. How about $950,000 for the product? This still allows you to make a good profit while keeping the cost reasonable for me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant discount for you and still allows me to get a fair price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product and the need for a fair price. Considering your latest offer, I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a compromise. This price still provides you with a good profit margin while staying within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. It's a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a better price than I could get from another buyer. Let's make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your patience and flexibility during this negotiation. I understand your position, and I am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,125,000 as a final offer? This price allows us both to benefit from the transaction without straining our respective budgets.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
