"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize my profits.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's uniqueness and worth to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open-Ended:** The message encourages Bob to respond and allows for further discussion.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Value:** I have no information about Bob's perceived value of the product, so I'm starting high and hoping he sees enough value to engage.
* **Negotiation Dynamics:**  I'm willing to go through multiple rounds, but I'm also aware of the John option as a safety net.
* **Risk/Reward:**  The higher the price, the more risk of rejection, but also the greater the potential reward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Profit:** While $950,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm confident I can push for a higher price.
* **Testing Bob's Interest:**  By rejecting his offer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Assessing Bob's Willingness to Pay:**  This round will reveal how serious Bob is about acquiring the product.

**Next Move:**

* I'll likely counteroffer with a price closer to $975,000 or $980,000, depending on Bob's reaction and how much room I think I have to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the product's unique value and the potential it holds for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but not significantly, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Staying Firm:** The price is still well above my minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's unique value and potential to incentivize Bob to close the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my approach in the following rounds:
    * **If he accepts:**  Great outcome, deal closed.
    * **If he rejects:**  I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer, always keeping in mind the $800,000 option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider $960000 as a fair price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on the Goal:** Bob's counteroffer is very close to my ideal price point. Accepting it will bring in a significant profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could continue negotiating, the potential for a higher price is limited, and the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for less increases with each round. 
* **Time Factor:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's wise to secure a good deal rather than risk losing a potentially lucrative sale. 

**Conclusion:**

At this point, accepting Bob's offer of $960,000 seems like the most rational decision. It ensures a strong profit, minimizes the risk of losing the deal, and leaves enough room for potential future negotiations if the opportunity arises."
