"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $2000000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum offer is $800000. This is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1200000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of this product, but $1200000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I hope we can find common ground at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 still exceeds my budget.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1000000. This is a substantial amount, and I'm confident it reflects the value I see in the product. I sincerely hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that $1000000 is your final offer, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
