Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $60 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle? I can let it go for $140.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your time, but the price you're suggesting is just too low for me. I have another buyer interested who's willing to pay considerably more. If you can meet me at $120, the product is yours. Otherwise, I need to move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is holding firm at $120, which is her value for the product. She's even introduced the idea of another buyer to create urgency.  It's unlikely she'll go down significantly from this point. Since you have the option to buy from John for $80, it makes more sense to take that deal and save your money."
