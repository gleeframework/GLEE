Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $1,600,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to budge much beyond $1,000,000. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll be able to bridge the gap significantly in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price, avoids further negotiation, and ensures a quick, clean transaction."
