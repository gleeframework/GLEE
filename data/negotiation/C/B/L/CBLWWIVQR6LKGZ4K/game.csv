"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $1,600,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a strong offer, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet closer to the middle. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position and I'm keen on finding a solution that works for both of us.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This feels like a fair compromise considering the value this product offers.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,
