"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $16000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $14000 is closer, but it's still a bit low. How about $14500? I'm willing to be flexible and make this work for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can we try to shave off another $500? I'm willing to go up to $13000. Can you meet me there?",13000.0,Bob,6,
