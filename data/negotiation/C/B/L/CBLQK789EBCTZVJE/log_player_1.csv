"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe it can be incredibly valuable to your business.  I'm starting with an offer of $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. Selling to John for $800,000 is not ideal, as it's my absolute minimum, and I can still improve on that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my desired price point.  I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price.  Selling to John at this point would mean I'm settling for my absolute minimum, and I'm not willing to do that if there's still a chance of getting a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our positions."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price,  Bob's offer is within a reasonable range, and I'm running out of time.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a price above my absolute minimum and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for $800,000."
