"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000. Can you consider this price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our positions.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
