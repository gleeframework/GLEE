Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $100. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $105 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to pay $100 for the product, which is slightly above its value to me and closer to your original valuation. This seems to be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum price, and it's the same amount I could get from John.  I'll accept the offer and close the deal."
