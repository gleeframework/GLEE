**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice is offering $7,600.  Continuing to negotiate aggressively risks her withdrawing from the deal altogether, forcing you to buy from John at $8,000. Accepting the $7,600 offer secures a savings of $400 compared to John's price and avoids the risk of missing out on a deal."
