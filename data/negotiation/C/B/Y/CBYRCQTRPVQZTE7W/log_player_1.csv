Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm emphasizing the value for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I can move to John, who's willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.**  I value the product at $12,000 and cannot afford to sell it for $6,000. 
* **Counteroffering is a better option than selling to John immediately.**  While John offers my minimum price, I have room to potentially negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round. 
* **It's worth trying to meet somewhere in the middle.** I may be able to get a price closer to my desired range if I counteroffer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell the product for $8,000.  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer of $8,000 is a compromise between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $6,000. 
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" for both of us, making the negotiation feel more cooperative.
* **Still above my minimum:** $8,000 is still above my minimum price of $12,000, allowing me to potentially gain more.
* **Leaving room for a final negotiation:** This counteroffer invites Bob to respond, hopefully reaching a final agreement."
