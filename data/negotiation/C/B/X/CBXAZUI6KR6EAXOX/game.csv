"Bob, I'm offering you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that I know will be incredibly valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's still very beneficial for both of us.  I'm asking for $1,200,000. This represents a significant saving for you while still allowing me to achieve a fair profit.  Consider it a win-win! Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
