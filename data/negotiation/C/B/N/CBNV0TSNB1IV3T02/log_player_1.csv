Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, as I don't know Bob's value for the product. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my potential profit.
* **Positive Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared for Bob to counter-offer, as the negotiation process will likely involve some back and forth. 

**Important Note:** I'm aware that I can always go to John for $1,500,000, but I'm aiming for a higher price. The next rounds will depend on Bob's response and my assessment of his potential interest and bargaining power."

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's interest in the product and his counteroffer show he's willing to negotiate. I believe I can push for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Negotiation:** Continuing the negotiation allows me to explore Bob's true valuation and potentially close a deal closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price between $1,800,000 and $2,000,000. I'll need to carefully consider my counter-offer based on Bob's willingness to negotiate and the remaining rounds."
