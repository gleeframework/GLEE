Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This offer represents a significant profit for me, but it also leaves room for negotiation with Bob, who values the product higher.  I believe this is a good starting point to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a good amount, it's still below my desired profit margin. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I believe $1,100,000 is still a fair price, considering the value Bob places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired profit margin, it's still not quite there. I'll risk one more round of negotiation with Bob and counter his offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant profit for me, but also acknowledges Bob's bargaining position. It's a final attempt to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is not enough for me to accept.  I have been through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely that Bob will go higher. While I would prefer to secure a higher price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out entirely. Selling to John guarantees me a profit, albeit a lower one."
