"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $950,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm proposing a new price of $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $850,000. I'm proposing a new price of $875,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference one last time. I'm offering $862,500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",862500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $862,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $870,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",870000.0,Alice,7,
