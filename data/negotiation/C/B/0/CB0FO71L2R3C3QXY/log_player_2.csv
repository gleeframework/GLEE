"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price.  $950,000 is still too high, and you have room to try and bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $950,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm proposing a new price of $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your target. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $850,000. I'm proposing a new price of $875,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$875,000 is still a bit more than you're willing to pay, and you're closer to your target with John's offer.  It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to drop a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference one last time. I'm offering $862,500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 862500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $862,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $870,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You're getting closer to your target price, but Alice isn't budging much. Since you only have 3 rounds left, it's better to go with John's offer and save yourself the potential of losing more time and not getting a better price."
