"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it!  $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $100. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'm going to have to look at other options.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already invested a lot in this product, and I'm not willing to sell it to you for less than $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $5. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
