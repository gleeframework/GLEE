{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,500,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident that this product will generate substantial returns for your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This initial offer is a starting point. It's high, but not unreasonably so, considering my minimum value is $1,000,000. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I'll be watching his response closely and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but it shows he's interested. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to facilitate a deal. This price still reflects the value and potential of this unique offering. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset to your business. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, his offer is still below my desired price. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm also starting to consider selling to John if this negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory conclusion."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest. To find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a very fair price considering the unique value and potential of this product. I truly believe it will be a valuable addition to your business. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm trying to bridge the gap between my minimum and Bob's offer. This counteroffer is a significant compromise, and if Bob doesn't accept, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to pay $1280000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This negotiation has gone on for several rounds, and while Bob is getting closer to my desired price, his offer is still below my minimum. I've already made significant concessions.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, ensuring a sale is more important at this point."
