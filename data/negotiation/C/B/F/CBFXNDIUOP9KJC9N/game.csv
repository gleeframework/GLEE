"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1300000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1600000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still slightly higher than my budget.  I'm ready to close the deal at $1450000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $1550000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, and I'm willing to go a little higher.  How about $1525000? This is a very fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1525000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not convinced that $1525000 is the best deal for me. I can do $1550000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
