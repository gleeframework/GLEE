"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value the product brings to your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
