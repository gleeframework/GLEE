{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone by highlighting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $90. I think that's a fair price considering the product is worth $120 to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you consider $95? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll still be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your original offer and my initial counteroffer. Would you consider $92.50? That's the best I can do, and I hope it's still a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm confident that I can make a decent profit. Accepting his offer is the best option, as it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the next round."
