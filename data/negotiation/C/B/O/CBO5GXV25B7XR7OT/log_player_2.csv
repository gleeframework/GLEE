{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can always go to John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming to be significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows my intent to negotiate seriously and gives me room to potentially compromise later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. I'm still willing to negotiate further to try and get a better price.  While John's offer is a safety net, I'm not ready to buy from him yet as I believe I can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise.  $1,150,000 is still a good deal for me, but closer to Alice's price, signaling that I'm serious about buying from her.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,165,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,165,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,165,000 is within my budget and represents a good deal. It's lower than John's price and likely closer to Alice's bottom line.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer and potentially driving up the price is high. Accepting this offer is the best option for securing a good deal within my budget."
