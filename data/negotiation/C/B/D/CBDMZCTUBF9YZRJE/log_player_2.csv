"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for a price that I believe will be mutually beneficial.  It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your operations. Let's discuss the details further.  I'm willing to negotiate a fair price, but it will be no less than $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, meaning there's no room for negotiation.  Since John is also willing to sell at the same price, you're better off buying from John. You'll get the same product at the same price, and there's no risk of losing the opportunity if you reject Alice's offer."
