"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8200 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $8200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $8200. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",8200.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $8200, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $8400. This is a small concession from my original price, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $8400 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $8300, which is a fair compromise. I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",8300.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're getting close to your target price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $8300. I'm willing to make another small concession and offer it to you for $8250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8250.0,Alice,7,
