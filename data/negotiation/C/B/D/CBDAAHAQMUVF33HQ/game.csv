"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and still provides you with value. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still leaves me with a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to counter with $9,750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $9,750 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10,125. This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.  Let's make this deal happen!",10125.0,Alice,5,
