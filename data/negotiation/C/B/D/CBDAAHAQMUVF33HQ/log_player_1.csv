{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and still provides you with value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you still make a profit.
* **It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation:**  It's likely Bob will counteroffer, and this gives you room to negotiate.

Remember, you can always choose to sell to John if negotiations with Bob don't work out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum value of $12,000. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better price.  You can counteroffer and try to meet in the middle, but you should aim for a price closer to $10,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still leaves me with a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to counter with $9,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still too low.  You've already compromised significantly. It's worth seeing if you can squeeze out a slightly higher price by counteroffering again."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $9,750 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10,125. This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10125}
