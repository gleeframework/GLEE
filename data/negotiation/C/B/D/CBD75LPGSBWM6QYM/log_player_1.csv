Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a fair price that's significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110.  This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I believe Bob will recognize the value and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my minimum, but I don't think I can push him any higher. To ensure I don't lose out completely, I'll sell to John for $80.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's better than risking further negotiation and getting nothing at all."
