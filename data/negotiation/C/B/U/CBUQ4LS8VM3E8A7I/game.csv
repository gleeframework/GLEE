"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! This product is interesting to me, but $800,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $700,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still a bit away. How about $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
