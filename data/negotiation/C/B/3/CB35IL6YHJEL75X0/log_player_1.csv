Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
