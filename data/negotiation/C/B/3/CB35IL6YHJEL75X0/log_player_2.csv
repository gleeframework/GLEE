"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is better than John's price of $1,500,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I have a strong belief in the product's value. I could meet you halfway - would $1,350,000 be agreeable? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $1,350,000 is less than Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000.
* **It's a good deal compared to John's price:**  Bob saves $150,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* **Further negotiation might not be worthwhile:** While Bob could try to lower the price further, there's a risk Alice might reject his counteroffer. The difference between $1,350,000 and a potential lower price might not be worth the risk of losing the deal."
