Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You value the product at $1,000,000 (meaning you won't sell for less).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, you hold a strong position.  You can aim high with Bob, knowing you have a safety net.  However, greed could backfire. If you ask for too much, Bob will refuse, and you'll get your minimum from John.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $950,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value, but it's still within a potentially negotiable range.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  This offer allows Bob to counter-offer if he's highly interested, giving you room to potentially make even more.
* **Protects Your Bottom Line:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing any potential profit, as you'll sell to John for your desired amount. 

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response."
