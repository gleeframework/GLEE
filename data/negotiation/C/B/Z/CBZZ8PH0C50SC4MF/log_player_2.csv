"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than $150, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further.  There are 9 rounds left, giving Bob ample time to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to come down to $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a moderate counteroffer, aiming to show Alice he's serious about buying but still wants a better deal. The $10 reduction is a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $135. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he's still within the first few rounds and has plenty of time to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further.  Bob can use the remaining rounds to try to push the price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for, though.  How about $132?  That's a good compromise for both of us, and it's closer to what I can afford right now."", ""product_price"": 132}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, aiming for a price that's a good compromise while still saving as much money as possible. He's making a smaller reduction this round, demonstrating he's serious but also trying to keep the negotiations moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $137? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm getting closer to my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is getting close to his goal of a price below $140. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might get frustrated and refuse to budge, forcing him to buy from John.  Accepting the offer at $137 secures a good price and avoids any potential for a deal breakdown."
