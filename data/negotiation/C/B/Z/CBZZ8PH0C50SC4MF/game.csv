"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to come down to $130?",130.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for, though.  How about $132?  That's a good compromise for both of us, and it's closer to what I can afford right now.",132.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $137? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm getting closer to my minimum price.",137.0,Alice,5,
