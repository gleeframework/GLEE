"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $11,250? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, I am serious about this purchase! I'm willing to budge a little more. Would you consider $11,100? It seems like we're getting close.",11100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,150, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price for a product of this value, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11150.0,Alice,7,
