"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $17,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This price still reflects the value I'm placing on the product, but it also shows I'm flexible and open to finding a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $13,250 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could you do $12,800? I feel like that's a reasonable compromise.",12800.0,Bob,6,
