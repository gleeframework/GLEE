,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $95? That's a fair price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I can do $105, and that's as low as I can go.",105.0,Alice,5,
