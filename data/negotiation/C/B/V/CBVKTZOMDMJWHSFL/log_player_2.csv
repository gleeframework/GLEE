"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product at my maximum price. There's no point in negotiating further, as I won't get a better price from John."
