{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to go above his $932,000 offer. We've been steadily converging, but at this point, the potential gain from continuing to negotiate with Bob is outweighed by the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It makes more financial sense to cut off the negotiation and sell to John."
