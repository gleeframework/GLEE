Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it would help me out a lot. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so $100 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You are willing to accept no less than $120, so you have room to negotiate if needed.
* **It's a fair offer:**  $100 is a price that gives both parties something. You get a profit, and Bob gets a good deal. 

If Bob rejects, you have a backup buyer (John) who will pay your minimum acceptable price."
