"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but considering its value to you, I'm willing to start the negotiation at $140. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our $120 target.  We'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This tactic might seem aggressive, but it gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying below our $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. Considering the value it holds, I believe we can find a fair price. How about $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price. Let's see if we can negotiate a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice.  Could you do $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

We're inching closer to our limit while still leaving ourselves some wiggle room.  This offer also keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Bob. I think we can agree on $115 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could try to push for a lower price, Alice's offer of $115 is within our $120 budget. It's a good deal, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the product or having to buy it for $120 from John."
