,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $150. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $140? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's find a solution we can both agree on.",140.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with $145. I'm willing to pay $140, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",140.0,Bob,8,
