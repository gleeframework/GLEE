"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm interested in the product, but  $10,000 would be a more reasonable starting point for me.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find some middle ground.  Would you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
