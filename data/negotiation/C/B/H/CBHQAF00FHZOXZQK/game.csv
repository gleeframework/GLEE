"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $10,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",10500.0,Alice,5,
