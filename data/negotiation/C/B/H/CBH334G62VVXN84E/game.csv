"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see the value, $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1050000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $1150000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1150000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $1100000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and get this deal done.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1100000 is still a bit lower than my initial target, but I'm willing to be flexible. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a new offer of $1125000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
