(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000 from Alice. It's worth rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer to see if you can get a better deal.  You have room to negotiate since you're willing to pay up to $15,000 and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than what the product is worth to her. This gives Alice incentive to negotiate while still leaving room for you to potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you want to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further. You have room to go lower with your counteroffer and still get a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing Alice that you are willing to negotiate but still trying to get a lower price than her counteroffer.  It keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Alice's offer of $11,000 is the best you've gotten from her. You're willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, so accepting her offer is the best choice. You'll save $4,000 compared to buying from John. While you could keep negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might get frustrated and walk away, leaving you to buy from John.  It's better to secure the deal at a reasonable price."
