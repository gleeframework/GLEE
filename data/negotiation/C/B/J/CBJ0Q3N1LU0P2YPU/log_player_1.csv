"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a significant improvement from his initial rejection, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering your original asking price and my budget. If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to accept it yet.  I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more."
