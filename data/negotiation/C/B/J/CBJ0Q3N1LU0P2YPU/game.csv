"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can work something out.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering your original asking price and my budget. If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.
