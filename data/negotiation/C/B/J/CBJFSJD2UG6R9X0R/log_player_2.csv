"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting very close to my bottom line. I can do $8,500, but that's absolutely as low as I can go. This offer stands for today only. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000.  You have the option to buy from John at your target price, so it's best to take the guaranteed deal rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
