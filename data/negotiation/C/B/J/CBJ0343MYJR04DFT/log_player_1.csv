Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so starting at $11,500 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower price than Bob's maximum might make him feel like he's getting a deal, increasing the chance of acceptance. 
* **Backup Option:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so there's less risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob."
