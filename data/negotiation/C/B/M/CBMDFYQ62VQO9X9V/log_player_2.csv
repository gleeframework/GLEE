# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $12,000 is the absolute lowest I could go, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,000 is close, but to make this work for me, I'd need it to be at least $14,000.  This is my final offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make this work for you, but $14,000 is still stretching my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 13500}
