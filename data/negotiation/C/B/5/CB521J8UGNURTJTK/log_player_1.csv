Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a high price, but I also want to leave room for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. It's a fair price considering Bob's low offer, and it leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still lower than what John is offering. I'm confident that I can find a better deal, and selling to John guarantees me a solid profit."
