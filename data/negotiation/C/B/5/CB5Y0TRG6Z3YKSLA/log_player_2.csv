"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I know it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting her offer opens up the possibility of her lowering the price, and even if she doesn't, you're not losing out."
