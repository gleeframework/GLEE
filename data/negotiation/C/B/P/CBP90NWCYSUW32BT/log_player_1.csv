Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets the product for $300,000 less than its value to him.
    * I earn a $100,000 premium compared to selling to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly."
