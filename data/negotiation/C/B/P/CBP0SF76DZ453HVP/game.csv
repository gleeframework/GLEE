"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. Let's get started with an opening offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is fair and reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. Let's reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm hoping we can find common ground at this price.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach a deal.  $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I place on the product. Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is still a discount from my initial offer. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're close but $920,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $890,000 for the product. This price is fair and allows us both to close this deal.  Let's make this happen.",890000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $890,000. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, which is a compromise that still brings me closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",915000.0,Alice,9,
