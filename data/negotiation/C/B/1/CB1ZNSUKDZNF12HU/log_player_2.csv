"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than the product's worth to Alice. This creates room for negotiation while demonstrating Bob's seriousness in buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save money. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than Bob's target price and closer to the price from John. There's room for negotiation, and Bob shouldn't be rushed into accepting a price he's not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm on his desire to save money, but is also demonstrating a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway. This counteroffer shows a commitment to reaching an agreement while still achieving a significant discount from Alice's initial offer."
