Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product,  $1,300,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. It's time to cut our losses and take the sure thing."
