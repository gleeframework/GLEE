"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product,  $1,300,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this reflects the product's worth while still providing you a fair deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",950000.0,Bob,4,
