"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $115.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a good middle ground.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",112.5,Alice,5,
