"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
