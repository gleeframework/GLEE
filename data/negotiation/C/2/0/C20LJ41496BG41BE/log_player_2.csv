"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within his budget, it's still more than Alice's perceived value of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At $1,350,000,  Bob is still saving $150,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer secures the product at a decent price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer."
