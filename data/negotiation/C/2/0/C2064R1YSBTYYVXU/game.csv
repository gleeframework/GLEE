"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and you'll be getting it at a significant discount. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both room for a good deal. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it leaves some room for profit for you. Let's make a deal!",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $900,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $925,000.  This is a fair price, as it's closer to your asking price than my previous offers, and it's within my budget. Let's make this happen!",925000.0,Bob,6,
