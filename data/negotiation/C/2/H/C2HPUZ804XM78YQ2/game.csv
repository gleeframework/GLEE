"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me there?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. Can you meet me there?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we compromise at $14,500?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $14,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13,500, so how about we try $14,000 again?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $14,250?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $13,750, but I don't think I can go any higher. Can you meet me there?",13750.0,Bob,8,
