"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer matches the product's worth to you, there's no harm in trying to get a better price. You can reject her offer and see if she's willing to come down. If not, you can always buy from John at the same price."
