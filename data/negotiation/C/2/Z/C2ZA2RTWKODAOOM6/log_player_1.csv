Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's value, Alice provides a reason for her initial high price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal to Bob that Alice is open to negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price. 

**Important:**  While Alice has a backup buyer, it's still in her best interest to try and get the highest price possible from Bob.  This offer balances ambition with a willingness to negotiate."
