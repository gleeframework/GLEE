"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $12,500. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
