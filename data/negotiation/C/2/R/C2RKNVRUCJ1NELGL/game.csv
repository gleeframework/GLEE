"Alice, I appreciate your offer. This product sounds interesting, but $900000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a good middle ground that still reflects the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $800000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but I think it's still a good value for the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
