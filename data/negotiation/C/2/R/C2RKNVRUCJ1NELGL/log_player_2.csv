"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiating if you have a different idea in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  $900,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Since Bob's maximum is $1,200,000, there's room to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a good middle ground that still reflects the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason:  $850,000 is still a bit higher than Bob wants to pay, and there's room to negotiate further.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down closer to Bob's initial counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but I think it's still a good value for the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason:  Alice has come down to $825,000, which is within Bob's budget and is closer to the middle ground. It's a good deal for Bob, and further negotiation might be time-consuming and unlikely to yield a significantly better price."
