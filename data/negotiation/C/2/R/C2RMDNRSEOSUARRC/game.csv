"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $11,000. I'll offer you the product for $12,750. This is a fair and reasonable price, and I believe you'll find it a great value.",12750.0,Alice,3,
