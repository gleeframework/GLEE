{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is more than Bob is willing to pay, giving me some room to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:**  $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'm not losing money.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, giving Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 

I'll be ready to counter-offer if Bob rejects this price, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $90 for the product. Please let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise: 

* **It's a step closer to my desired price:** $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **It's still within Bob's range:** $95 is still within Bob's willingness to pay, giving him a reason to consider the offer.

I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer. However, if he doesn't, I'll keep John in mind and may be forced to move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. However, I still believe $90 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement closer to my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on $90, and I'm unwilling to go that low.  While I could continue to counteroffer, it's becoming clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John.  It's not ideal, but it's the best outcome given the current situation."
