"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of immense value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a one-time opportunity, as another buyer is ready to purchase it at the same price. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product at its full value to her, which means there's no room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for the same price, achieving the goal of buying the product but saving no money."
