"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $950000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $820000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer?",820000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $820000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $880000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, $880000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. I'm thinking more along the lines of $840000. Can you consider this offer?",840000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your desire to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $840000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $860000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",860000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $860000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm not overpaying. I'm thinking more along the lines of $810000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",810000.0,Bob,8,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $830000 is still a bit too high for me. I've made it clear that I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $800000. I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I'm going to go talk to John about buying the product from him for $800000. I wish you the best of luck finding a buyer who is willing to pay your price.",800000.0,Bob,10,
