I'm increasing my offer to $800,000, which is right in the middle of Alice's last offer and my previous one. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm also not willing to go much higher.  It's a strong final attempt before considering John's offer."

Alice's offer is higher than my target price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation. I'm not confident I can get her to go lower. It's more advantageous to buy from John for $1,200,000 and secure the product, rather than risk failing to reach an agreement with Alice."
