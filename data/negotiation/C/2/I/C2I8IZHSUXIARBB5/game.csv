"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to go a bit lower, but $130 is still too far off for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $137.50? This is a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Alice,5,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $135?,135.0,Bob,6,
