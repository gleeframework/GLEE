Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm offering a price of $155, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price.  This should keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 152}
```

I'm offering a price of $152. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still above Bob's last offer. I hope this will entice Bob to accept the deal, as we are now very close to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $148. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $148
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are running out of time and Bob's offers are still not reaching my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price, it's better to secure a sale at this point. I'll sell to John for $150."
