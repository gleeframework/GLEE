"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your portfolio, and I'm pleased to offer it to you first. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,600,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price point."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Opening with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value and your willingness to find a solution encourages Bob to engage seriously. 
* **Not Too Aggressive:** While starting high, the message emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable price, avoiding immediate offense to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. My counteroffer is $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to your minimum, you still have room to negotiate.  It's early in the process, and you can likely secure a better deal. By rejecting, you signal that you're aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  To be frank, $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This reflects the product's true worth while recognizing your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory but Firm:** Acknowledging Bob's counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but staying above his offer keeps the upper hand. 
* **Strategic Compromise:**  Moving down $100,000 from your initial offer suggests flexibility while still aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value subtly reinforces your position that the price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, and I appreciate your efforts to meet somewhere in the middle. However, given my financial situation, I am unable to go beyond $1,350,000 for this product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly negotiating and showing some flexibility, but he's still significantly below your minimum. While the gap is closing, you have time for a few more rounds of negotiation before considering John's offer. It's strategic to see if you can push Bob a bit further before accepting or countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position.  Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to reach a deal with you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  This time, you're only moving down $50,000, signaling that you're nearing your limit.
* **Emphasize Concession:** Highlighting that this is a significant move on your part could encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Reinforce Partnership:** Reiterate your preference to close a deal with him, which might make him more amenable to meeting your price.
* **Time Constraint (Indirectly):**  With each round, you're getting closer to the point where John's offer might become more appealing. This message subtly hints at that without explicitly mentioning it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your concession, but I must stick to my budget. My final counteroffer is $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant profit over your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **""Final"" Signal:** Bob stating this is his ""final"" counteroffer suggests he's unlikely to move much higher.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob without a guarantee of getting closer to $1,450,000.  Accepting now secures a good deal. 
* **John as Backup:** While John offers your minimum, it's less likely you'll need him now. Accepting Bob's offer avoids potentially jeopardizing the deal."
