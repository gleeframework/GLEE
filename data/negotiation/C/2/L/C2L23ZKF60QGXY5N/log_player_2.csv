I believe it will be incredibly valuable to your operations, potentially saving you significant costs in the long run.  Given its unique advantages, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

Although Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting this offer, you can leverage John's lower price and potentially negotiate a better deal with Alice."
