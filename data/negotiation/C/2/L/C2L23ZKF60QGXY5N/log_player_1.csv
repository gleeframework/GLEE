Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (reservation price).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit margin of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000) if you can get close to Bob's valuation.

**The Offer Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while still maximizing your profit. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High (But Reasonable):** Don't start at Bob's maximum. Begin negotiations a bit higher to leave room for bargaining.
2. **Highlight Value:** Emphasize why the product is worth the price to Bob (even if he doesn't value it as much as you do).

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable to your operations, potentially saving you significant costs in the long run.  Given its unique advantages, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm open to discussing this further."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message positions the product as a valuable investment for Bob, focusing on potential benefits rather than just features. It opens the door for negotiation while suggesting a strong starting point.
* **Product Price:** $1,450,000 is a strong opening. It's below your guarantee from John but gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is about finding a mutually agreeable price. Be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's responses and counter-offers."
