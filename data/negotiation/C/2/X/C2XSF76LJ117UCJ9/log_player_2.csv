"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. I'm asking $100 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price in a counter-offer, saving you even more money."
