"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  This offer leaves room for me to adjust the price if needed, and it sets the stage for potential counteroffers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is my best offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum of $12,000, it's still significantly lower.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Exploring options:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round, potentially getting closer to my goal of $12,000.
* **Not yet at the breaking point:**  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I still believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price higher than his initial counter.  This demonstrates flexibility while also protecting my profit margin.
* **Emphasize the value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my asking price and encourage Bob to see the value in closing the deal.
* **Focus on finding a solution:**  I'm using positive language (""Let's see if we can reach an agreement"") to maintain a collaborative tone and keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Strategic compromise:**  This counteroffer allows for potential further negotiation in the next round without risking losing the deal to John yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $9,000.  This is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired range, I'm still holding out for a better price. 
* **Strategic counteroffers:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price and potentially reach a deal closer to $10,000. 
* **Not ready to settle:** I'm not yet at the point where I'm willing to accept a price that's below my target, especially since John is offering $12,000. 
* **Evaluating risk vs. reward:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining leverage and keeping the option to sell to John open if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finally close this deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving the needle:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer while still staying above his initial counter. This demonstrates flexibility and shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Finding middle ground:** Splitting the difference suggests a fair and mutually beneficial solution, making the offer more appealing.
* **Encouraging closure:** Emphasizing ""closing the deal"" creates a sense of urgency and a positive outcome.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still leaving room for negotiation in the next round if necessary, but getting closer to my target.
* **Keeping John as a backup:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll still have the option to sell to John for $12,000."
