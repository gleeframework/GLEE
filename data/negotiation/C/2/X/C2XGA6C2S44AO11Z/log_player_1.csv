Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer.  Since you have a backup buyer, you can be a bit more aggressive. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start by highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""unique value.""
* **Justification:** You provide a reason for your price (""fair deal"") and emphasize the ""significant return on investment."" 
* **Leaving Room:** While aiming high, you leave some room for negotiation (Bob might counter-offer).
* **Alternative:** If you want to be more aggressive, you could start at $1,450,000. However, a slightly lower initial offer increases the likelihood of Bob accepting outright.

**Important Note:**  Bob's internal valuation of $1,500,000 is not something you would know in a real negotiation. This offer aims to secure a price significantly above your minimum while staying within a reasonable range of Bob's perceived value."
