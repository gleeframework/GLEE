Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,300,000. It's a significant opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects the value you'll gain. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,300,000, which is well above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message emphasizes the potential value for Bob, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Flexibility:** This price allows for negotiation, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price, allowing me to potentially secure a profitable sale.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John for my minimum desired price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.** Even though $900,000 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still far below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **I have a guaranteed backup option with John.** Selling to John ensures I get my desired price.
* **Negotiation room:** While I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I'm not completely closing the door. This allows for further negotiation and potentially reaching a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll gain. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident this price is fair. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial offer, but still staying significantly above Bob's price. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential benefits he'll gain, highlighting the value proposition.
* **Confidence:** The message expresses confidence in the price, aiming to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, but it's still above my minimum desired price, ensuring a profitable outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**
