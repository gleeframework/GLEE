,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll gain. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident this price is fair. Let's work together to make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
