"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,500. This is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find common ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $12,750. Can we meet at this price?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,250. This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $12,750. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer. I'll meet you at $12,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you accept this price?",12750.0,Bob,6,
