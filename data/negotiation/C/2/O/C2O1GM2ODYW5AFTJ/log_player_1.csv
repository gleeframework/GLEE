Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the asking price of $1,900,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1900000}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to aim significantly higher with Bob. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This high price acts as a gauge of Bob's interest and financial capacity. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. You can gradually lower the price, keeping John's offer as a safety net. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have any insight into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, passive), you can adjust your initial offer accordingly. 
* **The Product's Nature:**  If the product has a highly unique value proposition, it justifies a bolder initial price.

**This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while considering the security of your fallback option.**"
