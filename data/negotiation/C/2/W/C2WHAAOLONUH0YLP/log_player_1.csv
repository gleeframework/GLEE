Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant sum. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its potential value to you."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000,  trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a high price, but it leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 gain if the product's worth to him is realized. This makes the offer tempting while still netting me a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The message subtly hints at the existence of another buyer, creating a sense of urgency without explicitly revealing John's offer.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and leaving room to accept John's guaranteed offer if needed."
