"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $10,500? That's a fair compromise, and still gives you a great deal.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $10,000? I'm willing to pay the full value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
