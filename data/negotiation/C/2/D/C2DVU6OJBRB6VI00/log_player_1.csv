Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible, without going below your minimum ($150). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no need to drastically undervalue the product to Bob."
