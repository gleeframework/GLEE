"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $180. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me. $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $140? That's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $160, but I'm willing to go up to $155. If you're open to that, I think we can finalize this deal.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like where you're coming from, Bob! $155 is a great offer, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to go back to $165, which is a great compromise. It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for the value the product brings. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,
