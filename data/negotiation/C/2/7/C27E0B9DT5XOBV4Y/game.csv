"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $950000 falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and it's still a great price for you, given the product's value to you. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
