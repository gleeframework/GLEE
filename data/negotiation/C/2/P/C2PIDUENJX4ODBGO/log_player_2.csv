"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your purchase. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than what Bob would get from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for a lower price, saving $200,000."
