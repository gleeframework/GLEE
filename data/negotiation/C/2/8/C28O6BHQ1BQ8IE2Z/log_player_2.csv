Alice's offer:

I understand it's a bit higher than what you're willing to pay, but I think it's still a great value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value of the product to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Alice is unlikely to go below $10,500.  Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed lower price."
