"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I understand it's a bit higher than what you're willing to pay, but I think it's still a great value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
