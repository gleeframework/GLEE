"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I find the price a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. I believe this price represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment you'll gain.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I know the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise at $1,150,000 â€“ my final offer. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to see this deal go through.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
