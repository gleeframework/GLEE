"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my valuation. How about we aim for $850,000? I look forward to your response.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go that far below my asking price. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,025,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, and while I understand your position, I still believe we can find common ground. How about we aim for $975,000? I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us. Looking forward to your thoughts.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there. $975,000 is a step in the right direction, but I need a bit more to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal and make it happen. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
