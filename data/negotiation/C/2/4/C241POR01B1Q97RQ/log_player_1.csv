Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset and I believe this is a fair price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows that you're serious about a deal with Bob while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than what the product is worth to Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,100,000?  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John is offering, and it's close enough to your desired price that it's worth accepting.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely Bob won't budge much more."
