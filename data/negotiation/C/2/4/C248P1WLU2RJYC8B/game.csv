"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $130 to start. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me there?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit shy of $125. How about we meet at $115? I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a bit more reasonable for me.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I want to be fair.  $120 seems to be our sticking point.  How about this, I'll come down to $120, but only if you can close the deal right now.  This offer is off the table after this.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to buying the product at $120 right now. I'm willing to meet you at $118, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",118.0,Bob,6,
