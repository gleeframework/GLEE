"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us - a significant savings for you and a solid return for me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply not a feasible price for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer still gives you a significant saving compared to the market value, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the market value and allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to get the sense that we're not going to be able to find common ground.  I'm willing to go down to $950,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options. ",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're reaching your limit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $925,000.  This is a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired amount.  Let me know what you think. ",925000.0,Alice,7,
