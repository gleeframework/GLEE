"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us - a significant savings for you and a solid return for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're looking to pay no more than $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply not a feasible price for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer still gives you a significant saving compared to the market value, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above your budget.  You're determined to stay within your $800,000 limit, so rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the market value and allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get the sense that we're not going to be able to find common ground.  I'm willing to go down to $950,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're reaching your limit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $925,000.  This is a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired amount.  Let me know what you think.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, you are running out of rounds.  $925,000 is still over your budget, and you don't want to risk further negotiation.  Buying from John for $800,000 is the safest option to ensure you get the product within your budget."
