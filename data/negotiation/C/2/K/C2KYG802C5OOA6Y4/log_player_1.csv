"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's value of $80 but still allows room for negotiation. I want to see if he'll accept this offer, and if not, what his counteroffer will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $90 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum value of $120, I believe I can still get closer to that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. Based on my budget, I can consider purchasing the product for $90. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum value of $120, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer.  $90 is a good deal for me considering I could have sold to John for $120 but risked having to negotiate further with Bob and potentially losing the deal altogether."
