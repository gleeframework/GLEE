Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer of $14,000 is getting closer, but it's still higher than I'm comfortable with. I've reached my limit with the negotiations and I don't want to risk going further and potentially paying more.  I'm going to go with John's offer of $12,000."
