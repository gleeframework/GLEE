"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $12,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm firm on $13,000.  This is a fair price considering both our perspectives on the product's value.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $14,500. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there.  $14,500 is a bit too high for me.  How about $13,500?  That's a fair compromise, and I believe we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,
