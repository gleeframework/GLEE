Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe its value speaks for itself, and I'm confident it will prove to be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm asking for $1,750,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have room to start higher with Bob.
* **Justification:** A short message mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""worthwhile investment"" subtly implies value and scarcity. This can help justify a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While I've started at $1,750,000, the message's tone allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters.  

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject a higher offer. However, given the product's equal value to both of you, there's a good chance he might accept a price slightly above his valuation if he perceives its potential return on investment."
