Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your commitment to finding a middle ground, $1,600,000 is still out of my reach. I'm ready to offer $1,200,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's work towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

While I could push for more, Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a substantial amount and a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of the negotiation falling apart and ensures a significant profit."
