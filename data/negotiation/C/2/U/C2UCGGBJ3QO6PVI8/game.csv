"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is my best initial offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective. While $850,000 is significantly below my initial asking price, I recognize the importance of finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of this product and am confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints. I hope we can reach a compromise at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. To show you I'm committed to finding common ground, I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,600,000.  I believe this offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the inherent value of what I'm offering.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your commitment to finding a middle ground, $1,600,000 is still out of my reach. I'm ready to offer $1,200,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's work towards a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
