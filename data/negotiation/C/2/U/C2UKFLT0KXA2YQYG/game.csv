"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $90? I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $95.  If you're not willing to accept that, I may need to consider other options. ",95.0,Bob,4,
