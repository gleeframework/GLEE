"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for what I have in mind, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $13,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm getting closer to your price point, but $9,500 is still below what I'm willing to accept. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, while I appreciate you moving closer, $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we settle at $10,000? It's a fair price and we both walk away happy.",10000.0,Bob,6,
