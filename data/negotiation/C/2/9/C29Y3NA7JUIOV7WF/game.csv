"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a revised offer of $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,
