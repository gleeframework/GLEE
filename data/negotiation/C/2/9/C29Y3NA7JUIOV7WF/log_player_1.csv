{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation, but also want to maximize my profits. If he rejects, I can always lower the price slightly and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a revised offer of $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,500 is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
