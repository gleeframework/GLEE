Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're running out of time here.  I'm going to make my final offer: $1,350,000. This is a fair price that I'm confident will be beneficial for both of us. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer and she's unwilling to go lower.  While you could try another counteroffer, it's unlikely she'll budge significantly, and you'll risk losing the opportunity to buy from John for $1,000,000. You're better off securing the product at your target price, even if it means losing out on a potentially slightly better deal."
