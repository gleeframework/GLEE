"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also keeping John in mind as a potential buyer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting a sense that we're not too far apart.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'll counteroffer one last time before considering John."
