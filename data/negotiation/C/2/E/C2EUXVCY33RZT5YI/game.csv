"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I'm confident the product will be worth this investment for you. Let's find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
