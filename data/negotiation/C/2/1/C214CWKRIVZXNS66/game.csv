"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I also need to consider the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I've already met you at a price of $1150000 and you've countered at $1120000, which is still $30000 below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1140000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1140000.0,Alice,5,
