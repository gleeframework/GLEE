"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is higher than his maximum budget, and he can get the same product for $12,000 from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is what it's worth to me.  Let me know if you're open to this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can still get the product for his desired price from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. My final offer is $12,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product holds for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is clearly unwilling to drop below $13,000, which is still higher than Bob's budget. At this point, it's clear that further negotiation with Alice will likely be fruitless. John is offering the product for Bob's maximum budget, so it makes the most sense to buy from him."
