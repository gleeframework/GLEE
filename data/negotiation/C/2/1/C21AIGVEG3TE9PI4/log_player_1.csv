"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, I want to try and get closer to my ideal price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still leaves room for you to get a great deal, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Bob's offer is the same as what I can get from John, so I'll take it. It's a good deal, and it avoids the risk of further negotiations."
