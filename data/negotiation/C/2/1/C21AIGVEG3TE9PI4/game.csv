"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Given its value to you, I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still leaves room for you to get a great deal, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
