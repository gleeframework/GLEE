**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($500,000) between what Bob is willing to pay and your minimum acceptable price. This leaves Bob with a potential gain of $100,000, making the offer attractive to him while maximizing your profit."
