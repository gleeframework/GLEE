"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price.  Would you be interested in paying $14,000 for it?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, as her valuation is lower than her offer. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt her to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal.  If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000."
