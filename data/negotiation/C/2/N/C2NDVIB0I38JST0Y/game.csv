"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and features.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I appreciate your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $16,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
