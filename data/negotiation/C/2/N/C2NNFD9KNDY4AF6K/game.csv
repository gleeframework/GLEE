"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $15,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $20,000 represents the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  thanks again for your flexibility. $17,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit out of my range.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but  $16,000 is the absolute highest I can go right now.  What do you think?",16000.0,Bob,4,
