"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as buying from John. Since Bob's goal is to save money, there is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better deal from Alice in the future or find another seller with a lower price."
