"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and preferences. Given its unique features and the value it brings to users like yourself, we believe it's worth more than $8,000. Considering its market value and the benefits it offers, I propose to sell it to you for $10,000. This price reflects a fair compromise between its actual worth and your perceived value, allowing you to enjoy all its advantages without breaking the bank. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  Rejecting her offer keeps the door open for negotiation (she might come down in price), and if not, you're still securing the product at your target price."
