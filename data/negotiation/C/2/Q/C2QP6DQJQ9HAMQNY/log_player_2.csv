"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still offers you a great deal, considering the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth risking a worse deal. Buying from John for $1,200,000 guarantees the best price."
