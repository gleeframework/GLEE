"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum price. It makes sense to negotiate down, starting significantly lower than her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $5,000. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $5,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a low number, you aim to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired price range.  
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful but clearly communicates your budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $5,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  Alice's counteroffer is still $2,000 above your maximum price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to move down from $12,000 suggests there's flexibility in the price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You still have the option to buy from John at your target price, providing leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  I can go a bit higher, how about $6,500? That's a fair offer considering its age and the current market."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:**  The offer shows you're willing to negotiate by increasing your offer by $1,500.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason related to the product (e.g., ""age,"" ""market"") can make your offer seem more reasonable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is below your maximum budget, but closer to Alice's price, potentially leading to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $10,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's a fair offer considering the value this product provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has made it clear that $10,000 is her bottom line. 
* **Over Budget:**  Accepting Alice's offer would mean exceeding your $8,000 budget.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000, meeting your needs and saving you money. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take the guaranteed deal with John."
