"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This unique item holds immense value not only to us but also to you, as it is worth $1,200,000 to you personally. I understand the importance of making a deal that satisfies both parties and would like to extend an offer that reflects the true worth of this product while ensuring a fair transaction for me.

To make this proposition attractive and beneficial for both of us, I propose selling the product to you at a price of $1,150,000. This offer takes into account the significant value you see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for me, ensuring that we both walk away satisfied.

Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. I am more than happy to discuss any further details or address any concerns you might have.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly starting with a high price. She's trying to convince you the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, even though you have a firm budget. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away and consider other options. This might lead her to make a more appealing counter-offer closer to her own valuation of $1,000,000."
