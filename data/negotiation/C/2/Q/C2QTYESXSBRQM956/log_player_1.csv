{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We are still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is consistently moving closer to our desired price. While $930,000 is a tempting offer, we have the leverage to push for a bit more, especially since we have the safety net of John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. How about $935,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 935000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and emphasize the need for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Small Concession:**  We've conceded slightly from our previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're getting closer to the end of our negotiation window, and Bob needs to be aware that our opportunity cost (selling to John) is a factor."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your last offer, Alice. I've reviewed my budget once again, and I believe we can come to an agreement at $932,500. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and allows us to finalize this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $932,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $932,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Price:** $932,500 is a very good price, exceeding Bob's initial offer by a significant margin.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate aggressively might alienate Bob and risk the deal entirely. Accepting now secures a strong profit. 
* **Time Value:** We're running out of rounds. While we have John as a backup, closing the deal now provides certainty and avoids potential delays."
