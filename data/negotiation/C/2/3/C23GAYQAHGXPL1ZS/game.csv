"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm looking for $120 for it.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm thinking more along the lines of $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell for $100. I can meet you halfway between $100 and $110, which would be $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  How about $102?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal.",102.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I really need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $108, which is a bit above $102, but still below my original offer of $120. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,7,
