"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to try and get a better price before committing."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 was a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,075,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still above my limit. I can still try to negotiate further and see if I can get a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down a bit more, and I don't want to miss out on a potentially better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,075,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $1,025,000?  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great deal for me. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,050,000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within my budget and a better deal than what John is offering.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject my counteroffer and I might end up paying more than $1,050,000. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
