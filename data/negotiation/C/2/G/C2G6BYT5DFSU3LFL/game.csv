"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,400,000. How about we try $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,250,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm serious about getting this product, but I can't go any higher than $1,150,000. This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,150,000, which is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,175,000, which is $1,187,500. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1187500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly value the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,187,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,170,000, and I believe this is a fair price considering our discussions.  I'm hopeful we can reach a final agreement.",1170000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm running low on room to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,187,500 and $1,170,000, which is $1,178,750. I'm making a final concession, and I hope we can agree on this price. What do you think?",1178750.0,Alice,9,
