"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $1,400,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget, and there's room to negotiate.  A counteroffer will give Bob a chance to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,380,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $1,380,000 is within Bob's budget and is a better price than what John is offering. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it's not guaranteed and could risk losing the deal entirely."
