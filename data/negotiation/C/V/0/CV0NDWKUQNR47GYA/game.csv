"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still above my target price.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This reflects a fair compromise and leaves room for both of us to feel comfortable with the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
