Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite comfortable with $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $9,500. How about $10,250? That's the best I can do.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000, and further haggling might not be worth the potential savings.  It's best to cut your losses and buy from John at the known price."
