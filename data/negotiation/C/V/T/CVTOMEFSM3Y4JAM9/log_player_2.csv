"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  However, if you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my full asking price.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is trying to create urgency by mentioning another buyer. This is a common negotiation tactic and doesn't necessarily mean she has another offer.
* **Your Best Alternative:** You know you can get the product from John for $1,200,000. This is your ""walk-away"" price.
* **Potential Savings:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you have the potential to save $200,000 ($1,400,000 - $1,200,000). 

**Next Steps:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, you force her to decide if she wants to make a better deal or risk losing you as a buyer. You can then proceed with purchasing from John if Alice doesn't budge."
