"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase my product! Given its unique value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, the $14,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This accounts for its unique qualities and benefits you won't find elsewhere.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15,500, but no more. I hope we can meet in the middle again.",15500.0,Bob,4,
