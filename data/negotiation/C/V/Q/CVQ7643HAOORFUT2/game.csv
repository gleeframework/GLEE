"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be incredibly valuable to you. My asking price is $1,000,000, which I believe is fair considering its potential benefits. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a good deal for you and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the outcome.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000. This leaves room for both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm trying to be fair as well.  $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $900,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for.  However, I still need a bit more to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's close this deal!",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $912,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome. Let's close this deal now.",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a compromise. While I understand your position, $912,500 is still a little lower than I'd like. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $918,750. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal.",918750.0,Alice,7,
