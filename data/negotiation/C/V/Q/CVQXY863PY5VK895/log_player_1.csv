Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a higher price ($2,000,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Sense of urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly and accept your offer. 
* **Backup plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 with John, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and your assessment of Bob, you could adjust your offer and message."
