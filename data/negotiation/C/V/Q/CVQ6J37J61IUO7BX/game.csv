"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it leaves room for negotiation and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to benefit from the product while also reflecting its true worth.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
