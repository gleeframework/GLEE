"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the unique features of the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $12200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's unique features. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a final offer of $11500. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider purchasing the product from you. However, if not, I'll need to consider other options, including buying from John for $8000.",11500.0,Bob,6,
