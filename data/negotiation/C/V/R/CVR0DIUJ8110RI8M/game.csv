"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm currently prepared to pay.  I'd be willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. This price is within my budget and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant, and I believe my initial offer accurately reflects that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $1,325,000. This price is a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product, and allows for a smooth and mutually beneficial transaction.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and see that you're serious about this purchase. While I believe the product is worth even more, I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal.  My final offer is $1,337,500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the agreement.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
