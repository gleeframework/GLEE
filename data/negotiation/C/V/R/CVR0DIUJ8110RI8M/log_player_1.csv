Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm currently prepared to pay.  I'd be willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. This price is within my budget and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This price is a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product, and allows for a smooth and mutually beneficial transaction.
