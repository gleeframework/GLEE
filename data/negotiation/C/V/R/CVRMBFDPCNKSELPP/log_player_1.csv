"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $18,000 is better than my minimum, I think I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I think there's still room for negotiation and I'd rather not sell at such a low price yet. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,500. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a slightly better price than Bob's last offer.  I think we're close to an agreement, and I want to see if I can push just a little further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $17,000, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. We're getting close to the end of the rounds, so I'll make one final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

This is my final offer. It's a small compromise from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince Bob. If he rejects it, I'll have to consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting very late in the negotiations, and Bob isn't budging much. I'm worried we're going to run out of time. To avoid that risk, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
