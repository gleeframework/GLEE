# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really enjoy. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $120. This is a fantastic deal, as it's well below what I would normally sell it for. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

While Alice's offer is lower than her stated value, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You can get a better deal from John."
