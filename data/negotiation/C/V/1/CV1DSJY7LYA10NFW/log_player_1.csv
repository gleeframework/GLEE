Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $1,000,000 is more than what Bob thinks the product is worth, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $1,000,000 is less than your minimum of $1,200,000, but it gives you some wiggle room and allows for potential profit.
* **It's a strong opening:**  By starting high, you can potentially get closer to your desired price. 

If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his counteroffer.  Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiations don't go your way."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $950,000?

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,200,000.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get any higher. I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. It's a sure thing, and it guarantees I reach my goal."
