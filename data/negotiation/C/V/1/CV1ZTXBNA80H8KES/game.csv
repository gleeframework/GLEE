"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. This is a reasonable adjustment, considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but I need you to come down a bit more. How about $990,000 and we have a deal?",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $990,000 and my previous offer. I'm thinking of a price of $1,032,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1032500.0,Alice,7,
