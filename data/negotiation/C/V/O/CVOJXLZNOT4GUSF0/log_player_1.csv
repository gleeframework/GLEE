Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of such high value."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the ""value"" and ""worth"" of the product to justify the high price. 
* **Alternative Secured:**  Knowing we have a buyer at $1,500,000 gives us leverage. We don't *need* to go below that price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. We need to be prepared for Bob to:

* **Accept:**  Ideal scenario, we maximize profit.
* **Counter-offer:**  This starts the negotiation process, and we'll need to adjust our strategy based on his offer.
* **Reject:** We'll sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
