Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still above his maximum budget.  He's already made his highest offer, and there's a good chance Alice will continue to bargain.  Since John is offering the product for Bob's maximum price, it's the best option to avoid further negotiation and ensure a deal."
