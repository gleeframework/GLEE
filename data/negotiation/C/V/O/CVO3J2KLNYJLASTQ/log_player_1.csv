Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for the best possible outcome. I'll see if Bob's interested in this price point.  If not, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I believe I can still get more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now higher than my minimum acceptable value and is getting closer to my desired price. I'll accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a deal with John, which would be less profitable."
