"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing my minimum price, leaving him to wonder about its worth.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll have to assess whether to lower my price, counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $100. I'm not willing to sell for less than that, as I can get that from John.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can leverage his interest to push for a higher price in the next round. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground. If he continues to refuse, I'll need to assess whether to lower my price further or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a bit more. How about $95?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm subtly emphasizing the product's value to justify my counteroffer, reminding Bob of the potential benefits.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm using an inviting tone, inviting Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a deal.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, I'll be happy to close the deal. If he rejects again, I'll have to decide whether to lower my price further or secure the $100 deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $92.50 is very close to my minimum price of $100. While it's not ideal, it's still a good profit margin and a better deal than selling to John.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're only halfway through the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob by pushing for a higher price. There's always a chance he might walk away entirely.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
