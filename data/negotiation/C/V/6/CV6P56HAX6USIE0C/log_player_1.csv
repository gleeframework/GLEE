Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,200,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. A rejected offer means you miss out on the potential extra profit and settle for your minimum.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Targeting Bob's Perceived Value:** The message highlights the ""unique value and potential"" to remind Bob why he's willing to pay more than your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While the offer is closer to your desired price, it leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter-offer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 
* **Confident Tone:** Using language like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal""  projects confidence in the value of the product.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,100,000. He might counter-offer,  or he might be a tough negotiator aiming for a price much lower. Be prepared to slightly adjust your offer or walk away if it goes below your minimum."
