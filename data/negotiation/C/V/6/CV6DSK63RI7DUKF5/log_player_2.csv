Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget. However, I'm still looking to make a good profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.
