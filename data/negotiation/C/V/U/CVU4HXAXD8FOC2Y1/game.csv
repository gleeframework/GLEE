"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,500.  Would that work for you?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $7,500? I think that's a fair price.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
