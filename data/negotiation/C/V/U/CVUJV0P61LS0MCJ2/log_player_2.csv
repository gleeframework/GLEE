You can do better than $9,000. You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, so there's room to negotiate. Let's try a counteroffer."

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but we're getting closer. Let's try another counteroffer.  We can aim for a price closer to the middle ground."

Alice has come down to $9,100, which is within our budget.  It's a good deal for both of us and saves us $900 compared to buying from John.  Let's accept this offer."
