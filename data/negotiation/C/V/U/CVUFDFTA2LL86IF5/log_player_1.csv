"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,700,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $850,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit potential, and it's a price I can reasonably accept. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable accepting. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not able to go below $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my opportunity cost. Let's see if we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm getting close to a deal with Bob, I've only got two rounds left, and the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob and ending up with nothing is too high. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
