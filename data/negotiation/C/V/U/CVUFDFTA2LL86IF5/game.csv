"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,700,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $850,000 for it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit potential, and it's a price I can reasonably accept. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not able to go below $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my opportunity cost. Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my range.  I'm willing to go up slightly, how about $1,025,000 and we have a deal?",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your increasing offer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can reach a mutually agreeable price at this point.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, it seems like we are getting close.  How about we split the difference and close the deal at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,8,
