Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for a competitive price of $14,000. I believe it provides significant value, even at this price point. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, hoping to persuade Bob even if the price is slightly higher than his perceived worth.

**Why not higher?**  While you could start higher, it risks alienating Bob and making him less likely to negotiate.

**Why not lower?**  Starting lower reduces your potential profit if Bob is willing to accept the $14,000 price or a price close to it."
