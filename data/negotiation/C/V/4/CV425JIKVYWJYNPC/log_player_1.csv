{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $11,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters, but it's still a good price for me considering I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $11,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my original asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a good deal for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm not going to give it away. $10,500 is still a good price for me, and I'm confident Bob will see the value in it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm still not able to justify spending $10,500 on this product. Could we meet somewhere closer to my budget, perhaps at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same amount and avoids further negotiation. I'll accept Bob's offer."
