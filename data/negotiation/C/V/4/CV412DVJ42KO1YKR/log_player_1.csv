Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $980,000. This is my best offer, as it allows me to stay within my financial limits while still acquiring the product.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his initial offer and is unlikely to move significantly higher.  While $980,000 is a decent price, accepting further concessions from him will likely result in only a marginally better deal. Selling to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000 is the best choice in this scenario to maximize profit and avoid further negotiation."
