"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $12,500?  That seems like a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $13,750? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",13750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really close to my budget here.  Let's split the difference - I'll pay $13,250.  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,250. I can see you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer on that price point.",13500.0,Alice,7,
