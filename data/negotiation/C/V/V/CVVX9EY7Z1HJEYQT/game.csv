,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $16000. I'm willing to come down to $17000, but that's as low as I can go. What are your thoughts?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I'm still committed to finding a fair price for both of us. I would like to counter with an offer of $16500 for the product.",16500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $16500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $17250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",17250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your determination, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $17000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $17500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",17500.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where I should consider other options. I'm willing to meet you at $17200, but I'm not going to go any lower. I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $17200, and if you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other buyers.
