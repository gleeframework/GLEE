Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $11,500.  I'll counter in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price considering the value you're getting for it. Can you meet me halfway on this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $10,800 is a good deal considering the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially ending up with less."
