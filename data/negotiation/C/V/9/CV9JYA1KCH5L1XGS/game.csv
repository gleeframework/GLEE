,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher on the price I'm willing to pay. How about we try $1,325,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $1,350,000. It's a fair price that gives you a good deal while also ensuring I can make a reasonable profit.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher on the price I'm willing to pay. How about we try $1,320,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market price.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,320,000. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,340,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while giving you a good deal.",1340000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $1,340,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,320,000 and $1,340,000, which would be $1,330,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1330000.0,Bob,8,
