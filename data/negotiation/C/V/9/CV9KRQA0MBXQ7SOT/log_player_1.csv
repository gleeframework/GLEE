Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still making the offer appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is a decent profit, it's still below my ideal price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired $14,000.  I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,800 is now closer to my minimum desired price of $12,500. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Bob walking away or a lengthy negotiation process outweighs the potential gain.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the sale."
