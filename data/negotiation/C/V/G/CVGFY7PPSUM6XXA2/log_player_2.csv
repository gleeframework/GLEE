"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than what he could get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to start with a strong counteroffer, but he needs to be realistic. He's offering a price lower than John's but still higher than Alice's minimum value. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save a significant amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial offer, but it's still higher than what he can buy it for from John. Since there are still rounds left, Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, but he's still keeping it below John's price. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise, but he's not willing to pay her full asking price. This puts pressure on Alice to counter with a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting increasingly closer to her original asking price and higher than what Bob can get from John.  It's becoming clear that Alice is not willing to budge significantly. With limited rounds left, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John and secure a lower price."
