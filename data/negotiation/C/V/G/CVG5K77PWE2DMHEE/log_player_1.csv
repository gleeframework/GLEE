Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to potentially sell you this product.  I think it would be a great fit for your needs. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $20,000, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation around a higher number. While Bob knows his value is lower, this might make him more willing to accept a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Preserving John:** I always have John ($15,000) as a backup plan. I don't want to offer a price so low that Bob immediately accepts, potentially leaving money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly below both my asking price and the product's value to me. While it's higher than his perceived value, it's still far from acceptable. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my minimum. Selling to John at $15,000 is a good alternative, but I want to explore if Bob is willing to go higher first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps closer to $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  I'm signaling flexibility by moving significantly from my initial offer. However, I'm not simply splitting the difference between $20,000 and $12,000. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** My counteroffer is still comfortably above both Bob's offer and John's offer.  
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""closer to $17,000"" suggests I'm willing to negotiate further, while not committing to a specific number."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $14,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, his offer of $14,000 is still below John's standing offer of $15,000. Continuing the negotiation with Bob might yield a slightly higher price, but there's no guarantee.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
