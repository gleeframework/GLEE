"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps closer to $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $14,000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
