Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps closer to $17,000?
