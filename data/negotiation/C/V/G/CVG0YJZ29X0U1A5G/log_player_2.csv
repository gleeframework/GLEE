{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

$500,000 is a very good price, but there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  We'll see how her counteroffer looks."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $300,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer, and I'm hoping to get her to come down to a more reasonable price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $400,000 is still a good price, it's worth exploring if Alice will budge further. There are still 7 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $350,000. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. It's a middle ground that could potentially lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is coming up slightly, but I'm still hoping to get a lower price.  We're getting closer to a potential agreement, and there's no need to rush into a deal at this point.  There's still time to see if we can reach a price that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $400,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a price that both Alice and I can agree on.  We've both shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer could be the sweet spot to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is only asking $475,000 now, which is very close to my last offer. This is a good deal for me, especially with only 3 rounds left. While I might be able to squeeze out a little more, the risk of losing the deal altogether is increasing. It's time to accept and secure the product at a good price."
