"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a decent starting point that allows for some room to negotiate if Bob is interested.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to go lower if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price, as it's worth at least $150 to me. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly higher than his last offer. I'm hoping he'll see the value of my product and be willing to pay closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price, as it's worth at least $150 to me. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm countering with $150, my minimum acceptable price. Bob has shown a lack of willingness to negotiate seriously, so I'm going to stick to my bottom line.  If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $150 and avoid further wasted negotiation time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not interested in paying a fair price for the product. I've already reached my minimum acceptable price, and it's clear further negotiation with Bob will be unproductive. I'm going to sell to John for $150 and avoid further wasted time."
