Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from what the product is worth to him, but still a good profit for me. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a high price:** The initial offer is ambitious, aiming for a large portion of the potential profit. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** The offer is not my absolute bottom line, allowing for some give and take during the negotiation.
* **Encourage Bob to counter:** A high initial offer might push Bob to make a counteroffer, giving us more information about his willingness to pay.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'll also keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is still a good profit, I believe I can do better.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **Bob's offer is below my initial target:**  I offered $1,400,000, and Bob's counteroffer is lower. 
* **I have room to negotiate:** I can still make a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my initial asking price.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** If negotiations with Bob stall, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000. 

I'll now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,300,000. Here's why:

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise between my initial offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000.
* **Showing flexibility:** This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a fair price.
* **Staying above John's offer:** This keeps my options open and prevents me from immediately settling for John's lower price.

I believe this counteroffer is a fair middle ground that could lead to a successful agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Reaching a compromise:** While my initial goal was higher, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 represents a significant profit for me and is close to my previous counteroffer of $1,300,000.
* **Minimizing risk:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away altogether.  Accepting his offer guarantees a good profit.
* **Time is valuable:** Prolonging the negotiation could cost me time and opportunity.

While I might have been able to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, the risk of losing the deal entirely outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
