,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understand your position. However, $1,200,000 is quite a distance from what I have in mind.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and its potential for you.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer and shows my commitment to acquiring this product.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence. Your latest offer demonstrates serious interest. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
