Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer and shows my commitment to acquiring this product.  Let's see if we can close the deal.
