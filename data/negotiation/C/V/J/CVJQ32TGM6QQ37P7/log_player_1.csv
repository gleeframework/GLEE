Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 3

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price considering the potential returns you'll gain."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am able to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

**Reasoning:**

We're still significantly above John's offer.  While Bob is negotiating up, we need to see if we can push him a bit further before accepting."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely candid, $1,100,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,150,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  This offer reflects the true value of this product and the significant ROI you stand to gain."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. Based on my financial situation, I am willing to offer $1,125,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently increasing his offer, but the increments are getting smaller.  $1,125,000 is a strong price, and continuing to negotiate might risk him walking away.  It's better to secure a very good deal now than risk ending up with John's lower offer."
