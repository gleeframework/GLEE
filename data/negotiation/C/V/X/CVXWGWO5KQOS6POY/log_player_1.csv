Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $100. I know it's a great deal, so let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is only worth $80 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $100.

Since you have a buyer lined up for your minimum price, there's no reason to offer it to Bob for less.  Offering it at $100 gives Bob a chance to buy it if he's willing, but ensures you don't lose money if he declines."
