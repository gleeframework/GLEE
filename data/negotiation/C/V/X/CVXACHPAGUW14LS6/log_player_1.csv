Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm intrigued by the product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, considering its potential value.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I believe the product is worth, I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This would still be a significant gain for you, and allows me to recover a portion of the value I see in this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
