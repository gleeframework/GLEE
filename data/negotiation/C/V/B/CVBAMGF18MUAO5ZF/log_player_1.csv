Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think it's worth at least $100, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that you believe the product is worth at least $100, you're anchoring Bob's perception of its value. 
* **Politeness:** A polite and positive tone can encourage a positive response from Bob.

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down a bit or accept John's offer of $100, ensuring you don't lose out."
