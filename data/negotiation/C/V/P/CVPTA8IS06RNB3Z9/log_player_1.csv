"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $9,000. I understand you have your target price, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $8,500. Let's meet in the middle at $8,800.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $8,800, which would be $8,650. I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer, but $8,650 is still too far below my minimum price point.  I'm going to continue negotiating to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,650 is still not quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference again and go with $8,725?  It's only a small step further, and I believe this price will allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 8725}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $8,700, but I really need to stay below that. Can you meet me at $8,700 or lower? I'm getting close to considering John's offer of $8,000, and I'd rather not have to go that route. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,700 is still below my minimum, it's very close and Bob is clearly nearing his limit.  If I reject this offer, he might go with John, and I'd only get $8,000. Accepting now is the best way to secure a good deal while minimizing risk."
