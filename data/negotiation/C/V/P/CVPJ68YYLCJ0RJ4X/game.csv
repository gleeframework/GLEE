"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $125 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $100. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you the product for $130. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
