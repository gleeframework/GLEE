"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate upwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I'll see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, hoping to meet halfway while still securing a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a decent improvement over his initial offer and getting closer to what I'm hoping for. Accepting it means a faster sale and a profit without risking the deal further."
