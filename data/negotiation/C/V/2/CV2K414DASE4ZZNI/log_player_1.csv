Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high but within reason. Bob's perceived value is $800,000, and you have a guaranteed $1,200,000 backup. Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price might tempt him while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""before I list it publicly"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is polite and suggestive, not demanding. This leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a price that's very beneficial for you."
