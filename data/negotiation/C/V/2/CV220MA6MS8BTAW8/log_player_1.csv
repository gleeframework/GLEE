I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it still leaves me with a good profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this deal and accept."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll see if I can get a better counteroffer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with a price of $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I think it's a fair price that both of us can be happy with."

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial target, it's a good deal considering the potential of further negotiation could lead to a stalemate.  I'm happy to secure a sale at $920,000."
