I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Alice.  $115 is a decent starting point, but I'm hoping to get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm starting with a slightly lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to budge."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved closer to my target price.  While I would prefer to get it even lower, accepting her offer is a good compromise.  I'm within my budget and it's better than going to John and paying the full $120."
