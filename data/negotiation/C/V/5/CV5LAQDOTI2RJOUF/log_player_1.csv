Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit and not selling below your minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This keeps the negotiation dynamic and allows for potential for a mutually beneficial outcome. 

Remember, the goal is to get as close to your desired price of $1,000,000 as possible. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially make counteroffers of your own based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that low.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price.  I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a fantastic price for a product worth so much to you.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
``` 

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:** I'm willing to compromise from my initial offer.
* **Remain above my minimum:**  $850,000 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight the value to Bob:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, encouraging him to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$825,000 is a good price. It's a bit lower than my initial goal, but it's still a significant profit and closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not sure if I can get a better deal from Bob, and I'd rather not risk losing him as a buyer altogether."
