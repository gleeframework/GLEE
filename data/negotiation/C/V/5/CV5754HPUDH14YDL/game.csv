"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $750,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $750,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget in mind.  I could go up to $900,000. That's my best offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a significant gap from where I value this product.  I could meet you halfway at $1,100,000.  This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
