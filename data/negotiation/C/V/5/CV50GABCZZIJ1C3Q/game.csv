"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $13,750 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $13,000. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $13,250, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not comfortable going any lower than that.",13250.0,Alice,5,
