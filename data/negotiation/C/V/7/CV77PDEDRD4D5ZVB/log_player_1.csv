Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below our minimum ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We know John will buy the product for $120, ensuring we don't lose money if Bob declines.

**Important:** This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know your minimum price or about John's offer."
