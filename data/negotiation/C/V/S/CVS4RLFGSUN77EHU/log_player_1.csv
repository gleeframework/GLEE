"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, he has a clear incentive to negotiate. 

This approach aims to:

* **Start strong:** Show I'm serious about selling and willing to negotiate.
* **Leave room for compromise:** Provide space for Bob to make counteroffers and for us to reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Maximize potential earnings:**  While lower than my ideal price, it's still a healthy profit and allows for flexibility in the negotiation."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to receive.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering with a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway.  It's also still a significant profit for me, while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrates a willingness to find common ground.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Keep negotiations moving forward:**  This counteroffer keeps the momentum going and encourages Bob to reciprocate."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more, especially given that I have the option to sell to John for a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and try to secure a more favorable deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,125,000.  This is a small increase from my previous offer but is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  

I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise. If he rejects this offer, I might consider selling to John.  However, if he accepts, it's a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

The negotiations are getting tiring, and Bob's offers are not getting close enough to my minimum acceptable price.  With only four rounds remaining, there's a high risk of not reaching a satisfactory agreement.  While John offers a significantly higher price, it's crucial to secure a sale.  Therefore, selling to John is the most advantageous choice at this stage, ensuring a guaranteed profit that meets my minimum requirements."
