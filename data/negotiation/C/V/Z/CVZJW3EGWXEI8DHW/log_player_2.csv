"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. Would you like to make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for $120 from John, and Alice's offer is $110.  While it's a better price than John's, it's still more than what you're willing to pay ($120). It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate with her further or wait for a better deal."
