"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further but I need to get a better price than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. It's still a great price considering the value of the product, and I hope you'll consider it. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $14,000 is close to my minimum price, and I'm confident I can't get a better offer from him. Selling to John for $15,000 would be better, but I'm also concerned I might not find another buyer in the remaining rounds.  Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer."
