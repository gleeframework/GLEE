Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I believe you'll find it incredibly valuable."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice makes a significant profit. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering a price too close to $150 might make Bob feel like he's being taken advantage of and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright.

By offering a price of $130, Alice strikes a balance between maximizing her profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
