Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""unique value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and reveals how interested he is in the product. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale with John. 
* Depending on Alice's risk tolerance and how much she wants to secure a deal with Bob, she could start with a lower price."
