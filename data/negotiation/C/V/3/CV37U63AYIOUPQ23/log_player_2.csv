"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  I know the product is worth more to me, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.  Let's meet halfway - how about $10,750?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,750 is within Bob's budget, and significantly lower than buying from John. Accepting this offer achieves Bob's goal of saving money.  While further negotiation could potentially get an even lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and forcing Bob to pay John's higher price is not worth the potential for a slightly lower price."
