Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, my budget caps out at $700,000 for this product.  If you're willing to work within that range, I think we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price, Bob has clearly indicated his budget ceiling. It's unlikely he'll go beyond $700,000. Accepting this offer means a $100,000 loss compared to John's standing offer.  It's strategically sound to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John rather than risking a lower final offer from Bob."
