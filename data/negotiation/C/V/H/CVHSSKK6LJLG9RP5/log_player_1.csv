"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob (""great deal,"" ""valuable"") to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with an invitation for Bob to respond, keeping the communication open. 

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged. Starting high allows me to potentially secure a better price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate to reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $9,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than $9,000. 
* **Avoiding Selling to John:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for the best possible outcome, which means trying to maximize my profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $10,500 is the best I can do right now.  This still represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's keep the conversation going!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm countering with $10,500,  which is  a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price for me.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing the benefit of the deal for him.
* **Open Communication:** I encourage further discussion and maintain a positive tone to keep Bob engaged. 

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us.  By making a slightly lower counteroffer, I'm signaling that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and I'm willing to consider $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We are already in round 4, and I'm aware of the 10-round limit. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, I believe further negotiation might be difficult and time-consuming, especially with the risk of Bob backing out entirely. 

**Reasoning:**

Accepting Bob's offer at this point offers a good balance between securing a sale and maximizing my profit.  It's a significant improvement from his initial offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being overly stubborn."
