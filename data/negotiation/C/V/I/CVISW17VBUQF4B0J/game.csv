"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider it?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider it?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 just isn't enough for me to consider. To be honest,  I'm surprised you're not willing to go higher. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer before I consider other buyers. Let me know if you're serious about this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $9,750. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider it?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm not interested in wasting more time with small increments.  To make this quick, I'm willing to come down to $9,900, but that's my absolute final offer. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. If you're not ready to close the deal at this price, I'm going to move on to another buyer.",9900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $9,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider buying from another seller",9800.0,Bob,8,
