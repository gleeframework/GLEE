"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. That price is quite high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but that's still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I can't accept $950,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
