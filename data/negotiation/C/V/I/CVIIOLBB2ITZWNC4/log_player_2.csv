**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but her ""final offer"" is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and there's no guarantee you can negotiate her down further.  Buying from John ensures you get the product at the best possible price for you."
