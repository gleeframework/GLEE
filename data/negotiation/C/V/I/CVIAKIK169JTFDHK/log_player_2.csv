# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll be moving on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
