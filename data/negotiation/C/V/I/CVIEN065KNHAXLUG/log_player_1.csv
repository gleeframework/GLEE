Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price of $11,500 or higher. There's still room for negotiation, and I have 8 more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $11,000?  That's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,750? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my target price, $10,750 is still below my minimum desired price of $10,000. I have 6 more rounds left, and I believe I can still reach a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to split the difference again.  How about $10,875?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,875. How about $10,800? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,800 is just above my minimum desired price of $10,000. While I would prefer a higher price, we are running out of time, and there's a risk of Bob becoming unwilling to negotiate further. It's also a better price than selling to John for $10,000.  Accepting this offer secures a decent profit for me."
