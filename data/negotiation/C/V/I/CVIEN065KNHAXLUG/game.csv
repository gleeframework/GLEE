"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $11,000?  That's a good compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to split the difference again.  How about $10,875?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",10875.0,Alice,5,
