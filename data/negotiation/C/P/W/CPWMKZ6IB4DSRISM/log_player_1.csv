Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, the goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price could still yield a significant gain.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Setting the price at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000.  
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly."
