"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $10,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit.  While I see the value in the product, I can't go higher than $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $11,000? It's the highest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
