Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have a strong position.  Starting high allows you to potentially maximize your profit if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A high initial offer gives you room to negotiate down if Bob pushes back, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle that's still very profitable for you.
* **Psychological Anchoring:**  By starting with a higher number, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value, potentially making him more receptive to a slightly lower price than if you started low. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Research:** This strategy assumes you have some knowledge of the market and that $19,000 isn't drastically out of line with what similar products might sell for.
* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is highly price-sensitive or dislikes negotiation, you might adjust your starting price slightly lower."
