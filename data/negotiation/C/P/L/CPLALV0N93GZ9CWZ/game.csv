"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit higher than you're comfortable with, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it will bring to your business.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
