"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $95? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to go elsewhere, but I have to make a smart financial decision.",95.0,Bob,4,
