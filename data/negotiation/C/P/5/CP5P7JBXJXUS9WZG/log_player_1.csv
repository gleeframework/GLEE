Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This is a reasonable starting point. It's a price that's higher than what Bob values the product at, but lower than what you would get from John. This leaves room for negotiation, but also signals your intention to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway. $13,500 is a fair compromise and still leaves some room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still below what I'd get from John. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 than risk further negotiation with Bob."
