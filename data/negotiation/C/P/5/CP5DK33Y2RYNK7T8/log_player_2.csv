"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $140. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $140, which is more than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($100). Therefore, I reject her offer and proceed to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate the special price, but unfortunately, I can't go higher than $100 at this time. Is that a price you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is $130, which is still more than my maximum of $100.  Since I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100, it makes more sense to take that deal and avoid further negotiation."
