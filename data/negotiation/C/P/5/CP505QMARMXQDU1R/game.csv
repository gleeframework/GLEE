"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about $120? I'm sure we can find a middle ground.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $130.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $130. I can do $135, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $132, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",132.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $132. How about we meet in the middle at $136?",136.0,Alice,7,
