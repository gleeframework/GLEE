"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if I can get a lower price closer to Alice's perceived value of $8,000."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is coming down, but we're still above my target price. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to $9,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?"",
