Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust accordingly.  Remember, I can always fall back on John's $800,000 offer if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my ideal price.  Hopefully, he'll see the value in my product and agree to this price."

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and still gets me close to my ideal price.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
