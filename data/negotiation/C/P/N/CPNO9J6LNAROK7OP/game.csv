"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and I need to make a profit. I can do $160, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $135? That feels like a fair deal to me.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we aim for $155? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I have other options, and $155 is just a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $145.  That's my final offer.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $145, but I can meet you at $152. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",152.0,Alice,7,
