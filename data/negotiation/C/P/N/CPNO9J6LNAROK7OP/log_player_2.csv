Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $145, but I can meet you at $152. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $150. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation for a potential savings of only $2. Buying from John guarantees the best price with no further hassle."
