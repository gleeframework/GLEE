"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take advantage of it!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not comfortable going down to $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference - how about $97.50? I'm sure we can both agree that's a fair price.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $97.50 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $102? It's a fair price for the product, and I think it's worth it for both of us.",102.0,Alice,5,
