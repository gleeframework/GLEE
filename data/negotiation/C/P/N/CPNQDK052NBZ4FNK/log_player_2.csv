"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take advantage of it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

You can do better than $100, so reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not comfortable going down to $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
You can still get a better price than $105. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference - how about $97.50? I'm sure we can both agree that's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $97.50 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $102? It's a fair price for the product, and I think it's worth it for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is only willing to go down to $102.  You can get the product from John for $120, which is still within your budget, and saves you from further negotiation with Alice."
