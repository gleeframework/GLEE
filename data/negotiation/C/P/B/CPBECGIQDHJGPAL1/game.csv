"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000.  If you're not willing to come down, I'm going to have to explore other options. ",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm not willing to go down to $9,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $9,750 is my final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, let's close the deal now.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is my final offer. If you don't accept, I'll be forced to look elsewhere.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, and I'm willing to make one last concession.  $9,600 is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's end this negotiation on a positive note.",9600.0,Alice,7,
