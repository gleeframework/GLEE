Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000. By pricing it at $1,400,000, Alice maximizes her potential profit while still leaving Bob with a significant incentive to buy ($100,000 gain). 
* **John as a Back-up:**  Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't get less than $1,200,000. This allows her to negotiate from a position of strength with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value creates a sense of urgency and potential ""loss aversion"" if he rejects the deal."
