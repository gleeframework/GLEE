"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $80 to Bob. Alice's offer of $150 is far too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
``` 

Bob's initial counteroffer of $60 is a significant reduction from Alice's asking price of $150. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal. This counteroffer is also below his maximum price of $80, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $120 is still too high for Bob. He is willing to pay no more than $80.  He should reject the offer and continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
``` 
Bob's counteroffer of $70 is getting closer to his maximum price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $110 is still too high for Bob. He is willing to pay no more than $80.  He should reject the offer and continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer of $75 is a slight increase from his previous offer of $70, demonstrating that he is willing to compromise. This offer is still within his maximum price of $80, leaving some room for negotiation. This is a strategic move to show Alice that he is serious about closing the deal but also wants a fair price."
