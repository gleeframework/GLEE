# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to a fair agreement. I propose selling the product to you for $140. This price reflects both the product's worth and ensures a reasonable profit for me. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.
