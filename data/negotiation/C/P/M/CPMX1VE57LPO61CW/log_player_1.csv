Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is a good starting point since it's closer to my minimum value than Bob's. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I use language that suggests I'm open to negotiation, which could encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 

This approach allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and my own willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target higher:** While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price.  
* **Negotiation opportunity:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and continue negotiating.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I have John's offer as a fallback, so I'm not pressured to accept a price that's too low. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a price closer to $14,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but still higher than his.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I emphasize the fairness of the price by mentioning the product's value to Bob. 
* **Urgency:** I use language that suggests I'm willing to finalize the deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground, potentially leading to a successful transaction without having to rely on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **High risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate risks further lowering the price, potentially leading to a deal that's not beneficial for me. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit of $15,000, making it the most reliable and profitable choice.

Given these factors, selling to John is the best option in this scenario. It eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation and ensures a good outcome for me."
