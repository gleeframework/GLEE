Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
