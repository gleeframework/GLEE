"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting a product worth $1,200,000 to you at a significant discount. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
