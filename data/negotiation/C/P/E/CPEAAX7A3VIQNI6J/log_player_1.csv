"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $16,000 is still too far from what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'll counteroffer Bob again."
