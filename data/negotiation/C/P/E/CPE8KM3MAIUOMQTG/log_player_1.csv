Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit for a quick sale."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message aims to gauge Bob's interest. By mentioning willingness to negotiate, you encourage him to engage even if the initial price seems high.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering the product at $19,000 positions it as potentially more valuable than Bob's perceived worth of $10,000.  It also creates a significant gap between your minimum price and the offer, allowing for negotiation towards a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might lower the initial offer slightly.
* **Market Demand:**  If the product is in high demand and you think Bob might be aware of that, you could potentially hold firmer on the initial price."
