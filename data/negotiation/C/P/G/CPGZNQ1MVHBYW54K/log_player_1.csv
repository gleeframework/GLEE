"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $14,000 is well above your $12,000 minimum, ensuring you profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario for both of you. 
* **It sets a strong initial bargaining position:** By starting high, you demonstrate the value you see in the product and create space for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is a decent offer and above my minimum, I can likely get a better price. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and try to secure a higher price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while staying above Bob's offer. 
* **Closing the gap:**  By moving closer to Bob's price, I signal my willingness to negotiate and potentially reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining profit margin:**  $13,500 is still above my minimum price of $12,000, ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $12,500 is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** We've been through several rounds, and the gap between our prices is narrowing.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or me having to sell to John at my minimum price.

Accepting this offer ensures a quick and relatively profitable sale, considering the potential risks of further negotiation."
