# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000, Bob can still do better. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can negotiate with Alice or explore other options to potentially get a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to secure the deal, or Bob might find another seller with a better offer."
