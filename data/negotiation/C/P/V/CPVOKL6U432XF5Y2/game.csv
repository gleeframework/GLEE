"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $18,000 would be more reflective of that. What do you say?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that the product offers significant value, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $14,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're getting closer!  I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle on $16,000? That's a very competitive price for the value you're getting.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,500, which is the lowest I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",14500.0,Bob,6,
