"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I'm aiming to pay less than $150, and I have plenty of rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation. It's a starting point, and I'm prepared to adjust my offer upward in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $110 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down a bit, but $160 is still too high compared to my $150 alternative with John. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a strict budget.  Could you meet me halfway at $135?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer to show I'm willing to move closer to her price, but $135 is still a significant savings over her current offer and John's price.  By suggesting ""halfway,"" I'm hoping to make it seem like a fair compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $145. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $145, which is a reasonable compromise and saves me $5 compared to John's offer. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and I risk reaching an impasse. Accepting now secures a decent deal."
