"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time.  This is my maximum price, considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I believe it's a great compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'll sell the product to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I'm determined to make this happen, but $15500 is still a bit too much. I'm willing to go up to $14500, but that's truly my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",14500.0,Bob,8,
