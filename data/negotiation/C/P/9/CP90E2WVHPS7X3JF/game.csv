"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $900,000, but I'm afraid it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming back to me. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $975,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm counteroffering $1,075,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value to you while also being reasonable for me.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is slightly above your latest offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
