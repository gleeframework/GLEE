Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, my maximum limit.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. I'm confident the product is worth more than that to you, but I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $1,000,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum limit. There's room for further negotiation. It's worthwhile to continue the negotiation process to see if you can get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still stuck at my maximum budget of $800,000.

Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $1000000, which is $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my maximum budget of $800,000.
