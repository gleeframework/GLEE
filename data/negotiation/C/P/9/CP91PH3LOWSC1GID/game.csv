"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, my maximum limit. I'm confident this is a fair price given the value I'm placing on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. I'm confident the product is worth more than that to you, but I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still stuck at my maximum budget of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product. If you're not comfortable with that, I might have to look at other options. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $1000000, which is $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my maximum budget of $800000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in selling it to me at this price. It's a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,6,
