**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at a price point significantly lower than our minimum. He's barely budging in his offers, indicating a reluctance to meet our valuation.  While we could continue negotiating, the risk of him lowballing further or reaching an impasse is high. Selling to John guarantees our minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation risks."
