"I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,500,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,800,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.

"I appreciate the reduction, but $1,650,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. My final offer is $1,450,000. I believe this is a very fair price, and I need a decision from you this round.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",1450000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your urgency, but I'm not willing to pay $1,450,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
