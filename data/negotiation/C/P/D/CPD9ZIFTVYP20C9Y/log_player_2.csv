"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum price. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $1,200,000. This counteroffer leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, signaling Bob's serious intent to purchase but at a price that works for him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's maximum, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation with Alice.  There are still 7 rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price, and rejecting this offer keeps Bob's bargaining power strong."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but still maintaining a distance from Alice's price.  This counteroffer signals a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. The smaller increment also encourages Alice to consider accepting, as it's getting closer to her desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is significantly closer to Bob's maximum of $1,200,000, and it's only $20,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer maximizes Bob's savings and secures the product.  There's a risk that Alice might reject any further counteroffers, and continuing negotiation might lead to a higher price or a lost deal entirely. Accepting this offer ensures a reasonable price and guarantees the purchase."
