"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $100 to you! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than the product's value to you ($100). There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a great value for you, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's still a bit more than the product is worth to you, but it's a significant decrease from her initial offer and a better deal than buying from John.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and ensure you get the product."
