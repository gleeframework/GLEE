"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $13,000. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your asking price and still within my budget.  Let's make a deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, so I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer the product to you for $15,200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think.",15200.0,Alice,5,
