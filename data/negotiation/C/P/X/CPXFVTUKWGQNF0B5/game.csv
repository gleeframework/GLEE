"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a great deal for a product you value at $120, and it gives us both something to work with. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $115, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal now. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,
