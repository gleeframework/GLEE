Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation. It's also important to be friendly and open to negotiation to encourage a positive interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a great deal for a product you value at $120, and it gives us both something to work with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $115, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to $120 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal now. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
