{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:**  It's above Bob's $800,000 valuation, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Lower than Alice's minimum:** It's significantly lower than Alice's minimum of $1,000,000, making it a potentially attractive deal for Bob.
* **Leaves room for counteroffers:** It allows for the potential of a counteroffer and further negotiation without Alice having to drastically lower her price.

This approach aims to balance maximizing profit with the potential for a successful negotiation and sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to make a more significant discount. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than Alice's minimum goal of $1,000,000.  Alice has a better offer from John, so rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a good value for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $875,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $875,000 is closer to Alice's desired price, it's still below her minimum goal of $1,000,000. Since John is offering her $1,000,000, it makes more sense to sell the product to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
