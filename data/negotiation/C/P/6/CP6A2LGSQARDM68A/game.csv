"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
