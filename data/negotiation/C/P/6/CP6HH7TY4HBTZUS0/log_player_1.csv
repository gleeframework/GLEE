Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000.  I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give me valuable information. If he accepts immediately, I know I could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, I can adjust my offer downwards.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have the security of knowing John will buy the product for $8,000. This allows me to be more assertive in my negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response and willingness to engage."
