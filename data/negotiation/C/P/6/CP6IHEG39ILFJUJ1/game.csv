"Alice, your initial price is unfortunately much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I understand this product is valuable, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 for it at this time. I'm serious about buying, so let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is my best price for now, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000. I'm confident this product is worth it to me at that price, and I'm hoping we can close a deal soon.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I really want to make this deal work, but $1300000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is my final offer - if you're not able to meet me there, I may have to consider other options.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm willing to make one last push to close the deal. I'm going to meet you at $1300000, but I need you to meet me halfway from there. I'll sell it to you for $1275000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
