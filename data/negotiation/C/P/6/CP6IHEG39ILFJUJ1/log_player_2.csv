{""message"": ""Alice, your initial price is unfortunately much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I understand this product is valuable, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000 for it at this time.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is my best price for now, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Alice is still above my budget.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to considering John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. I'm confident this product is worth it to me at that price, and I'm hoping we can close a deal soon."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm getting nervous about running out of time.  I'm starting to think John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I really want to make this deal work, but $1,300,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer - if you're not able to meet me there, I may have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm willing to make one last push to close the deal. I'm going to meet you at $1300000, but I need you to meet me halfway from there. I'll sell it to you for $1275000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm also running out of time.  The risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and losing more rounds is too high. John's offer is guaranteed, and even though I'm paying more, I'm  confident I can make that money back with the product."
