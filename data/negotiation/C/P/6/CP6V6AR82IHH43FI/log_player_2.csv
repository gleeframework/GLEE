"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let's make this happen!

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle around $600,000?  That seems fair given the market value."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant discount for you given the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $725,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still looking for something closer to $800,000. Let's meet halfway and settle on $762,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.
