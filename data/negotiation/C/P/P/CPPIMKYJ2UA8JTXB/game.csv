"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your product is of interest to me,  $600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $500,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $550,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll receive from the product.",550000.0,Alice,3,
