We've reached a point where further haggling is unlikely to yield significant savings. Alice is clearly anchored around the $80 mark, and while we might squeeze out another dollar or two, it's not worth the risk of her walking away.  Accepting the $82.50 offer secures a decent discount from both Alice's original price and John's backup option."
