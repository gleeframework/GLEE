"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $77.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",82.5,Alice,5,
