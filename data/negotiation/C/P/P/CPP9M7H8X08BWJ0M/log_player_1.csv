Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm looking to get $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  This also gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is worth less than $100 to me. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my asking price. How about $95?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. This gives him a slight discount while still keeping my earnings above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose a price of $90. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer.  It's a good price and I'm not sure I can get him to budge further. It's better to accept the offer and avoid the risk of him walking away and me having to sell to John for less."
