"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, considering its worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm going to try to counter with a price closer to my original offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about $100? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product to you. "", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $100.  This is still a good deal for me, and hopefully, Bob will be willing to pay this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $90.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $90 is a good price, and I'm happy with the outcome.  I don't want to risk losing Bob completely by continuing to counteroffer, and I'm confident that $90 is better than selling to John."
