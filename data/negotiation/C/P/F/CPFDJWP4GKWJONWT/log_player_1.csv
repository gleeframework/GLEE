Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know if that works for you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
