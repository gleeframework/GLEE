"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I see you're serious about this product.  While I recognize your proposed price,  I'm targeting a figure closer to $2,000,000. To find middle ground, I'll come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true value and potential this product holds.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  Perhaps we can meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This would allow for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
