"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant compromise, and it's a price that I believe is fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. This shows I'm serious about buying it from you, and I believe we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $900,000. However, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal!",925000.0,Alice,5,
