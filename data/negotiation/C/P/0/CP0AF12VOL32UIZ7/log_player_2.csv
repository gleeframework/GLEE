You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget. You should counteroffer again and see if you can reach a price that works for both of you."

Alice is still too high for your budget.  You've already counteroffered twice and are close to your limit.  While you're saving money over her initial offer, it's time to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
