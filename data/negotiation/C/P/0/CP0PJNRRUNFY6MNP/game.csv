"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit out of my price range.  How about $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $110.  If you're willing to come down to that, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can sell the product to you for $115. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
