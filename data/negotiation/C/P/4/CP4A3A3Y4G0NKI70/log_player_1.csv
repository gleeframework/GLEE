Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for more, Bob is consistently moving towards my price point and we are getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting at $1,030,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
