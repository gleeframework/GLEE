"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  This still allows you to pay less than my initial price and leaves room for you to feel like you got a good deal.  What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $12,000. Can you consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
