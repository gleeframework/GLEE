Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, meaning you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $14,000 is less than the $15,000 the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you can create space for negotiation while still maximizing your potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is above my minimum, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves less room for future negotiation. I believe I can likely get closer to my desired price by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  This still allows you to pay less than my initial price and leaves room for you to feel like you got a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $12,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly the same price that John is willing to pay.  While I would prefer to get more, accepting this offer allows me to avoid further negotiation and secures the sale.  This is the best outcome in this scenario, as it meets my minimum price."
