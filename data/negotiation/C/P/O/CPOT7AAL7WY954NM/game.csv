"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? This would give you a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $87.50 is still a bit below what I need. How about we meet in the middle again at $90? This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $88. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to make a deal. Can you meet me at this price?",88.0,Bob,6,
