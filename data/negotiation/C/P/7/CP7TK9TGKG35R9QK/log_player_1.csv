Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly avoids the delay of going to John, even if John offers a guaranteed $8,000.

By starting at $9,500, Alice aims to secure a significant portion of the potential profit while still giving Bob a reason to accept the deal."
