"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying from Alice at $180 when you can get it from John for $150.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a lower offer of $130.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. Let's see if she's willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still asking for more than John's price. It's worth seeing if we can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $140. This is still less than Alice's offer, but closer to John's price. Hopefully, this will convince Alice to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $155 is tempting, John offers the same product for $150.  We've had a few rounds of negotiation, and it's clear Alice isn't willing to come down to my desired price.  It's better to take the sure thing with John."
