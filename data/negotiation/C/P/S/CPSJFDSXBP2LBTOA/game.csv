"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to work with me. I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $8500? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'm getting.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8750. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",8750.0,Alice,3,
