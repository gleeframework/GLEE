"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, it's still not ideal.  You can try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer, which could lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is slightly above Alice's minimum value. This leaves room for negotiation while still being within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now $500 less than my maximum budget and only $500 above Alice's minimum value. This is a good compromise and a fair price for both parties.  There's not much more room to negotiate, so accepting this offer is the best choice."
