{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value to you, I'm sure we can reach a mutually beneficial price. My starting offer is $1,200,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my valuation of the product, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial rejection, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  Considering your high valuation of this product, I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This allows for a healthy profit for both of us and keeps the deal moving forward. Let's continue this productive discussion."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've given this some thought and am willing to consider $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable and moves us closer to closing the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I want to see if I can push Bob further to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 remains below my minimum.  Considering your initial valuation, I believe we can still find a mutually beneficial price.  My counteroffer is $1,080,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1080000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to find common ground. I'm willing to move to $1,070,000 for the product. I believe this offers a good balance between our positions. Let me know if this is within your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,070,000 is still slightly below my minimum acceptable value, it's very close, and the negotiations are becoming increasingly difficult.  There's a good chance I might not be able to get a better offer in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk selling to John for a significantly lower price.  This offer is a good compromise and secures a decent profit for me."
