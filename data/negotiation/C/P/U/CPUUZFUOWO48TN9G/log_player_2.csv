"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a good starting point, but there's potential to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A lower price like $300,000 is aggressive, but it's a good starting point to see how much she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice is clearly willing to bargain, so continuing to negotiate could lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $350,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, demonstrating my willingness to meet halfway.  It's also still below my maximum price of $1,000,000, giving me room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still not close to my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I have several rounds left and can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $400,000, aiming for a middle ground.  This shows continued progress in negotiations, while still leaving room for potential further price reduction. The remaining rounds allow for more flexibility, but I'm trying to secure a deal before reaching the price from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the same as her initial offer, but it's important to remember that we're nearing the end of the negotiations.  Given the remaining rounds and the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price, accepting the offer seems like the best option. It allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price while mitigating potential risks.  While further negotiation is possible, the value of the product for me is clearly worth $500,000."
