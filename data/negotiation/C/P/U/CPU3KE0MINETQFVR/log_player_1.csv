Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above our minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, while still securing a profit above our guaranteed sale price to John. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creates a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects it, we still have the safety net of selling to John for $120."
