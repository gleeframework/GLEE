"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to Bob, so he wants to pay less than that.
* Alice's offer of $95 is too high. 
* Bob has 10 rounds, so there's room for negotiation.  He should reject and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* He knows the product is worth $80 to Alice, so offering $85 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* There are still 9 rounds left, giving Alice room to counter if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $100 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. 
* He has 8 rounds remaining, so he can continue negotiating to get a lower price. 
*  Buying from John for $120 is not a good option at this point because Bob can likely get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible, but also needs to be realistic. 
* Alice rejected his previous offer of $85, so he's increasing his offer slightly to $90.
* This shows he's willing to compromise while still trying to get a good price. 
* There are 7 rounds remaining, so there's still room for negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $105 is still too high for Bob.

* Buying from John for $120 is still not a good option, as Bob is likely to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 92}
```

* Bob is willing to increase his offer slightly to $92, showing his willingness to compromise.
* There are 5 rounds remaining, which gives both parties some room to continue negotiating. 
* Bob believes he can get a better price than John's $120, so he wants to continue with Alice."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $110 is still too high for Bob. 
* He has 4 rounds remaining, which is still a significant amount of time to continue negotiating. 
* Buying from John for $120 is still not a good option because Bob is likely to get a better price from Alice. 
* It's worth trying to push Alice down a bit more before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice rejected Bob's offer of $92, but it was getting close.
* Bob is increasing his offer to $95, which is closer to Alice's last offer of $110.
* This shows that Bob is willing to compromise and is getting closer to Alice's price point.
* There are only 3 rounds remaining, so Bob needs to be more aggressive in his negotiation. 
* This is a reasonable compromise to get a deal done, and still save money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $115 is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still higher than he wants to pay.
* There is only 1 round left, and there is no guarantee Alice will accept Bob's next counteroffer.
* It's risky to continue negotiating because there's no time left to make up for a bad deal.
* Buying from John for $120 is a safe option, as it guarantees Bob gets the product for a price he's willing to pay. 
* It's better to get the product now and avoid the risk of failing to reach a deal with Alice."
