"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value and uniqueness of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price within the range of $1200000. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our positions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1350000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the gesture, I still feel that the product's price should align more closely with my budget.

"Thank you for your final counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1325000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline at this time. Given my budget constraints, I am unable to accept an offer higher than $1300000. I believe this price is fair and reflective of the product's value. I hope we can find a way to agree upon this amount, or I'll have to move forward with purchasing the product from John for $1200000.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
