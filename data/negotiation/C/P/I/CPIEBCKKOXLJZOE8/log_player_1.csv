Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to haggle, but still secures a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  While aiming high, we need to stay below $150 to ensure Bob finds the deal acceptable. Offering a price too close to $150 increases the risk of him rejecting it and forcing you to sell to John for $120."
