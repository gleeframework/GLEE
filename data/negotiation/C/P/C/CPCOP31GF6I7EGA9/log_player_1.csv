"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product at a competitive price of $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to get a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can still secure a better deal. Selling to John is a good backup option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that still allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better. How about we try $10,750? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired price, I still have a few rounds left to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  Selling to John is always a safe option, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. While $10,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still a bit away from my target.  Let's try $10,900. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,750. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I think we're getting close to the limit. How about we meet at $10,800? That's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is still below my ideal price,  I have only 4 rounds left.  Bob is clearly not going to budge much more. It's time to take the deal.  The risk of continuing is that Bob might get even more stubborn, and I might end up with a worse deal. It's best to accept the current offer and lock in the profit."
