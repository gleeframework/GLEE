"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's maximum budget is $10,000. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John ($11,500 vs $10,000), it still exceeds Bob's budget. Therefore, the best option is to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for his lower price."
