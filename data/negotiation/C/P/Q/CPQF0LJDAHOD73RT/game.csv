"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $1,450,000 unfortunately falls below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,550,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still ensures a fair return for me. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial outcome.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
