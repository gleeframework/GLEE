"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. It's important to set a high initial price to maximize potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $500,000 is far below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is still a decent profit for me, but it's closer to my minimum value and shows I'm serious about negotiating with Bob. Hopefully, this will be more enticing than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still way too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $1,600,000. While I'm still holding firm on my minimum value, I need to show some flexibility.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell for less than what the product is worth to me. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,500,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm not willing to go lower. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's not coming close to my minimum value, and I'm running out of time. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a solid deal and guarantees I won't lose money."
