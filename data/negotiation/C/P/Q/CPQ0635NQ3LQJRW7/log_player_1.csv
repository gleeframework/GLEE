"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for something worth so much to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob and make him more inclined to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer more appealing. 

**Important Note:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price point. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions. I will also keep the option of selling to John for $15,000 in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? This still represents a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $10,000 is still a good price for him, considering the value he places on the product.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $10,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I'm not risking a significant loss. 
* **Building Towards a Deal:**  I'm aiming for a quick resolution and am hoping this counteroffer will lead to an agreement."
