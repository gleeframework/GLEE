Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

Since I know I can get $12,000 from John, I'm offering the product to Bob at the same price. This gives him the option to buy at a price that's higher than its value to him, but lower than the price I can get from another buyer. This maximizes my potential earnings while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product."
