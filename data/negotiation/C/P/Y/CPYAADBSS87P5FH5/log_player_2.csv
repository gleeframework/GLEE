"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you, Bob! I'm willing to let you have this fantastic product for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120, so you're willing to spend up to that amount.
* Alice's offer is $110, which is a good deal, but you can get it for $120 from John.
* To save the most money, you should reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $120."
