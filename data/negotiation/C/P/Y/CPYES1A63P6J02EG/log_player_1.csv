Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you.  Let me know your decision soon!"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so aiming for a price closer to that amount maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John at $800,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

By setting the price at $925,000, Alice creates a win-win situation where she significantly increases her profit margin, while still offering Bob a price lower than his perceived value."
