"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?  I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $900,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  Let's find some middle ground.  How about $1,050,000?  This is still a great price for you, given the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, $975,000 is still too low for me. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. I'm confident you'll find it a good investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
