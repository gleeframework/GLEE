"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?  I think that's a fair price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $900,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  Let's find some middle ground.  How about $1,050,000?  This is still a great price for you, given the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. I'm confident you'll find it a good investment. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
