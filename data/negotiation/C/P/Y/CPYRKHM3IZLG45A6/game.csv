"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-value item that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $18,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $13,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $14,500. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,6,

"I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1,000. This way, you'll get the product and some additional value for $14,500. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extra service you're offering, but I'm still not willing to pay $14,500. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product and the service. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you a great deal with the extra service, and you're still trying to get it for $13,500. I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. I'll do one more compromise: I'll throw in an additional service worth $500, making it a total of $1,500 in extras. I'll sell the product to you for $14,000, and the total value you'll get is $14,500. This is my final offer. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extra services you're offering, but I'm still not willing to pay $14,000. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product and the services. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $8,000.",13000.0,Bob,10,
