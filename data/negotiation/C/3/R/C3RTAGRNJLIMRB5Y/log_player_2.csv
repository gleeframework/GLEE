{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Even though you value the product at $12,000, Alice's price of $9,500 is significantly cheaper. 
* **You're still getting a good deal.**  Alice values the product at $8,000, and you're paying $1,500 more. This means you're getting a good deal while still saving money."
