It's time to cut bait. Bob is clearly trying to wear me down and get the lowest possible price.  While I could try to squeeze a few more dollars out of him, it's not worth the risk of him lowballing me further or stalling until I'm desperate.  John's offer is a guaranteed $100, which is my minimum."
