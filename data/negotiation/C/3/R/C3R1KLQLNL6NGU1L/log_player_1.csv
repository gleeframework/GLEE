Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,999. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to aim for the highest price Bob might reasonably accept. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price ($11,999) leaves a small margin for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still securing you a significant profit. 
* **Urgency and Value:** The message hints at a good deal without explicitly stating your minimum, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
 
By starting high, you give yourself the best chance to maximize your earnings from the sale."
