Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a great deal! How about $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Since we know Bob values the product at $100, starting with a price higher than that gives us room to negotiate or potentially get a better deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Offering $120 allows for the possibility of Bob countering with a lower offer (e.g., $110), which would still be profitable for you.
* **Alternative buyer safety net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price ($100)."
