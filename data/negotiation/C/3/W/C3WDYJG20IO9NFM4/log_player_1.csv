"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $10,000, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 offer:**  This is a starting point that's lower than my minimum value ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm starting with a friendly tone, highlighting the product's benefits to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will indicate if he's willing to negotiate.
* **Leave room for potential counteroffers:**  If he rejects the initial offer, I can adjust my price in subsequent rounds.
* **Maintain the possibility of selling to John:**  I'm keeping the option open to sell to John for my minimum value if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $10,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I have 10 rounds to reach a deal, so rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round. 
* **Maintaining the option to sell to John:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, selling to John for $12,000 remains a viable option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer:** I'm raising the price to $9,500, which is still lower than my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Focus on a compromise:** My message emphasizes finding a middle ground that benefits both of us. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  I remind Bob that even at $9,500, he's getting a good deal.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain my profit margin:**  $9,500 is closer to my minimum value and still a good deal for Bob.
* **Signal flexibility:**  Showing willingness to negotiate can increase the chances of reaching a deal.
* **Keep the option to sell to John open:**  I haven't yet committed to selling to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000 is a reasonable compromise:** While it's still below my minimum of $12,000, it's a good compromise and offers a decent profit. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** I have several more rounds to continue negotiating, so even if I accept now, there's still an opportunity to potentially get a higher price in the future.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale, whereas rejecting it and risking another counteroffer from Bob could lead to a lower price or even a failed deal.

**Overall, accepting Bob's offer balances profit with the risk of further negotiation, and I can still potentially get a better deal in subsequent rounds.**"
