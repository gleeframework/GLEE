"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $10,000, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $10,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
