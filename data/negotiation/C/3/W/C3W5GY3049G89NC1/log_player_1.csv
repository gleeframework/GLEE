Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000. This is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys from you and resells or utilizes it.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,000 (your minimum) and $1,200,000 (Bob's maximum). Any price within this range can be mutually beneficial.

**The Offer**

You want to aim high while still giving Bob a reason to accept. Here's a possible offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Why this offer makes sense:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It secures you a significant profit above your minimum while leaving Bob with a potential $50,000 gain. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) creates a sense of urgency, potentially nudging Bob to decide quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Instead of just focusing on price, highlight the product's ""unique value proposition."" Remind Bob why he's interested in the first place.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Bob might negotiate. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward, but always keep your $1,000,000 minimum in mind."
