"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm sure you'll find very interesting. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. Would you like to accept or make a counteroffer?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $2000000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I can meet you in the middle at $1200000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $900000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I can offer it to you for $1100000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me here.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can meet you at $1100000, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $950000, Bob, but I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is my last offer, so I hope you can meet me here.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I've reached my maximum budget, Alice. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I don't get a better price. I'll make one final offer of $925000. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800000.",925000.0,Bob,8,
