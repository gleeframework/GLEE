"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my need to make a profit. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
