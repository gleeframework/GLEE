Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1000000. What do you think?,900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to own this unique product, but I'm not quite ready to pay $900000. I'm willing to offer $700000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $850000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not ready to go that high. I'll go up to $750000. I'm feeling confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'll consider a price of $800000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1000000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
