"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I really need to stay within my budget, and I'm not sure I can go as high as $850,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to finalize the sale. Let me know if you're willing to go up to this price.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $780,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $780,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $790,000.  It's a fair compromise and ensures we can both move forward with this deal.  Let me know if this price works for you.",790000.0,Alice,5,
