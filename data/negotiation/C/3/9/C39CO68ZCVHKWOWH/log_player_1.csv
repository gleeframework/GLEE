Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. His response will help determine your next move. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have the safety net of selling to John for $12,000, so you can afford to be a bit bolder in your initial offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a substantial gap between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, indicating room for negotiation.
* **John as Backup:**  You still have the option to sell to John for your minimum price if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget considerations, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  This counteroffer suggests a compromise while still staying closer to your desired price range.  
* **Demonstrating Flexibility:** You're showing Bob that you're willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of a substantial loss.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You're still above your minimum acceptable price, allowing you to potentially negotiate down further or walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to go up to $10,500. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  You are making a profit.
* **Limited Upside:** While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. It's unlikely he'll meet your $11,500 counter, and going below $10,500 might make him walk away.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time. Accepting now secures the sale and avoids the risk of losing Bob altogether."
