"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  Consider this my best offer:  $1150000. This allows you a significant profit margin while also ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
