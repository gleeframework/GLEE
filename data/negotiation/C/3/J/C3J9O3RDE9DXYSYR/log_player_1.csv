Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential. Let me know what you think.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that $875,000 represents a fair price, considering both our interests. This price would allow me to proceed with the purchase and still stay within my financial constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking a lower final offer."
