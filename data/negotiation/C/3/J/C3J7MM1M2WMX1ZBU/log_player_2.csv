"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $200 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way above both your budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit steep for me, though. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly below our budget to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but clearly indicates the initial offer is too high.
* **Aiming for a Deal:** While we have John's offer as backup, getting the product for $80 would be a fantastic deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $80 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $150 is still above both our budget and what John is offering. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice moving down from $200 to $150 suggests she's willing to negotiate. There's a chance of getting a better deal. 
* **John as Backup:** We can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand we both have a price in mind, Alice. How about we settle at $110? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying under our $150 limit.
* **Justification:** By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" we're appealing to a sense of fairness and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts us in a good position for further negotiation if Alice rejects it. We've shown flexibility and have room to increase our offer slightly if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right about finding a compromise, Bob.  How about $130? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Pressure:** Alice is using the ""final offer"" tactic, but we still have rounds and options.
* **Above Budget:** $130 is still $30 more than John's offer and above our ideal price.
* **Calculated Risk:** We're taking a risk by rejecting, but we have a good chance of getting closer to our target, especially since Alice has already come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  I can do $120, but that's really pushing my budget."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Nearing the Limit:** We're inching closer to our absolute maximum, signaling that we're serious but also nearing the end of our flexibility.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning our budget again, we're reiterating our constraints and making it clear we're not just lowballing.
* **Strategic Concession:** We're conceding a smaller increment ($10) this time, showing we're willing to move but not by much. This puts the pressure on Alice to make a similar move if she wants the deal."
