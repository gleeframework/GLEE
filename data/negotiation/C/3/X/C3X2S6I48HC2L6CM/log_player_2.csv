"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards a price that's better for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite & Reasonable:**  It acknowledges Alice's offer and doesn't start with an unreasonably low number.
* **Significant but not Insulting:**  A $2,500 decrease is a strong move, but still leaves room for Alice to counter if she needs to.
* **Tests the Waters:** This first counteroffer helps gauge how much Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is definitely willing to negotiate, but $8,500 is still closer to her starting price than yours. There's room to push further down towards your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice, and I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we try $7,750? That's a significant move on my end while still acknowledging the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Show Willingness to Compromise:**  ""Trying to find a middle ground"" signals you're engaged in good-faith negotiation.
* **Incremental Increase:**  Moving from $7,000 to $7,750 shows flexibility without giving up too much ground.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting it as a ""significant move"" emphasizes your concession.

This offer aims to test if Alice is willing to go below $8,000. If not, we're getting close to the point where John's offer becomes the safer option."
