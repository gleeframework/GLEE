Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product for $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Knowing my backup:** I'm confident that I can get $10,000 from John if Bob rejects my offer, so there's no risk in asking for a higher price. 
* **Hoping for a win-win:**  There's a chance that the product might be worth more than $15,000 to Bob, and he might be willing to pay that price. 

Let's see what Bob decides!"
