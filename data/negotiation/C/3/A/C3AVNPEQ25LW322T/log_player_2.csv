"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $9500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John's $10,000, Bob still has room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it fits my budget perfectly."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price point.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there is a risk that Alice will become unwilling to budge further, or that Bob could end up paying John's higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that is both affordable for Bob and profitable for Alice."
