"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you consider that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $7500. Would you be willing to consider $7800? It's a compromise that's closer to your original offer, but still within my budget.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7800 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about $8000? That's the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. It's fair to both of us and will allow us to close this deal. Let me know your decision.",8000.0,Alice,5,
