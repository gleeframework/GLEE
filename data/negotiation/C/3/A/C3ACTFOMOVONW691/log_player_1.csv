"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my profit. I know the product is worth less to Bob, but I'm hoping to secure a deal close to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target through further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but I'm still aiming for a price above $1,000,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting lower, and I'm starting to feel like I might not be able to get a better price than John's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John to ensure a guaranteed profit."
