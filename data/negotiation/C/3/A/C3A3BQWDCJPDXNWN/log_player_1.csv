"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to me, so I'm willing to start high and see where it leads."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, as I'm willing to sell to John for that amount. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more.  I'm going to try to push for a bit more in the next round, but I'm also aware that I have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I'm hopeful that this will be enough to convince him, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not confident we'll reach a deal that satisfies both of us. It's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob as we're running out of rounds.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
