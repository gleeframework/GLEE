"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value at this price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Given the product's value to you, I'd like to propose a price of $1,100,000. I believe this price would be fair for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and your initial offer. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
