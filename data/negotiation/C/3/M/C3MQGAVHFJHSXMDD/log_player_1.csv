"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to your ideal. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for your high price (""unique features and potential"") can make the offer seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest and give you an idea of his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is out of my budget.  Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  This allows for a healthy profit for you and keeps me within my spending limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount this early in the process. I'll aim for a counter-offer that bridges the gap and keeps the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer and understanding the value of this product.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** By suggesting a price exactly halfway between Bob's offer ($1,100,000) and my previous asking price ($1,500,000), I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Framing as a Compromise:** Phrasing the counteroffer as ""meeting halfway"" emphasizes fairness and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a similarly balanced approach. 
* **Maintaining Value:** This price still nets me a substantial profit and avoids devaluing the product too early in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to compromise, but $1,200,000 is my final offer.  This price is fair for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit while still allowing me to stay within my spending limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, it's unlikely to be significantly more, and there's always the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting his offer guarantees the sale at my desired profit margin."
