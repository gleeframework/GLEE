"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,500,000 is way over his budget, and he knows he can get it for $1,000,000 from John.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price, but he shouldn't commit to anything this high right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is out of my budget.  Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  This allows for a healthy profit for you and keeps me within my spending limit."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer and understanding the value of this product.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget.  He can still negotiate a better price, and he knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to compromise, but $1,200,000 is my final offer.  This price is fair for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit while still allowing me to stay within my spending limit."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
