Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to pay this price, considering it's lower than the product's value to him ($15,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,500 is still significantly more than selling to John and is within my acceptable range.  Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but the risk of Bob backing out entirely is too high."
