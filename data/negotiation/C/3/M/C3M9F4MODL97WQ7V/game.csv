"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. How about we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
