Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is well above my minimum of $80. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not asking for the full $150 value, leaving space for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal and counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive tone to make Bob feel good about the opportunity. 
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$100 is still a good price:** While $100 is lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum of $80 and represents a decent profit. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** However, I believe I can likely get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Bob's interest:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested in the product, making it worth exploring a higher price further.

**Next steps:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your perspective, $100 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? That would be a fair price for both of us, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:**  I'm offering a counter-proposal, aiming for a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Compromise:** This demonstrates willingness to compromise and helps build rapport.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm providing a logical reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing fairness and a win-win situation.
* **Maintaining value:**  $110 is still above my minimum, ensuring I don't settle for less than what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. Would you be willing to consider $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our original offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good price:**  $105 is very close to my desired price of $110 and still significantly higher than my minimum of $80.
* **Potential stalemate:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a stalemate or even a lower offer from Bob.
* **Avoiding risks:**  Selling to John for $80 would be a significant loss compared to accepting Bob's offer.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good deal and avoid risking a lower price or a prolonged negotiation."
