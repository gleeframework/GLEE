"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the product's value, but that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $550,000. Let me know what you think.",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the offer. While $550,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  I'm prepared to lower the price to $900,000. This is still a fair value for the product and allows for a decent profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the offer, but unfortunately, $700,000 is still far too low for me. While I'm open to finding a middle ground,  it's not possible at that price point. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,000,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to respectfully decline your offer.  ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
