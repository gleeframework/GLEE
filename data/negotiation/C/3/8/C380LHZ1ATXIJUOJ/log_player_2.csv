Alice's offer:

I'm prepared to lower the price to $900,000. This is still a fair value for the product and allows for a decent profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the offer, but unfortunately, $700,000 is still far too low for me. While I'm open to finding a middle ground,  it's not possible at that price point. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,000,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to respectfully decline your offer.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much on price. Her final offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000. It makes more financial sense to buy from John and save the $200,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price that's better than John's."
