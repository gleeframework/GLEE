Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's priced at $1,200,000, which I believe reflects its true worth. This price allows for a healthy profit for you while still being within a reasonable range.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Justifying the price:**  I'm providing a reason for the price, highlighting both Bob's potential profit and the product's worth. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The initial offer is not my absolute bottom line. It allows for counteroffers and potential compromise. 
* **Keeping the John option open:**  This offer is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, allowing me to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the product's value, but that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $550,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price:** $550,000 is far below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **I have a better option with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a much higher price.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable,  rejection allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a more agreeable price. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to see if I can negotiate a better price.  However, I'm keeping the option to sell to John open in case negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the offer. While $550,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  I'm prepared to lower the price to $900,000. This is still a fair value for the product and allows for a decent profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:**  I'm  countering with a price significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer,  showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value and profit:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth and the potential profit for Bob to encourage him to reconsider.
* **Keeping the door open:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation but is still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to walk away if Bob continues to refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John offers a much better deal:**  Selling to John guarantees me a significantly higher price.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful:**  Bob's offers have been steadily decreasing, and it's unlikely he will come closer to my desired price. 

At this point, the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing out on John's offer outweighs the potential of getting a higher price from Bob.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and move forward with selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the offer, but unfortunately, $700,000 is still far too low for me. While I'm open to finding a middle ground,  it's not possible at that price point. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,000,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to respectfully decline your offer.  "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This counteroffer establishes a clear boundary and signals that I'm close to my limit.  
* **Significant compromise:**  I'm lowering the price to $1,000,000, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Fair deal:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer, highlighting that it's a win-win situation.
* **Rejection consequence:**  I'm explicitly stating that I will decline if Bob can't meet the price, increasing pressure for a deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  I've secured a decent price and achieved a successful negotiation.
* If Bob rejects:  I'll sell to John for $1,500,000.  This is a higher price, but it's crucial to be decisive and avoid getting caught in a protracted negotiation that could lead to a lower price."
