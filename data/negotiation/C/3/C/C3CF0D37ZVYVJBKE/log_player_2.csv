```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant reduction:**  The counteroffer is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. What are your thoughts?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** Bob is increasing his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate but not giving in completely.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about acquiring the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1225000. This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above Bob's budget, but it's getting closer. Since Bob has a backup option with John for $1,200,000, he can afford to be a bit more cautious and try to negotiate further. There's still a chance to get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. $1,225,000 is close, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $1,200,000 - my final offer.  This is a fair price that allows us to close the deal and avoid any further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
