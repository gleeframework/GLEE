Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and your discerning eye, I'm confident you'll recognize its worth.  I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  The product has a high floor price ($1,000,000) but also significant potential for profit.
* **Bob's Value:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 provides a baseline.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer ($1,800,000) sets an anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Bob doesn't accept this price, it frames the discussion around a higher value.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making the offer seem more desirable. 
* **John as Backup:** Having a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000 eliminates the risk of ending up with nothing.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  It's expected that Bob might negotiate, and you'll need to be prepared to adjust your price accordingly."
