Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I have 8 more rounds and can counter-offer, potentially securing a price closer to $9,000. Selling to John right now would be a loss compared to potential future negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum price, but I've already rejected his offer twice, and it's unlikely he will budge further. With only 6 rounds left, the chance of getting a higher price is slim. Selling to John for $8,000 ensures I don't lose money and allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiations."
