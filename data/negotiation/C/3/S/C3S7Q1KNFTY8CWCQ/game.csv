"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its true worth. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product aligns with my needs, but  $1,500,000 is not feasible for me. I could consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer.  While I understand your perspective, the $600,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product and what it can do.  Let's find a middle ground - would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Perhaps we could agree on $700,000? I think that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming to achieve a price that recognizes the  value of this product. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,5,
