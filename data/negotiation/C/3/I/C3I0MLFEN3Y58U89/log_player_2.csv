"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is an exceptional value, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price, you can do better. John's offer provides a baseline price of $1,000,000. There's room to negotiate with Alice or see if she'll lower her price with a counter-offer."
