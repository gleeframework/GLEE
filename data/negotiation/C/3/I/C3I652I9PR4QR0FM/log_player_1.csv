Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I'm also prepared to sell to John for $120 if I don't feel the negotiation is going in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell the product for less than $120. I'll counter his offer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm willing to lower my price to $125. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get a bit more from Bob, his offers are getting closer to my minimum.  However,  it's becoming clear that he's not willing to meet my price.  I'm not interested in continuing this negotiation any further. I'll sell to John for $120, which is a guaranteed profit."
