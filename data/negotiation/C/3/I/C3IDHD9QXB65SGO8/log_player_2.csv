"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a fallback option with John at $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might prompt her to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $800,000."
