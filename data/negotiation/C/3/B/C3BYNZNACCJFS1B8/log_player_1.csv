"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000.  This is above Bob's value of $800,000, but it gives us room to negotiate. It also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a bit closer to Bob's value. I'm hoping to find a compromise we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still not quite there.  I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  There's still a chance that I could get closer to $1,000,000 with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a good opportunity to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $980,000 is a good offer from Bob, I'm running out of time and want to ensure I get at least my minimum price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to guarantee a profitable sale."
