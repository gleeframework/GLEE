"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
