Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if you're interested.

Bob should buy the product from John. While $9,000 is closer to his target, it's still more than he's willing to pay. John is offering the product for his desired price."
