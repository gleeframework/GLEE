"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential benefits from it.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for reaching out! While I agree the product is great, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering your counteroffer, I'd like to make a new proposal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good middle ground for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that be feasible?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $11,000. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. Considering your offer, I'd like to make a new proposal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new proposal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,200. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",12200.0,Alice,7,
