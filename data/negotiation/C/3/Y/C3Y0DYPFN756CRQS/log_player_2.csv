"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  I can always buy from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a great starting point. I'm interested but would like to offer $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8000 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise.  It's a fair price that's within my budget, and I don't want to risk her walking away and being forced to buy from John for a higher price."
