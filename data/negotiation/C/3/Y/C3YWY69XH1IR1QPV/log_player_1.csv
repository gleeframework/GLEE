"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it immediately. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** My message emphasizes the value of the product, hoping to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

**Note:**  This is a risky strategy.  The initial offer is much higher than Bob's perceived value.  I am hoping to get Bob to see the potential value and start negotiating.  If he immediately rejects, I may have to move quickly to John to secure my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is higher than my minimum price of $1,500,000.  However, it's significantly lower than my initial offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  While selling to John guarantees my minimum price, I believe there's a chance to get a better deal with Bob.  
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show I'm not desperate and am willing to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions.  My goal is to get as close to my initial asking price as possible, while also keeping the deal alive with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm open to dropping my price a little, but I need to be closer to $1,800,000 to make this work. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer immediately, but I'm also not rejecting it outright. This keeps the negotiation open.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and focused on finding a solution that benefits both of us. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to compromise while maintaining a slightly higher price, I can encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer.  If this doesn't work, I can always fall back on John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1600000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above my minimum price of $1,500,000.
* **Progress Made:**  We have made progress in the negotiation, with Bob's offer moving closer to my initial price.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to keep rejecting offers. 
* **Potential for More:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, there's a chance Bob might offer more in subsequent rounds. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer secures a profitable deal while also leaving open the possibility of further negotiation.  The risk of rejecting and potentially having to settle for John's offer is too high at this point."
