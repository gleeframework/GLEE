"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see at least $1,050,000 to make this work.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000.  This price is fair and reflects the value of the product. I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal now.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
