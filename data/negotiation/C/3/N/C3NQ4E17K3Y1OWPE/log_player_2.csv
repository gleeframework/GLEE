"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to revolutionize your business operations. It's a game-changer in its field and we believe it's worth every penny of its $1,000,000 value to you. Considering its immense value, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to you at an introductory price of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still too high.  There's room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to save as much money as possible.  I'll counter with a lower offer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a solution that works for both of us. Given the value of the product, I propose a price of $875,000. This is higher than your offer but still below the product's full value. I believe this could be a fair compromise that allows us to move forward.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

Alice has come down slightly, but I'm still aiming to get a better price.  I'll counter with another offer, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $850,000, which is a significant amount for me.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering the value and benefits of the product, I'm proposing a price of $862,500. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and a decrease from your latest proposal. I hope this figure can help us reach an agreement that satisfies both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now proposing $862,500, which is a good compromise.  I've already made significant progress in the negotiation, and there's a risk of losing the deal if I continue to counteroffer and Alice ultimately decides to go with another buyer. It's time to accept and secure the product."
