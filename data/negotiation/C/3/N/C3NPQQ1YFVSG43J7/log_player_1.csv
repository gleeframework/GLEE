"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is serious about buying the product. If he rejects, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low for me, especially since I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $15,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm countering with $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than John's price, giving me some wiggle room. It also shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum desired value, I'm still hesitant to accept. John's offer is only $500 less, and there are still more rounds to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm countering with $16,000. This is a further compromise, but still significantly higher than John's price, giving me room to potentially gain more in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum desired value, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm also mindful that I have a guaranteed offer from John, which is just $1,500 less than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm countering with $15,500. This is a significant compromise, but still higher than John's offer. It's also close to my minimum desired value and shows Bob I'm serious about reaching a deal. I only have three rounds left to close the deal with Bob, so I need to start making bigger concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left and Bob's offer remaining at $13,000, I'm going to sell to John for $15,000. This is a better deal than Bob's current offer, and I don't have enough time to risk further negotiation with Bob."
