"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $11,250. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable product and me to ensure a reasonable profit. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
