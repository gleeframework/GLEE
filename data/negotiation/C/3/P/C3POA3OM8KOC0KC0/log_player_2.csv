"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives you a chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a strong counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. This sets the stage for negotiation and hopefully gets Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is getting closer to my price range, but I'm not going to accept just yet. There's still room to negotiate.  I want to see if I can get her down to $10,000 or closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but still trying to stay below the $10,000 mark."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now very close to my maximum price. It's risky to keep negotiating and might end up losing the deal. It's time to accept her offer and secure the product."
