"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not comfortable meeting you at $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which was $150. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $137.50. What do you think?",137.5,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $115, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $130. It's a fair price, considering the value it offers. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting a bit tired of negotiating, Bob. I'm willing to make one last compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $127. That's the lowest I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",127.0,Alice,9,
