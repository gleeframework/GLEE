Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $130. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $100, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** The slight discount and phrasing like ""limited time"" might make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have the security of John's offer ($150), so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** You make a $30 profit.
* **Bob negotiates:** You have room to lower the price slightly and still make a profit.
* **Bob rejects:** You sell to John for your minimum acceptable price and still make a profit."
