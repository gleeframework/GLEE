Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the potential value and exclusivity of this product. I'm confident that this investment will pay off handsomely for you in the long run. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and ensures I get as much value as possible. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the ""potential value"" and ""exclusivity"" of the product to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message acknowledges that this is a ""fair price,"" hinting at potential for negotiation.
* **Setting a Deadline (Implied):**  By mentioning John, I create a sense of urgency and imply that I have other options, which may push Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial asking price, hoping to strike a deal closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable offer, it's a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 to make this deal work.  This price still reflects the value and potential of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Offer:** I begin by acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing appreciation for his interest. This shows respect and builds rapport.
* **Counter Offer:** I propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000, which is a reasonable compromise. This price is closer to my initial asking price but still allows for some negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the value and potential of the product to justify the price.
* **Emphasize Win-Win:** I frame the counteroffer as a ""win-win"" for both of us, encouraging a positive and collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1300000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. While I initially aimed for a higher price,  negotiations are a give-and-take process.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and is a good outcome considering the alternative of selling to John for a lower amount."
