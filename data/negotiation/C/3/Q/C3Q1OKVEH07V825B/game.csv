"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm quite interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $13,000, Alice.  While I value the product, I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,,
