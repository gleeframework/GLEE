"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've been thinking, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I think you'll find this price very competitive, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?
