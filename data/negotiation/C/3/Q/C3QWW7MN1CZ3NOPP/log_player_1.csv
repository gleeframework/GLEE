Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the potential value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:

At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would result in a $220,000 loss compared to selling to John.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
