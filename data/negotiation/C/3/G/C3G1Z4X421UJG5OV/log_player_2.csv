# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. He knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the consideration, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good deal for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to get the best deal. Even though Alice has lowered the price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He's better off continuing to negotiate and see if he can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $11,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $10,750?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price again.  I'm still very interested in the product and I think $10,800 is a fair price, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'd be happy to pay $10,700, and hopefully, we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10700}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10650. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he can still get the product from John for $10,000, Alice is now offering a price that's only $650 more than John.  This is a relatively small difference, and given that Bob is getting closer to his target price, it's worth accepting Alice's offer and closing the deal."
