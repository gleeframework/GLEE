"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It's clear this product would be a valuable asset to you.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to get at least $990,000 to make this work. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.",990000.0,Alice,5,
