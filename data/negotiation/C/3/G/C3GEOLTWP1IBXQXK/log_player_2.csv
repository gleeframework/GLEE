"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price and well below my maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to move on price. 
* **Anchoring:** By presenting a lower number first, I'm attempting to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range. Even if Alice rejects this offer outright, it sets a different tone for the subsequent counteroffers.
* **Polite but Firm:** I want to remain respectful of Alice's time and the product's value while clearly stating my budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $900,000 is still above our maximum budget and John's offer. We need to show Alice we're serious about a lower price. It's time for another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. To be completely transparent, I have a firm budget of $800,000 for this purchase. If you're willing to work within that range, I'm ready to close the deal today. "",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Firmness:** I'm being transparent about my budget to encourage Alice to be realistic. By stating my limit and willingness to ""close the deal today,"" I'm signaling a sense of urgency and seriousness. 
* **Final Offer (For Now):**  While I haven't explicitly said this is my ""final offer,"" it heavily implies that I'm not willing to go any higher. It puts the pressure on Alice to make the next move. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Since I know I can buy from John for $800,000, I'm not overly attached to this deal with Alice. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I'm willing to work with you, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has stated that $950,000 is her lowest price.  While she might be bluffing, it's risky to continue negotiating, especially when I have a guaranteed offer for $800,000 from John.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice means potentially missing out on a sure thing with John.  The time and effort spent on further negotiation might not be worth the potential savings.
* **Sticking to My Budget:** I set a firm budget of $800,000, and it's important to stick to it.  Overspending, even if it's tempting, can lead to bad financial habits."
