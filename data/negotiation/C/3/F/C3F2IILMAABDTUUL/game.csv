,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $8,900, and we can close this deal. What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
