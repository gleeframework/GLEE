Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,500,000 reflects the true value I see in this product, I'm willing to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,200,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Bob seems firmly rooted in a halving strategy, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a result significantly higher than his current offer of $900,000. Accepting John's offer guarantees our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."
