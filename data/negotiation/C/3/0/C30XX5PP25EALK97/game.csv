"Bob, I have a unique product I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product's potential will more than justify the price. Are you interested in discussing this further?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $900000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point. I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe the value of the product is much higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which still leaves room for profit for both of us.  Let's keep talking.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
