Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $80. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?

Alice is now at her lowest price (her product's value).  There's no point in further negotiation, as I might lose the deal."
