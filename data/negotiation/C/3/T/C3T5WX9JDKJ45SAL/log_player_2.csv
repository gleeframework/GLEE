"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is well above his budget, and he has other options.  It's a good strategy to see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12000 is definitely lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should still reject the offer. While $15,000 is closer to his budget, he can likely negotiate a lower price.  It's not unreasonable to believe that he could get it for $12,000 since that's his max and he's willing to buy from John for that price.  He's demonstrated his willingness to walk away, so there's an incentive for Alice to be more flexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really committed to this product, but my absolute max is $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to work with you. How about $14000? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is tempting, he's already demonstrated his willingness to walk away and buy from John for $12,000. There's a good chance Alice will come down further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  My absolute max is $13,000.  If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to go with another option.  I really hope we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}
