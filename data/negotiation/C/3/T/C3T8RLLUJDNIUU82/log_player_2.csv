"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is still too high, especially since he knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $7,500 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a bold step here by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This reflects his understanding that the product is worth less to Alice, and he's aiming to maximize his savings.  This counteroffer is within his budget and leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $8,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's preferred price. At $8,500, Bob is getting a good deal and saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  It's worth accepting this offer before risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a higher price or losing the opportunity altogether."
