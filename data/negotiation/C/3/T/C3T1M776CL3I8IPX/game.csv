"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as 120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 140? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal on this amazing product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $130?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I can make the purchase today.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as 130. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. How about we try 135? It's a fair price, and I think you'll still get a great deal on this amazing product.",135.0,Alice,5,
