Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. Looking forward to your positive response.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000.  While John is willing to sell for $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $300,000.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice."
