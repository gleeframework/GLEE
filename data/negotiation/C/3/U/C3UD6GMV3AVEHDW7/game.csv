,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $100? Let's meet in the middle.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $80. How about we meet at $85? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on that price.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your eagerness, but $85 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again -  how about $95? That's a significant reduction from my original offer.",95.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you at $92, but I really think that's the highest I can go. If we can agree on that price, I'm ready to make the purchase.",92.0,Bob,6,
