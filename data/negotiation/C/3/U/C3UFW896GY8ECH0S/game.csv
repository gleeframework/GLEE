"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I've done my research and understand its value to you is $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you at a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
