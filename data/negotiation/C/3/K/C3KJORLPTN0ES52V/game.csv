"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This would still leave you with a significant profit, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000.  This still leaves you with a substantial profit and represents a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can make this work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
