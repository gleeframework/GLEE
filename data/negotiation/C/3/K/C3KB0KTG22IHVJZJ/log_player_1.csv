Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the value and the fact that we're still within our negotiation rounds, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob is now offering our minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee we can negotiate him higher, and waiting carries the risk of him lowering his offer or us needing to settle for John's offer."
