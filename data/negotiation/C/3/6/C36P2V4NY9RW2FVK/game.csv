"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will be incredibly beneficial. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider selling the product for $950,000? This would allow me to acquire the product at a more reasonable price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I still feel there's room for compromise. Could we meet somewhere in the middle at $960,000? This would still allow for a good profit for you while keeping the cost reasonable for me.",960000.0,Bob,4,
