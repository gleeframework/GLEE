Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $975,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $975,000. While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal compared to John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
