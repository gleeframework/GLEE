"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $975,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",975000.0,Alice,5,
