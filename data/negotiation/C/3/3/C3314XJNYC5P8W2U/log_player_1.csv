Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to maximize potential profit.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $100 is a fair starting point, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The message encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 

**Next Steps:**

I will wait for Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind the $80 fallback option with John."
