"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,600,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential returns.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. I can do $950,000. This is a strong offer, and I hope we can make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm willing to consider $1,250,000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
