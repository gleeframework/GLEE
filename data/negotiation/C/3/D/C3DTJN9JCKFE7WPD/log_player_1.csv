"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business, and I'm happy to discuss a deal that works for both of us. To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** While the opening price is high, framing it as a starting point for discussion and emphasizing the product's value to Bob softens the blow.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind you have the John option as a strong backup, allowing you to be firm in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's price, it's still early in the negotiation. There's potential for Bob to go higher, especially since he seems interested in the product. Rejecting this offer signals that you see the product's value beyond this initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $100,000 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above Bob's offer. 
* **Middle Ground:**  Proposing a price in the middle aims to find a compromise. It signals you're serious about making a deal but not desperate enough to accept his initial offer.
* **Maintaining Value:** The message reinforces the product's high value, subtly pushing Bob to reconsider his budget limitations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's counteroffers are increasing, but at a slow pace. This suggests there's more room for negotiation.
* **Time Consideration:** While we're getting closer to John's price, we still have several rounds left to potentially secure a better deal from Bob.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Accepting this offer too quickly might signal that you're willing to go even lower. Holding firm keeps the pressure on Bob to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show I'm serious about getting this deal done, I'll come down to $1,325,000. This is my final offer, as I need to be mindful of my own bottom line."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** Introducing a sense of urgency and finality often pushes the other party to make a decision.
* **Strategic Concession:** A smaller concession ($75,000) shows you're getting closer to your limit, but the compromise keeps the negotiation alive.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The uneven number ($1,325,000) feels more considered and less like a round figure that could be negotiated down further. 
* **Maintaining Value:** The message still emphasizes the need to protect your own interests, reinforcing the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has returned to his original offer of $1,200,000, indicating he may be unwilling to move significantly higher. 
* **Final Offer Ignored:** Bob rejected your ""final offer,"" which suggests he's comfortable risking the deal.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of a lower final price or a failed deal, costing you time and potentially a better offer from John.
* **Guaranteed Value:** Selling to John guarantees your desired minimum price of $1,200,000. It eliminates further negotiation and the risk of losing out. 

At this point, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential, but uncertain, upside of continuing with Bob."
