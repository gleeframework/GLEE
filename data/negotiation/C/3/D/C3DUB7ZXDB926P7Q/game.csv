"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counteroffer at $110. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from your new offer. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll counteroffer at $115. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me here.",115.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still need to make some room in my budget. How about $112?",112.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer, Bob. I think $115 is a fair price for this product, and I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the point where I might need to consider other buyers. I'll stick with my previous counteroffer of $115. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",115.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer. How about $112.50?",112.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to lose patience, Bob. I've already made several concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower than $115. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need you to meet me at $114. If you're not willing to do that, I'll have to consider other options.",114.0,Alice,9,
