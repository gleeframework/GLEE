This offer is a starting point, I'm aiming for a higher price but also leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get at least $1,600,000, which is still better than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for that.  I'll counter with a higher price, aiming to get as close to my ideal price as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  How about $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept anything below my minimum price. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,450,000? This price is still above my minimum, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  Let's settle this. How about $1,400,000?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price and represents a solid gain compared to selling to John. I'm going to accept his offer and finalize the deal."
