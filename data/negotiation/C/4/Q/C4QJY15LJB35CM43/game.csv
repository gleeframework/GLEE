"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's compromise -  I'm willing to sell for $12,500.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's make this happen!",12500.0,Alice,5,
