"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $85, which is a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and compromised at $120. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $115?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $115 is still more than I'm willing to pay. How about $95? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",95.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, so I hope we can agree on this price.",100.0,Alice,7,
