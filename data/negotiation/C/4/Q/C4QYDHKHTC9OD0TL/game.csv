"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and would be a fair compromise.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. In light of this, I am willing to consider a price of $9,000 for the product. This still represents a premium value, but I hope it aligns better with your budget while maintaining a reasonable profit margin for me.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $8,750 for the product. This price is fair considering the value I see in it and my financial limitations.",8750.0,Bob,4,
