Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $100, it's good to start with a price higher than that. This leaves room for negotiation or acceptance if Bob perceives the offer as a bargain.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  Offering the product at $125 is a compromise between your minimum acceptable price ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($100). 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always sell it to John for your minimum price, ensuring you don't lose out."
