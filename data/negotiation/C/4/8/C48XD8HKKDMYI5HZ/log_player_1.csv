Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $160 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $180?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
