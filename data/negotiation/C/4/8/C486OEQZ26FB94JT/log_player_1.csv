{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $95. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm not comfortable going above $90 for this product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and I don't think I'll be able to get a better price from him. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for a guaranteed $100."
