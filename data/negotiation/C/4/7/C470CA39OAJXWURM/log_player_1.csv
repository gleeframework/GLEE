Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly refusing to budge beyond $750,000.  While future offers might go slightly higher, it's unlikely he'll reach our $800,000 minimum.  John offers a guaranteed $800,000, which ensures we don't lose money and avoids further negotiation hassle."
