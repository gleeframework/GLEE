Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me. How about $10,500? That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,200 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can push for a slightly higher amount. I'll counter his offer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,200 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $10,350? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10350}
