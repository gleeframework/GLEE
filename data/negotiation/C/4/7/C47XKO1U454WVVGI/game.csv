,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the value it offers.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still quite low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I'm trying to be as close to the middle as possible, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
