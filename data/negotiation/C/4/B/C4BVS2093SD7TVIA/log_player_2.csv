"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her, and even lower than your own valuation.  There's a good chance she'll be willing to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows for potentially getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and it's the highest I can go at the moment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1350000 is your highest offer, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $1,300,000 is a significant savings compared to buying from John.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk she'll reject my next offer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids further risk."
