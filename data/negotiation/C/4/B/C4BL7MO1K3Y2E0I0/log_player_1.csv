"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate and I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,550,000 for this product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1,550,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,550,000, so I'll offer $1,425,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price,  $1,425,000 is still below my desired amount. I believe I can continue to negotiate and potentially get a higher offer from Bob. I also still have a safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $1,425,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to go down to $1,500,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a very valuable product, and I believe this price reflects that.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, we're still too far apart.  I've already lowered my price significantly, and I don't want to risk going lower and ending up with a deal that's not worth it.  John is willing to pay my minimum asking price, and it's better to secure a guaranteed sale now than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially miss out on a better deal."
