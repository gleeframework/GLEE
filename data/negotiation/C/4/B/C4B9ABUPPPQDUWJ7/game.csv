,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as I believe that's a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However,  $850,000 falls quite short of what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I recognize the value of your product, $1,150,000 is still above my budget. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This represents a significant step towards your price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find common ground.  To show I'm serious about making this work, I'll come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
