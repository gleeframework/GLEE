Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe could be a significant asset to your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000.  This price reflects the product's true value and potential for growth. I'm confident that this is a deal you won't want to miss. Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's potential and value to Bob. This can create a sense of urgency and make him more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm  leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.  
* **Plan B:** I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further if needed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** I believe there's room to negotiate with Bob. He's shown interest and is willing to talk.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective on the market value, this particular product has unique features and potential that set it apart.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects a fair price for its value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset to your business, and I'm eager to see it succeed. Let's continue this discussion."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show appreciation:** Acknowledging Bob's offer shows respect and builds rapport.
* **Counter with a justified price:** I'm dropping my price but not too far. I explain the rationale behind the new price, emphasizing the product's unique qualities and potential.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing the potential for both of us to gain from the deal. This can make Bob more receptive to my offer.
* **Maintain open communication:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1000000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's features and potential benefits. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'd like to see some movement on the price. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  While there is room for further negotiation, it's unlikely Bob will go much higher. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay $800,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a price that is significantly better than what John is offering, and it minimizes the risk of further negotiation.

**Conclusion:**  It's a strategic decision to accept Bob's offer, as it balances the desire for a higher price with the need to secure a sale and avoid potential delays."
