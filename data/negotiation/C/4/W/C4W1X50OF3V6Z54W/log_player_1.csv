Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how Alice should approach this offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell below $12,000 because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so he won't pay more.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $10,000 and $12,000.

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal. Offering a price too close to $12,000 risks Bob walking away immediately.

**Here's a possible offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I'm valuing it at $12,000, but I'm willing to offer you a special price of $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning**

* **Starting High:** The initial mention of $12,000 sets an anchor price in Bob's mind.
* **Discounted Offer:**  $11,500 gives Bob a perceived discount, making the deal more enticing.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties adds a time pressure element, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Alice could start with a higher offer and leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter."
