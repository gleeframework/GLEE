Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for potential negotiation. I'm aiming to get as much as possible, but I'm also aware that I can always fall back to John's offer of $150 if Bob proves unwilling to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is too low for me.  I'm going to try to get a better price by counter-offering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counter-offering with $175. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it's a more reasonable compromise than Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer of $140 is still below what I initially hoped for, it is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiations and the potential for Bob to walk away."
