"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is better than $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows the product is worth $12,000 to him and that John is willing to sell it for that price. Therefore, Bob starts by offering the lowest possible price he's willing to pay, hoping Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but $14,000 is still over his budget. It's better to continue negotiating and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price, but he needs to start inching towards Alice's asking price.  Offering $12,500 shows that he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to save some money. It's a reasonable middle ground that could potentially get Alice to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's budget. While it's tempting to accept, Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate.  There are still rounds remaining, and Bob should continue trying to get a lower price. It's likely that Alice is starting to feel the pressure and may come down further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to negotiate a lower price, but he's starting to run out of time.  He's also aware that he can always buy from John for $12,000, so there's less risk in offering a slightly higher price. Offering $13,000 shows that he's serious about buying the product from Alice, but it's still within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at her initial price of $15,000, which is above Bob's budget.  He has only a few rounds left, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. It's time to cut his losses and buy from John for $12,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
