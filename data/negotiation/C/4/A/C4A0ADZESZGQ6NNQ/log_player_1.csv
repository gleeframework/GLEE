Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room for potential compromise. It also opens the conversation by acknowledging the value of the product, aiming to pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $750000, considering my budget and the market value. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a substantial amount, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000. It's worth exploring further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $750,000 is a good starting point, I'm not able to go that low just yet. Given the unique value proposition of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects a significant discount, but still ensures I receive a fair return on my investment. I believe this is a win-win scenario for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $800000, which reflects a good compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum value requirement. It's a fair price and ensures I don't lose out on a valuable product. Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal without further negotiation and move on to other opportunities."
