"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value and potential. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $750000, considering my budget and the market value. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $750000 is a good starting point, I'm not able to go that low just yet. Given the unique value proposition of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price reflects a significant discount, but still ensures I receive a fair return on my investment. I believe this is a win-win scenario for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $800000, which reflects a good compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
