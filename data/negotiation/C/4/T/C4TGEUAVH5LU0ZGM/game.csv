"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000 to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This price reflects the product's exceptional qualities and future prospects.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and my financial constraints.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
