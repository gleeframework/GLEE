"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. This is my final offer. ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $14000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your offer.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you the product for $13500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.",13500.0,Alice,5,
