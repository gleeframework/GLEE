Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she's unwilling to go substantially lower than $1,000,000.  At this point, it's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000.  You'll save $200,000 and avoid potentially wasting more time in a negotiation that's unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome."
