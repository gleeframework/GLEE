"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $950000. This is getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm willing to consider it. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're still far apart, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $900000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping you'll meet me at this price. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",900000.0,Alice,9,
