"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This price reflects the product's worth while staying within a reasonable range for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the effort, I still believe we can find a solution that suits both of us. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while keeping it within my financial limits.",9500.0,Bob,4,
