Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but lower than my minimum acceptable price.  This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,500. This is a compromise, lower than my initial offer but still higher than his offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while giving me a good profit."
