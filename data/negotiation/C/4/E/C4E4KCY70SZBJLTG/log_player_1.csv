"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I'm willing to be flexible if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept it immediately. I want to see if I can get a bit more. I have 9 rounds left, so I have some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise - higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and hopefully close the deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $16,000, which is higher than John's offer of $15,000. I'm going to accept Bob's offer because it's a good deal for me, and I want to close the deal sooner rather than later.  We've been through four rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
