"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's lower than John's price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still be getting a great deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is still higher than Bob's ideal price but closer to his $85 counteroffer.  It's also lower than John's price of $100. Accepting the offer is the best option for Bob, as he gets a good deal without further negotiation."
