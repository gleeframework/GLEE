,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $10500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the industry standards. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $9200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider that?",9200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $10000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement at this price. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the industry standards. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,9,
