"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a competitive price given its unique capabilities. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a more favorable price before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $1250000 for the product. This reflects the value it brings and allows for a fair deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further. There's a chance you can get closer to your target price of $1,000,000.  You can also always fallback to buying from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
