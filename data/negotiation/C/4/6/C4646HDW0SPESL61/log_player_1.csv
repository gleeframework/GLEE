Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value the product holds for Bob, making it a more persuasive opening offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1150000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and leaves little room for negotiation. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This is still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, accepting his offer ensures I don't lose out on the deal and still make a decent profit.  It also avoids further negotiation and potential delays."
