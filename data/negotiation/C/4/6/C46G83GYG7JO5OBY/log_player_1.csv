Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more than that. 
* **High Starting Point:** $140 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still ensures you get a good price.
* **Not Too High:** Setting the price too close to $150 might immediately discourage Bob, even if he's willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring you don't lose the sale to John."
