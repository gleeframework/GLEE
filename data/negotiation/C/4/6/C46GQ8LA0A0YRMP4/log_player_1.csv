Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and features. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $18,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $20,000. This price reflects the true value and the benefit you'll gain from it."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $20,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $19,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and while it's not ideal to lose $1,000, accepting his offer of $19,000 is better than risking a sale to John at $15,000."
