"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering your interest, I'd like to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than the product's value to Bob, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to get the product for $1,000,000 from John, saving him $200,000."
