"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to pay closer to $750000. This seems like a fair price considering the value to me, and allows us both to profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a fair price that still allows us to both profit.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $850000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. How about $800000? This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to get the product at a price I'm comfortable with and for you to make a good profit.  Let's find a way to make this deal happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
