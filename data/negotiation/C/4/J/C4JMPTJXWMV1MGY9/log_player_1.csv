Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000, reflecting its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High Starting Point:** $950,000 is a strong opening offer. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is very interested. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly justifying the high price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:**  You make a profit of $950,000, which is excellent.
* **Bob negotiates:** You have room to lower the price slightly and still make a profit above your guaranteed $1,000,000.
* **Bob rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000."
