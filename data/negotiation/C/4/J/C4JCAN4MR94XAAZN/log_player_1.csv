{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $150. I think it's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $150 gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and creating a sense of urgency (confidence that Bob will find it valuable).
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not stating this is my ""final offer"", leaving the door open for negotiation.

**Important:**  This is a starting point. I will need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and my assessment of his potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for higher price:** Bob has shown interest in the product and is willing to negotiate.  This suggests there's a possibility of finding a price closer to my desired range.
* **No immediate urgency:** I can afford to wait and see if Bob is willing to increase his offer. 

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer, but I will be cautious to avoid pushing him away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $110? I believe this is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm not going down to Bob's initial offer, but I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to his price.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" to remind him of the product's worth.
* **Maintain positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and encouraging further negotiation.

**Next Step:** I'll be watching closely for Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he's still unwilling to budge, I might have to consider selling to John at $120. However, I'm still hopeful that we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still only comfortable paying $90.  I think that's a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm hoping to get out of the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum of $120, it's still below it. I'm not willing to accept a loss on the product. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, suggesting he may be willing to increase his offer again.
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed $120 from John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer.

**Next Step:** I'll make a counteroffer, potentially closer to $100, but I'll be mindful of Bob's budget and  willingness to go higher. I'll also keep John as my fallback option if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference and go with $100? This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  I'm eager to get this product into your hands, so I'm open to making this deal work. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, demonstrating a genuine willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value and eagerness:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and expressing my desire to reach an agreement, subtly putting pressure on him to accept.
* **Open to closing the deal:**  I'm framing the offer as a way to ""make this deal work,"" implying that I'm ready to finalize the transaction. 

**Next Step:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to close the deal. If Bob rejects it, I might need to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price and don't want to risk losing too much."
