"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the product's value, $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,225,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which would be a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
