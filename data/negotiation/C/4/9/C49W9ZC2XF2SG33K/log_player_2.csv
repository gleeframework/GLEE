"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $64. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $64
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $64. This is a good deal, but you can likely get it for even less.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows you to try and save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55}
``` 

I'm offering $55. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still a fair price for both of us.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, and we'll see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $60, which is a good price for me. It's not as low as I was hoping for, but it's still a good deal, and it saves me money compared to buying from John.  I'm going to accept this offer."
