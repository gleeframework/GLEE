"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum price. I'll counter with a price of $9,500. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $8,750. This is a significant step towards meeting your needs, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'll meet you at $9,250, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is a good price for both of us, allowing you to sell quickly and me to get a great deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $9,000 just yet. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'll meet you at $9,500, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Alice,7,
