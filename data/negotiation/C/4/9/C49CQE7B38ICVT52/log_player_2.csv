"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting the initial offer and negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum price. I'll counter with a price of $9,500. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than his comfortable range.  He has several rounds remaining, and it's worth exploring if he can further negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $8,750. This is a significant step towards meeting your needs, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'll meet you at $9,250, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget, but Alice is getting closer to his ideal price.  He can continue to negotiate, aiming to drive the price down further. There are still rounds left, so he can afford to be patient and see if he can close the deal at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is a good price for both of us, allowing you to sell quickly and me to get a great deal. Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $9,000 just yet. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'll meet you at $9,500, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $9,500 is still above Bob's preferred range. While Bob has been successfully negotiating the price down, there are only a few rounds left, and the risk of not closing a deal with Alice increases.  At this point, it's more financially beneficial for Bob to buy from John for $12,000, securing the product and avoiding further negotiation."
