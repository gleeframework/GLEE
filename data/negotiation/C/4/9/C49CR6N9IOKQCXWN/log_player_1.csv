Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  However, $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  What do you think?

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $7,000?  That feels like a fair deal to me.
