"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're aiming to pay no more than $800,000, and $950,000 is significantly over that. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  Knowing you can get the product for $800,000 from John gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. I'm willing to offer you that amount, which is still a great deal considering your valuation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I understand your budget constraints. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's come down from her initial offer, $900,000 is still above your budget. 
* **Further negotiation is likely.** Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, and you have more rounds to work with.
* **John's offer remains a secure option.**  You have the security of John's offer if you can't get a better price from Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still above what I can afford. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering your valuation and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $875,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your budget.** $875,000 is only $75,000 over your ideal price.
* **You have more rounds left.**  There's still room to negotiate, and Alice has indicated this is her final offer, meaning a counteroffer could be effective.
* **John's offer is still a backup.**  You can always purchase from John if you can't get a better deal with Alice. 

**Counter-offer Strategy:**  

In this situation, a counter-offer is the best option. You've shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has demonstrated a desire to close the deal.  You could try a counter-offer of $850,000, which would be a compromise between your target and Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit away from my budget.  I'm willing to go to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering your valuation and my limitations.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I've already made a significant concession. I'm not willing to go any lower than $875,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support package. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm on her price.** Despite the added extras, she's not budging on the $875,000 price.
* **Time is running out.** You're down to only 3 rounds remaining.
* **John's offer is a safe and secure deal.**  You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John, and there's no guarantee you can get a better deal with Alice.

While $875,000 is close to your budget, the risk of not getting a better price and running out of rounds makes buying from John the safest and most logical option at this point."
