Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we've been dancing around the price for a while, Bob. I'm not willing to meet you at $800,000, but I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $815,000. That's my final offer.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000

It's unlikely Alice will go any lower. Accepting at $815,000 secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal by going into the final round."
