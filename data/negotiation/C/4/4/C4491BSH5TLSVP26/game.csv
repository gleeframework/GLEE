"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this valuable product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm sticking with my offer of $750,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
