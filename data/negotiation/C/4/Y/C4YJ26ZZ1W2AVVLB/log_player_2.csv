"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $135 is better than Alice's initial asking price of $150, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but I'm only able to go up to $120 for this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I value this product at more than $120, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $130? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $130, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  At this point, Bob has two options:

* **Continue negotiating:**  This could potentially lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee. There's also a risk of Alice getting frustrated and ending the negotiation.
* **Buy from John:** This guarantees Bob gets the product for his desired price.

Given the risk of further negotiation and the certainty of getting the product for his budget with John, Bob's best option is to buy from John."
