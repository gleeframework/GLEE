"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's not worth selling to Bob for $14,000 as John is willing to pay $15,000. However, Bob's offer shows he's interested, so I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $16,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $15,200. I hope we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,200 is higher than what John is willing to pay.  It's a good deal for me, so I'll accept it."
