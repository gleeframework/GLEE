"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, given its value to me.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was hoping we could meet at a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll meet you at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,500.  This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction.",11500.0,Bob,4,
