"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'd like to propose a compromise. I'll meet you at $1,250,000. This is a fair price that balances the value of the product with your budget. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm very close to my budget limit, but I think we can find a middle ground.  How about $1,225,000? This is a fair price that's only $25,000 from your last offer, and I believe it shows my commitment to reaching a deal. What do you think?",1225000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I'll meet you at $1,200,000. I'm willing to give you a bit of a discount to get the deal done, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,7,
