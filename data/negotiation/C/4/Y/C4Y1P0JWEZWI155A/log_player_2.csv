"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still above my desired price range.  I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $875,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is closer to my desired price range, I'm still hoping to get it lower. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $860,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $860,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $870,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $870,000, which is very close to my counteroffer of $860,000. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in a few thousand dollars more or less. It's time to accept the offer and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer again or having to buy from John for a much higher price."
