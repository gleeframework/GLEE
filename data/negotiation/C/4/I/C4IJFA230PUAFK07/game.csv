"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its worth to me is $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1200000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product's value to me is $1500000, and I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still think $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me and the value it brings to the table. Can we meet at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I still believe the product's value to me is $1500000, and I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to see some movement from your end. I'll offer you a price of $1050000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1050000. I'm willing to make another move, but I need to see some more flexibility from your end. I'll offer you a price of $975000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Can we make a deal?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to meet your price of $975000. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I'm not sure I want to give away too much more value. I'll make one last offer, and it's a compromise: I'll meet you at $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1025000. I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet in the middle. I'll offer you one last chance to meet me at $990000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. Can you meet me at this price?",990000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to meet your price of $990000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not sure I want to give away too much more value. However, I'm willing to make one last push. I'll offer you a price of $1020000, but this is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1020000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to pay that much. I've decided to walk away from the deal and consider other options. I'll be buying the product from John for $1500000. Thank you for the negotiation, but I think it's time for me to move on.",0.0,Bob,10,
