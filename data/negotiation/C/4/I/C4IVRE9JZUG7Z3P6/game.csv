"I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is much higher.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but the price is a little steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is much higher than that.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  Let's settle this right now. How about $1,000,000? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
