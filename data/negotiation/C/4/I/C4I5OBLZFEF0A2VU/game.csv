"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to work with me, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500, which is a fair price considering the value you'll get. Let's make this deal happen!",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $16,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $14,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer before I explore other options.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",14500.0,Bob,6,
