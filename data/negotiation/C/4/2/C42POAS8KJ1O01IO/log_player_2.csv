"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000 vs. $1,500,000).  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives me the opportunity to potentially get a better deal.  While buying from John is always an option, it's not the most financially advantageous choice at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. Given the product's value and what it's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's true worth and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,350,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account the negotiation and compromise we've reached so far. I'm open to further discussion and hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  While I could potentially negotiate further, accepting her offer at $1,350,000 saves me $150,000 compared to buying from John.  This is a significant savings and a good compromise given the negotiating process."
