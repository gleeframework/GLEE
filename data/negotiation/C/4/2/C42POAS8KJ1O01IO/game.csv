"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. Given the product's value and what it's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's true worth and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,350,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account the negotiation and compromise we've reached so far. I'm open to further discussion and hope we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
