Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting ripped off.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures you're still making a profit even if Bob accepts right away.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is too low, below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more than that to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still committed to staying within my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,500 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $10,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. To ensure I get the best possible price, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000.  It's a guaranteed profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
