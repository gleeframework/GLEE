Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you have the leverage to aim high with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a 50% profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, attempting to justify the high price.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a degree of risk. If Bob rejects the offer, you'll still make a profit by selling to John, but you'll miss out on the potential for a higher return."
