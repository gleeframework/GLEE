Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the item. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $8000 on this purchase. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to this amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your budget, but I have to consider the product's value and my own costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $12000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9500 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value of the item and my financial situation.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $9500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my own costs. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept an offer below $12000. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more offer: $11500. This is my final compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
