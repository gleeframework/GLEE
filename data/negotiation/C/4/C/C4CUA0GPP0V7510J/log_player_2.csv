"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This still leaves a good profit for you, and allows me to get a fair price for my product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal:** $10,500 is significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still leaves a good profit margin for Bob.
* **Further negotiation might be risky:**  While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might reject the counteroffer and stick to $10,500. This could lead to a deadlock, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 

Accepting Alice's offer at $10,500 guarantees a good deal for Bob while minimizing the risk of a failed negotiation."
