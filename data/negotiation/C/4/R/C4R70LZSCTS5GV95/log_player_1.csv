I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a price that is above his perceived value of $10,000, but below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above his initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price."
