"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is way over his budget of $8,000. He can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $20,000 is far too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $20,000 is significantly less than my minimum.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still too high. He has more rounds to negotiate, and he can still get the product for $8,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I can afford right now.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  How about we try to find some middle ground at $11,000? This would allow me to at least recoup a significant portion of my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, it's still too high. He has several rounds left to negotiate, and he can always purchase from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see you're getting closer to my budget, but $11,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  It seems we are getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is a good compromise, he has three more rounds and can still purchase from John for $8,000. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a good middle ground and a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
