"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $20,000 is far too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can make this work.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $20,000 is significantly less than my minimum.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I can afford right now.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  How about we try to find some middle ground at $11,000? This would allow me to at least recoup a significant portion of my investment.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see you're getting closer to my budget, but $11,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  It seems we are getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000?  This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a good middle ground and a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,8,
