Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $20,000 is far too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $20,000 is significantly less than my minimum.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I can afford right now.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  How about we try to find some middle ground at $11,000? This would allow me to at least recoup a significant portion of my investment."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see you're getting closer to my budget, but $11,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  It seems we are getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000?  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a good middle ground and a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While it's less than I hoped for, getting $9,500 is significantly better than risking a lower offer in the next rounds or even losing Bob as a buyer. It's time to close the deal."
