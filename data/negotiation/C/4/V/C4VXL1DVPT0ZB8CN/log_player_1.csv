Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price that leaves some room for negotiation, but it's still above my minimum value of $120. I believe this will be attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price, considering that he values the product at $150 and I'm already willing to sell it for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  There is not much room for further negotiation, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether. Accepting his offer is the best decision, ensuring I receive a profitable sale."
