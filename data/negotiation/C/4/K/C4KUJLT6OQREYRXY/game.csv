"Alice, I understand you're at your lowest price, but I'm still just a bit over my budget. If you're willing to go down to $10250, we can close this deal.  It's a fair compromise for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest offer. I'll offer the product to you for $10675. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10675.0,Alice,7,
