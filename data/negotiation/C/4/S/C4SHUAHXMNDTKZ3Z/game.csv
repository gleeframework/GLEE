"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. To start, let's say we aim for a price that reflects its true worth while ensuring both of us are satisfied. How about we discuss it over the next few rounds?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline the $85 offer. My valuation of the product is higher due to its unique features and benefits. I would like to propose $90 as a counteroffer. This allows us to maintain a fair transaction while reflecting the product's value to me.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit more than I can justify at the moment.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Bob. I've considered your proposal and am willing to meet you closer to my valuation. I would like to suggest $92.5 as a counteroffer. This brings us closer together while still acknowledging the product's value to me.",92.5,Alice,5,
