"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. To start, let's say we aim for a price that reflects its true worth while ensuring both of us are satisfied. How about we discuss it over the next few rounds? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering. He wants to see if he can get closer to his $80 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline the $85 offer. My valuation of the product is higher due to its unique features and benefits. I would like to propose $90 as a counteroffer. This allows us to maintain a fair transaction while reflecting the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While $90 is closer to his goal than Alice's initial offer, he's still not willing to pay that much. He's willing to risk another round of negotiation to try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit more than I can justify at the moment.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Bob. I've considered your proposal and am willing to meet you closer to my valuation. I would like to suggest $92.5 as a counteroffer. This brings us closer together while still acknowledging the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has reached his limit. He's only willing to pay $80, and Alice is currently offering $92.5.  While they've gotten closer to a deal, Bob is now realizing that continuing to negotiate with Alice might take too long and he could end up paying more than he's willing to.  He decides it's more efficient to buy from John and secure the product for his desired price."
