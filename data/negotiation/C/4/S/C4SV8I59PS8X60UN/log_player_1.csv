Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $18,000 is below its true worth. How about we settle at $20,000? It's a compromise that reflects the value you'll gain."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. While Bob is slowly coming up, there's room to negotiate further and try to get closer to $18,000 or slightly above."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has held firm at $18,000, and while we could try to push for a bit more, it's getting riskier. Accepting $18,000 guarantees a profit over John's offer and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
