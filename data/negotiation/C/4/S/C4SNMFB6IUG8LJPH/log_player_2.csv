Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is within your budget and a decent compromise. It's unlikely you'll get a significantly better price, especially since you can always buy from John for $15,000."
