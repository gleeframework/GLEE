Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a significant decrease from the initial $18,000, it's still above his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price closer to his $8,000 limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I can offer you a price of $13,500, which is a compromise between our last two offers. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. 

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still too high for Bob, and he's already made a counteroffer that Alice rejected. It's clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower than $13,500, and Bob is unwilling to go higher than $12,000. This means they're unlikely to reach an agreement.

Since John is offering the product for $8,000, which is well within Bob's budget, it's the best option for him. He can save $5,500 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
