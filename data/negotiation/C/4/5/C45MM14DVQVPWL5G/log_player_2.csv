"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This offer is still within Bob's budget and leaves some room for Alice to counter without losing too much profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer slightly. While it is still a better price than John's, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already offered $10,500. Alice countered with $12,500.  By increasing his offer to $11,000, Bob is showing willingness to compromise while staying within his budget and leaving space for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,800 is still within Bob's budget and getting closer to his desired price.  While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, continuing to reject offers risks Alice walking away or Bob running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product for a price he can comfortably afford."
