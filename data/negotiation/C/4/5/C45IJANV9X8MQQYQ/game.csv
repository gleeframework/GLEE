"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",82.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer the product to you for $80, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's the same price John is willing to pay, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",80.0,Alice,5,
