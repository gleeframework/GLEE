"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $11,000?  I'm confident this price would be fair for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll receive.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal work.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,250. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this agreement.",12250.0,Alice,5,
