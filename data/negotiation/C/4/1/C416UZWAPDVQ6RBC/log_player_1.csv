Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my current budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value to me and the cost to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,350,000. This price is still significantly below its worth to you, but it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
