Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1300000 is unfortunately too low for me.  To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1350000. This price is still significantly below its worth to you, but it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this point.
