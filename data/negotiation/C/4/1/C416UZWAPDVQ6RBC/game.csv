"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product at a price that's significantly lower than its worth to you. I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my current budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value to me and the cost to you.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1300000 is unfortunately too low for me.  To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1350000. This price is still significantly below its worth to you, but it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this point.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
