"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's significantly above my minimum threshold but still leaves room for negotiation,  and it demonstrates my willingness to compromise.  We'll see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to settle that quickly. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $920,000 is getting closer to my goal, I believe I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $935,000 for the product. This seems like a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on it."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $915,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'm still not thrilled with the price,  $915,000 is getting very close to my minimum threshold and I don't want to risk losing the deal.  We've already gone through several rounds, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a better price.  It's time to secure the sale and take the profit."
