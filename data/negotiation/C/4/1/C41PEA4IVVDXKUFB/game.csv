"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $16,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $13,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,500 is too low for me. How about we settle at $15,000? That's my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
