"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and upfront, but I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. This will hopefully encourage him to consider my offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500:** This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.  
* **Message:** I'm being firm but still friendly.  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and offering a counter-proposal, highlighting its fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  Let's compromise again at $9250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,250 is a good price:**  It's closer to my desired price than John's offer, and the negotiation is getting close to a good outcome.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I keep rejecting offers, I risk losing Bob's interest altogether.
* **Time is running out:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to make a decision soon.

Therefore, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale that's profitable for me."
