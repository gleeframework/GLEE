Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is more than your minimum value of $12,000.
* **It's within Bob's value:** $13,000 is still below Bob's value of $12,000, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **It sets a positive tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, creating a good atmosphere for negotiation.

Remember, this is just the first offer. Be prepared to adjust based on Bob's response and be willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss. I'm also confident that I can get a better price from Bob or potentially from John. I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is unfortunately a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $11,750 is a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  The message remains friendly, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating. 
* **Highlight potential benefit:** By suggesting that both parties can walk away happy, I'm trying to appeal to Bob's desire for a mutually beneficial outcome."
