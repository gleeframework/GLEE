"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $150. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially get a better price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me.  How about $125?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price with a bit more discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $135 is within Bob's budget of $150 and a decent savings compared to John's price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's preferred price, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk of Delay:**  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but there's also a risk that the deal could fall apart or take longer, potentially leading to a loss of opportunity. 

While Bob might be able to get the price down further, accepting this offer is a good balance of saving money and securing the product within a reasonable timeframe."
