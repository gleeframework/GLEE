"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget. It's worth exploring if I can get a better price. I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go up to $950,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a significant concession from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to my desired price range, and it's still significantly lower than my maximum budget. While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  I'll accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
