"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go up to $950,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a significant concession from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,
