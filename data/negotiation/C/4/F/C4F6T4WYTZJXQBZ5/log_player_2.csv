**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation of the product, it's still $100,000 less than what John is asking. 
* **Maximizing savings:** As Bob, the goal is to save money.  Accepting Alice's offer saves $100,000 compared to buying from John."
