,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $9,800 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm offering $10,100, which is closer to your budget but still fair for the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to compromise.",10100.0,Alice,5,
