"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find anything like it elsewhere. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm very interested in the product, though.  How about $12000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $12000 is a good offer, I need to be closer to my initial price to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - how about $13500?  I'm confident this product is worth every penny, and I'm willing to work with you to find a fair price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $13500 is still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $13000?  I really want to make this deal work, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
