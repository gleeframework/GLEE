"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,225,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,225,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This represents a significant amount of money for me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
