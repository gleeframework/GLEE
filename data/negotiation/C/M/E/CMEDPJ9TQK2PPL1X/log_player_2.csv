"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $13,500, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, you know you have an alternative option with John.  There's room for negotiation here. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price and might incentivize her to come down closer to her own product valuation of $12,000."
