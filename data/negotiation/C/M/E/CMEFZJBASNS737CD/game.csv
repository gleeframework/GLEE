"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the discount, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a good price for you, considering it's worth $8,000 to you. Let's try to meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering you're willing to sell for less than $12,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my need to get a reasonable price. Let's try to close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,500 is getting closer, but I'm still only comfortable paying $9,250. This is a good price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,400, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal!",9400.0,Alice,7,
