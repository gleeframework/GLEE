"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial price of $15,000, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the discount, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to my maximum budget of $8,000. This will likely lead to further negotiation but gives me a starting point that is still appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a good price for you, considering it's worth $8,000 to you. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $10,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm going to try to get a better price in the next round. It's important to remember that I can always buy from John for $8,000, so I'm not desperate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering you're willing to sell for less than $12,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by $500 from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget.  This offer is more likely to be accepted by Alice, but still keeps me within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my need to get a reasonable price. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $9,500 is still above my budget. I believe there's still room to negotiate further, especially since I have the option of purchasing from John for $8,000.  I'll try to get Alice down a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,500 is getting closer, but I'm still only comfortable paying $9,250. This is a good price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but by a smaller amount than before. This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to pay a fair price, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. $9,250 is a good compromise, and I think it's likely that Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,400, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,400 is still above my budget of $8,000, and I've already been through several rounds of negotiation.  While I could keep bargaining, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement that works for both of us.  To avoid further delay and ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll purchase it from John for $8,000."
