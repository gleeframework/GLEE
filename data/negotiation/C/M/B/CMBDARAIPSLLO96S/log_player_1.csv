{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives you a chance to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay more. If he rejects, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your value for the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $100.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $80 is unfortunately below what I'm able to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $90?  It's still a good deal for you and closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am still unable to meet at $90. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $85 as my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my preferred price point.  I'll see if I can negotiate further to get closer to $90 before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87.50. This way, we both get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 87.5}
