"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your value for the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $80 is unfortunately below what I'm able to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $90?  It's still a good deal for you and closer to my desired price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am still unable to meet at $90. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $85 as my final offer.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87.50. This way, we both get a good deal.  What do you say?",87.5,Alice,5,
