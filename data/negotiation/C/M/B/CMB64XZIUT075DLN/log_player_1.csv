{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it is above Bob's valuation of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also provides a clear message and price for Bob to respond to. I'm confident I can make a profit of at least $130, and if Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit high for me. How about $90?  I'm serious about buying it if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm confident I can get a better price. I will counter with an offer closer to my initial price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100. If you're serious about selling, let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I'd rather continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer of $130.  I believe there's still room for compromise, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $105?  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
