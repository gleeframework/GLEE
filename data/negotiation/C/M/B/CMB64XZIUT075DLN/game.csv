"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit high for me. How about $90?  I'm serious about buying it if we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100. If you're serious about selling, let's make this happen.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $105?  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
