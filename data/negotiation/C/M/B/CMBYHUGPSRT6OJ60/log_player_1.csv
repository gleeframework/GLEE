Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but not so high as to immediately scare Bob away. I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to sell the product for $100 to John, $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to counter with a higher price to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counter-offering with $120. This is still a good distance from Bob's offer, but it's a step closer to my minimum acceptable price and might encourage him to come up a bit.  We'll see if this is a better starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I could go back and forth with him a bit more,  $100 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get any higher.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy to close the deal."
