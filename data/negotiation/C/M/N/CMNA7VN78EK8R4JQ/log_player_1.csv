Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to offer it at the price of $11,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, securing a deal with Bob for even slightly less still yields a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product to Bob at $11,000 creates a sense of urgency (limited-time offer) and potential savings for him.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $11,000, there might be a small window for negotiation with Bob if he counters. However, Alice should be prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob isn't willing to meet a price close to $11,000."
