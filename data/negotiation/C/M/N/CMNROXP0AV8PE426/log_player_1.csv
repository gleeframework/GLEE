Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, but is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. It also demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
``` 
I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm still confident that the product is worth $135. This offer is a good compromise, and I believe Bob will be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still a little below what I initially wanted, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's also higher than what John is offering.  To avoid risking losing the sale, I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
