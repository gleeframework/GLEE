Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I see in the product, but also takes into account your budget. What do you think?
