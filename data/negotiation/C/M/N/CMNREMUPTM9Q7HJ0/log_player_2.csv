Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer of $900,000. It's closer to where I need to be, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $925,000? That would allow me to move forward with the sale and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential. Let's aim for a quick agreement that benefits us both.
