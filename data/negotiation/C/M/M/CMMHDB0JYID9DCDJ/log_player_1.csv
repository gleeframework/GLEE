"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this will incentivize Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to $10,000 by continuing to negotiate. I'm confident that Bob values the product enough that he'll be willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for Bob to negotiate.  I believe this demonstrates my willingness to meet him halfway, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
