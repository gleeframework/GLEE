"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price, even if it means risking the deal falling through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Offering $9,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price. While there's always a chance Bob could negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or going through more rounds of negotiation is not worth it. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price, achieving his goal of saving money."
