Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation, allowing for a potential compromise without losing too much money.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value the product offers to Bob, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm aware of my alternative buyer (John) and have a firm minimum price in mind.  

This strategy aims to maximize my profits while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John is a better option:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, ensuring a much better outcome.
* **Room for counteroffers:**  While Bob's counteroffer is low, it does indicate that he's willing to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially squeeze out a better price.

I'm not willing to settle for Bob's current offer, but I'm open to seeing if I can negotiate a higher price.  If I don't get what I want, I have a solid backup plan with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to my minimum:** I'm making a counteroffer that's still above my minimum price of $1,200,000, but closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting value again:**  I'm reinforcing the value proposition for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit he'll get. 
* **Framing it as compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""middle ground"" to encourage Bob to see it as a reasonable solution.

By doing this, I aim to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not accepting Bob's initial offer but showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Increase the likelihood of a deal:**  My counteroffer is more likely to be accepted than a counteroffer closer to my minimum. 
* **Stay within my acceptable range:**  I'm not giving away too much value and still maintaining the potential to achieve a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but not enough:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  Further negotiation might get me closer, but it's not guaranteed.
* **John offers certainty:**  Selling to John guarantees me the full $1,200,000, providing a reliable and stable outcome.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially getting stuck in a drawn-out process.

Considering the potential for further negotiation to be unsuccessful and the guaranteed outcome with John, selling to John now is the most rational and profitable decision."
