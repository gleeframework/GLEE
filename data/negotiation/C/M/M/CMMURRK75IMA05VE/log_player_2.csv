# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to your budget, it's still over what you're willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and you can try to push for a lower price."
