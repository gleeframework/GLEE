"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
