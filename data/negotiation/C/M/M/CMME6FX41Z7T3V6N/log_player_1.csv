Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think your starting price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. While Bob is moving closer to my initial ask, I believe there's room to negotiate further and secure a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but the increments are getting smaller. Accepting at $1,275,000 secures a profit significantly above John's offer, and further haggling might not yield a much greater return. It's time to close the deal."
