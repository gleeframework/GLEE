Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but below my guaranteed sale price to John. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to nudge Bob towards considering the offer from a broader perspective than just his initial valuation. 
* **Exclusivity:**  By presenting it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" I'm subtly adding perceived value and urgency.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone remains open for further discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Important:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm secure knowing I can sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
