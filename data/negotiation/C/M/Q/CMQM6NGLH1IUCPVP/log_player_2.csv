"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $150 is far above your maximum budget of $80. John offers you a much better deal at $80, allowing you to stay within your budget."
