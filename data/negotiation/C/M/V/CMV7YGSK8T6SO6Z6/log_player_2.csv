"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always best to try and negotiate a better price.  Since Alice's offer is the maximum you're willing to pay, you have nothing to lose by trying to negotiate a lower price. You can always switch to John if you're unable to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and hopefully encourages her to come down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for improvement. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price. If she doesn't budge further, I can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate in good faith. However, I'm still aiming for a significant discount compared to Alice's initial offer. This should encourage her to meet me halfway."
