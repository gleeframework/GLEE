"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle again at $125? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",125.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with $125. I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120",115.0,Bob,6,
