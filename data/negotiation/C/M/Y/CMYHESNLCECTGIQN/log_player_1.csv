{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Setting the price at $1,300,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value Bob sees in the product while still exceeding your minimum sale price. This leaves room for negotiation but ensures a substantial profit if Bob accepts."
