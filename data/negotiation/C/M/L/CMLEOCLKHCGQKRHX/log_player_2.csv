"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the initial offer.  $14,000 is still too high for Bob, who values the product at $15,000. He has room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should start by making a bold counteroffer. He knows Alice's minimum price is $12,000, so offering $12,500 is a good starting point. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a deal, but also leaves room for negotiation if Alice is unwilling to accept immediately."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly.  While Bob still prefers to pay less, $13,500 is a good deal compared to John's price of $15,000.  There's a good chance he can negotiate a bit lower in the next round, but accepting this offer is a safe bet and gets him a good price."
