"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'd be happy to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my limits and you to still make a profit.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Let's discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise further. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,150,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but it still allows me to stay within my budget. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great opportunity to close the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
