{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate if he counters. It's also not so high that he'll immediately reject it.  I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $125 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $125 is a bit low for you, but $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is better than $125, it's still below my minimum price of $150. I'm not going to keep going back and forth with Bob.  I'll take John's offer and sell it for $150."
