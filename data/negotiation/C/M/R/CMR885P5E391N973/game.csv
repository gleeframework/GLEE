"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still constrained by my budget. Would it be possible to consider $1,110,000 as a counteroffer?
