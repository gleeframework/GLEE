"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $20000 for it. This price reflects the significant value and quality of the product. Please let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value you see in it, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $12000 for this item. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $17000, recognizing your budget constraints. This price still allows for a fair value for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still unable to meet the price of $17000 due to my budget constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $15000. I understand this may not be ideal for you, but I hope we can find a middle ground.",15000.0,Bob,4,
