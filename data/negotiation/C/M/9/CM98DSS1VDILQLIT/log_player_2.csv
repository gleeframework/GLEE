"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,400,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can try to get a better price from Alice. 
* **John's offer is a backup plan.** If you can't reach a deal with Alice, you can still buy from John, though at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see and allows for a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable.**  It's in the middle of your last offer ($1,300,000) and her previous offer ($1,400,000).
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  John's offer is $1,500,000, making Alice's current offer a better deal.
* **You can still save some money.** While you're not getting the absolute lowest price, you're still saving $150,000 compared to John's offer."
