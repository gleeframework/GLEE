"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its overall worth to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This offer reflects a fair compromise for both of us, I believe.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to compromise that much. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this is still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a price that aligns with my budget.  Would you be open to considering $775,000? I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,7,
