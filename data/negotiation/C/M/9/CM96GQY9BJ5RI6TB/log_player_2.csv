Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $105. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $95 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, $100 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $115. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $115.  You've been firm with your $100 offer. Rather than risk the price going up further in later rounds, it's best to cut your losses and buy from John for $150.  While not ideal, it's better than potentially paying more than $115 to Alice."
