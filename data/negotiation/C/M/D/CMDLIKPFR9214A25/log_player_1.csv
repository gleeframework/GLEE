"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit. I'm confident Bob will be interested given the product's value to him.  However, I'm also willing to negotiate to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $900,000 is too low. While it's more than John's offer, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly but still aiming for a good profit.  I believe this counteroffer is fair and will entice Bob to accept."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired profit, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe I can get a better price, and will counter-offer again.  There's no guarantee Bob will accept, but I'm willing to risk it for a higher profit.  I also have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm confident that this offer is still fair and will be attractive to Bob.  I'm getting closer to his offer and I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to counter-offer one more time, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. If this fails, I'll sell to John. I'm getting a bit risky here, but I want to make the most of this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm confident that this price is fair and will be appealing to Bob.  If he rejects this, I'm prepared to sell to John. I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement, but I'm not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut my losses. While Bob's offer of $990,000 is close to my desired price, I've reached the point where I'm not confident I can get a better offer. I've already passed up John's offer of $1,000,000, and with only a few rounds left, I need to be realistic. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potential disappointment. 

Selling to John guarantees me a good profit, and I'm choosing certainty over chasing a slightly higher price."
