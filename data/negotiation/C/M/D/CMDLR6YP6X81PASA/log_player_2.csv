```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is closer to his ideal price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and see if he can push for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is $15,000, which is the same price John is offering. Since Bob's goal is to save money, and both options are the same price, it's logical to choose John as he's willing to sell at the same price without requiring any further negotiation."
