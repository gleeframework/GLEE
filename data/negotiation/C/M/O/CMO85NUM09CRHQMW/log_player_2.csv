"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is $800,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than the market value to Bob, it's still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows him to purchase from John at the lower price of $800,000."
