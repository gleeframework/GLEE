"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can come to a fair price. My initial offer is $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $10,000? This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $9,625?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this a great deal.",9625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been good to work with, and I think we're close. How about we split the difference one last time and settle at $9,437.50?",9437.5,Bob,6,
