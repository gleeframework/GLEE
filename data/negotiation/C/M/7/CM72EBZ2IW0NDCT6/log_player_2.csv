"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can do better than $110. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy the product for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking to get closer to $100 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $102.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $102.50 is a better deal than $110, you can likely still do better.  You're willing to pay up to $120, but you're aiming to save as much as possible.  It's worth seeing if you can push Alice further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $102.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be ready to buy today."", ""product_price"": 100}
