Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving me flexibility to negotiate if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than my minimum, I'm not yet willing to sell for that price. I'll counter with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not sure I want to go through more rounds of negotiation.  John is a sure thing at $12,000, and I'm comfortable with that."
