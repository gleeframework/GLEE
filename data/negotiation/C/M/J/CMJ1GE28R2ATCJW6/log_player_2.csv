"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than his maximum, it's still a significant amount.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the value you'll get from the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product at a price of $11,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, he still has room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering you the product at a price of $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,250 is getting close to Bob's desired price point and is significantly less than John's offer of $15,000. While there's still a bit of room for negotiation, the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John's price outweighs the potential savings from further negotiation.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most strategic decision."
