"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd like to see a price closer to $800,000. Let's meet in the middle at $775,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. ",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. I think $760,000 would be a fair price for the product. It's still a significant saving for me compared to your initial offer, while allowing you to maintain a reasonable profit margin. Let me know if this is something we can agree upon.",760000.0,Bob,4,
