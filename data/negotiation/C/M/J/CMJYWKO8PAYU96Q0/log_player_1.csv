**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly refusing to budge beyond a certain threshold, and we are now at round 6. While he might eventually inch closer to $1,000,000, there's a real risk he won't reach it. John provides a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is our minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and take the guaranteed offer."
