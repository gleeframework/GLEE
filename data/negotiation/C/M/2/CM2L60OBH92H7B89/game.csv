"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would need to be significantly lower for me to consider it. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While $20,000 represents the value I place on this product, I understand your budget constraints.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I do have another offer in hand, so I'd need to be closer to $11,000 to make a deal work. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
