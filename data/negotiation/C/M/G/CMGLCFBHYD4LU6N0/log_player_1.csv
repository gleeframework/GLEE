Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still ensuring I get more than my minimum ($100).
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have another buyer (John) willing to pay $100. This acts as my ""walk-away"" point in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my minimum, I know he values the product at $120.  There's still room for negotiation. I'll try to nudge him a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still aiming for a price above the midpoint between our initial offers ($112.50).
* **Maintaining Value:** I don't want to drop too low too quickly and signal that I'm desperate to sell. 
* **Deadline Pressure (Optional):**  Depending on my negotiation style, I might subtly introduce a time constraint here (e.g., ""I have another offer to consider...""). This could encourage Bob to decide quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $108 is a solid profit over my minimum price ($100) and a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Bob might be getting tired of the back and forth. There's a risk he walks away, leaving me to sell to John for less.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further delays and allows me to move on to other potential sales."
