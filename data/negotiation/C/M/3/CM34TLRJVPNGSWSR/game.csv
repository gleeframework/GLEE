"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,250. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,750. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",7750.0,Bob,6,
