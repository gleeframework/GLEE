Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiating, $7,000 is too far below my minimum price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $7,500 is still too low for me, even though it's a slight improvement. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,250. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,750. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  While I'd like to get a higher price, I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are not moving quickly enough.  John is a reliable buyer, and I'm comfortable closing the deal with him."
