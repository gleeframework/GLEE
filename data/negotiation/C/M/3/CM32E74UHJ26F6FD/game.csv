"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $11,500, so I'm counteroffering $12,750. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",12750.0,Alice,5,
