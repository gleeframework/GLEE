Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $120 for it. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject it and counteroffer to try and close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $140 for the product. This seems to be a reasonable midpoint between our previous offers. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'll reject and counteroffer again to try and push for a higher price, keeping in mind I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $150 to make this work.  How about $145?  This is a fair price that's not too far off from your offer, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this out."", ""product_price"": 145}
