"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $120 for it. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $140 for the product. This seems to be a reasonable midpoint between our previous offers. I hope we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $150 to make this work.  How about $145?  This is a fair price that's not too far off from your offer, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this out.",145.0,Alice,5,
