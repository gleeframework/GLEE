Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum. How about we settle at $12,000? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice is holding firm at $12,000, which is above your maximum budget.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation. You're better off taking John's offer and saving $2,000."
