"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $1,250,000 is less than your maximum of $1,500,000.
* **You save money compared to John:** Buying from Alice saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($1,000,000), it's still a good deal for you."
