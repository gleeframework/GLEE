# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its exceptional quality and value, it's worth more than $80 to me. Considering its worth to you is $150, I propose a fair price of $120. This allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Please let me know if this offer suits you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
