"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

Since Alice's offer is the same as John's, there's no benefit to continuing to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John guarantees the product for the maximum price you're willing to pay."
