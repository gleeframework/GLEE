"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point as it's a fair distance from my minimum price of $8,000, but also leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to be aggressive in the first round to set the tone and leave space for counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I'm going to counteroffer and try to push for a better price.  I'm confident that Bob is still interested, and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm showing flexibility, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can negotiate a bit higher. I'm confident that Bob is motivated to buy, and I'm not yet ready to settle for this price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,900.  This is another compromise, moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but still aiming for a price that is more favorable to me. With only 5 rounds left, I need to start considering the possibility of accepting an offer closer to my minimum. However, I believe there is still potential for a deal at a slightly higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is very close to my minimum.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, with only 4 rounds left, it's not worth risking losing the deal altogether. I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale."
