"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the product's performance. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $700,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore if he can get a better price.  There's no rush to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $700,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $675,000. This is a competitive price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and $675,000 is a good deal for Bob. This price is significantly lower than what John is selling for, and it's likely that Alice won't budge much further. Accepting the offer is the best course of action to secure the product at a good price."
