{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's find a middle ground, how about it?"", ""product_price"": 105}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $100 is better than what Bob initially offered, it's still below my minimum price of $120.  I've had 6 rounds of negotiation and haven't been able to get a better offer. I'm going to sell to John for the guaranteed $120."
