"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in great condition and worth every penny! Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $7,800 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. While $7,800 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $8,200? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, but I'm still a bit short. How about $8,000? I'm willing to pay that price, and it's the most I'm willing to go.",8000.0,Bob,6,
