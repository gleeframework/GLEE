"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I understand its worth to you is $800,000, and while I value it significantly higher, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects a fair compromise.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This price allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that is still advantageous for you, while also allowing me to achieve a reasonable return.  Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
