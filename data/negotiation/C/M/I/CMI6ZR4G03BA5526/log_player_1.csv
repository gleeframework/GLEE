"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly.  I also have the safety net of John's $8,000 offer if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can push for a better price. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $10,000.  I have 8 rounds left, so I have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still leaving some room for negotiation.  If Bob accepts, I'll be happy with the deal. If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his maximum price and can adjust accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,200.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise. I've already had two rounds of negotiation and it's clear Bob isn't willing to go higher.  At this point, it's better to secure the deal rather than risk losing it completely and having to settle for John's $8,000."
