"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as she might be willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he wants to pay. John is offering the product at his maximum price point, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
