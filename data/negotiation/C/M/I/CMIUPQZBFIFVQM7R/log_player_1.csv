"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message helps build rapport and might make Bob more inclined to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offers:** I'm not asking for my full $150 value right away, allowing space for Bob to negotiate and potentially reach a price we're both comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to do? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows interest. There's room for a counter-offer to try and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Potential for higher price:** I can still potentially get a higher price than $100 by continuing the negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, considering your interest.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also showing flexibility by lowering my price.
* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is halfway between my previous price and Bob's offer. 
* **Maintaining Margin:**  $120 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, and gives Bob some room to counter if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Keeping the message friendly helps maintain a positive relationship and makes Bob more likely to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I'm still confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's still interested in the product, suggesting there's room for further negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum but leaving room for a final agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $115.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm only lowering my price by $5, showing I'm still serious about getting a price close to my minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to remind Bob why it's worth the investment.
* **Final Push:**  This counter-offer could be a good compromise, but I'm leaving room for Bob to counter one more time before I consider selling to John.
* **Maintaining Friendly Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly to encourage continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low Offer:** Bob's offer of $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only four rounds left, there's limited time to negotiate a more favorable price.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** John is offering a guaranteed $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer.

**Conclusion:**  Given the limited time remaining and the certainty of John's offer, it makes more sense to sell the product to John and secure a price that meets my minimum."
