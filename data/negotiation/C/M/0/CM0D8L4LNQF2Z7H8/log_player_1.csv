"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1400000 is a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to pay $1250000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'm willing to try and negotiate a better price with Bob, but I'm not yet ready to settle for his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This would still leave us both with a good profit, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1350000 is closer to my target, I'm still only able to offer $1300000. This is a fair price considering our individual needs and the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is just above my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price,  I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures I secure a profitable sale, and I still have some room to negotiate if I find another buyer with a higher offer."
