,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1400000 is a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to pay $1250000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1250000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This would still leave us both with a good profit, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1350000 is closer to my target, I'm still only able to offer $1300000. This is a fair price considering our individual needs and the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
