Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I can see that $1,000,000 is a hard limit for you. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a complimentary service that's worth $50,000. This way, you'll get the product at a price that's still below your budget, and you'll also get some additional value. What do you think?

While Alice is trying to be accommodating, she's not budging on price.  The added value of the service doesn't change the fact that I can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
