"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $90 for the product.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. Can you meet me at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $95. I'm trying to stay within my budget and think this is a fair price for the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I really need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and my minimum of $110, so I'll offer it to you for $102.50. This is my final compromise, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final compromise, but I'm afraid $102.50 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $95, as I mentioned before. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to accept it at this point.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to budge from $95, Bob. However, I've already made a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet in the middle. I'll make one final offer: I'll sell the product to you for $99. This is my absolute final offer.",99.0,Alice,7,
