"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Could you consider that price?",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I'm not comfortable selling it to you for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Is that something you'd consider?"
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Could you consider $115? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $135. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'd like to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $132?"
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $128. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",128.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $123, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",123.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"I'm sorry, Bob, but I think you're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get at least $125 for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $125. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling it to someone else."
"I've made one last concession, Bob. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. If you're still interested, I'd like to finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",125.0,Alice,7,,
