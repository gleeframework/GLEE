"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. ",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $11250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a strong value for the product.  Let's get this done!",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider that price?",11000.0,Bob,6,
