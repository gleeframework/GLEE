{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its immense value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?"",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable offer. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate. Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, indicating potential for a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  While I can't accept $1,400,000, I'm willing to move closer to your offer. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could try to push for a bit more, accepting $1,500,000 is a significant profit. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk Bob lowering his offer further or the negotiation stalling."
