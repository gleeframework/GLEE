"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $10,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I'm willing to work with you. But $9,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about $10,250? This is a fair compromise, and it brings us closer to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,
