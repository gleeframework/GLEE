{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $8,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than the minimum I need to get, but still below the value Bob places on the product. This gives Bob some room to negotiate without immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,000 as the price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is my minimum price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale."
