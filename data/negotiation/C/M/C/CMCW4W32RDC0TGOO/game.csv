"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only justify going as high as $1,000,000.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,125,000? It's a fair price considering its value to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price, but $1,125,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,062,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1062500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,062,500 is closer to what I need, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you. Let me know if you're open to this.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
