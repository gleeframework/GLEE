```tool_code
print(""Reason:Alice's first offer is too high. There's a lot of room for negotiation. I'll start by countering significantly lower to gauge her flexibility."")

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $110 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 
```tool_code
print(""Reason:This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, aiming to bring the negotiation closer to my desired price range. It's a starting point that allows for upward adjustments while staying well below my $80 limit and John's offer."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $95 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Could you do $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 
```tool_code
print(""Reason:This counter-offer splits the difference between her last offer ($95) and my previous offer ($65). It keeps the negotiation moving while staying below my $80 limit and applying pressure considering John's alternative offer."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

print(""Reason:I'm now matching John's offer. This puts the pressure on Alice, making it clear that this is my firm limit.  She can either accept it for a smaller profit or risk losing the sale altogether."") 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

```tool_code

Round 9
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Reason:Alice has come down considerably and is now only $2 above my ideal price and John's offer. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome, and continuing the back-and-forth carries the risk of Alice withdrawing from the deal. Accepting at $82 secures the product at a reasonable price."")
