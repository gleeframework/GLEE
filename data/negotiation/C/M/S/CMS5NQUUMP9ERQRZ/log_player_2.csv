"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's in your best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have multiple rounds to work with, and you can always opt to buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at your maximum price point.  It's a bold move, but it signals your seriousness about purchasing the product while firmly establishing your desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about $125? That gives us both some room to be happy. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your target price of $100. You have 7 rounds left, so there's still time to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. This is a fair price, considering the value I'm placing on the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that you're willing to negotiate but remain firm on your budget.  The $110 price point is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating your commitment to finding a solution.  This counteroffer could potentially lead to a quick agreement or a further counteroffer from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you and appreciate your efforts.  $110 is still a bit low for me, but I'm flexible. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $130 is still too high.  We are at the halfway point in the negotiation, and there's still room for compromise.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially get us closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can offer at this time. I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of our negotiation window, so it's time to make a serious counteroffer.  $115 represents a significant increase from our previous offer, demonstrating our willingness to compromise. This offer is a reasonable compromise, and it might convince Alice to accept the deal. However, if she rejects it, we still have a few rounds to negotiate or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is closer to where we need to be, but it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $122.50. This compromise allows us to both get a fair deal and close this transaction. Let's make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $122.50 is still above my maximum budget. While we are getting closer, it's becoming increasingly unlikely we'll reach a deal that meets both our needs.  With only 3 rounds remaining, the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal compared to the certainty of buying from John for $100.  Therefore, it's more advantageous to move forward with John's offer and secure the product at a known price point."
