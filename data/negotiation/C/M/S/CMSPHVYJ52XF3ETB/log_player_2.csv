"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you an amazing deal on this product, which I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great value and I'm confident you'll get a lot of use out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While you can get the product for $150 from John, Alice's offer of $120 is a better deal.  Even though it's more than the product's worth to Alice ($80), it's still within your budget of $150 and saves you $30."
