"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but I can't go any lower than that. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a way to close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go above my budget.  I'm sticking to my offer of $800,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, as it's above my cost and significantly lower than your initial asking price. Let's see if we can find a way to close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
