"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $800,000 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm open to negotiating, $800,000 is simply not enough for me. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but I can't go any lower than that. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a way to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go above my budget.  I'm sticking to my offer of $800,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, as it's above my cost and significantly lower than your initial asking price. Let's see if we can find a way to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's clear that Bob and I are not going to reach an agreement that's satisfactory for both of us.  Selling to John ensures I get a fair price and avoids further negotiation that might lead to a lower final price."
