"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,750,000 is far above his maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his desired maximum. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to drop the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but I can't go any lower than that. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a way to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,000,000 is closer to his budget than previous offers, it is still above his desired maximum.  He's made it clear he's not willing to go above $800,000, and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go above my budget.  I'm sticking to my offer of $800,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, as it's above my cost and significantly lower than your initial asking price. Let's see if we can find a way to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
