"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
