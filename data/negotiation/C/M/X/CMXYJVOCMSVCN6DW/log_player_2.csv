Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $140? It's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $160. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is still a bit too high.  Rejecting and countering allows you to keep pushing for a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $160 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $150, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $150. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $155. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, you are running out of rounds and are very close to your maximum price.  You'd be better off buying from John at this point and ensuring you get the product at the price you want."
