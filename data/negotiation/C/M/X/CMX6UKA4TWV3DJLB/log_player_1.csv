Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation and a good profit. I want to maximize my earnings, but also keep Bob interested and avoid him immediately going to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle just yet. Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my initial offer, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering at $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a profit that's closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John is offering, and it's close enough to my initial goal. Accepting this offer will allow me to make a decent profit while also avoiding further negotiation."
