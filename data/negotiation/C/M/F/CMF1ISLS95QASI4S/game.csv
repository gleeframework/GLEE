"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm looking to make a more conservative investment. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this price still reflects its potential value, but allows me to allocate my resources more efficiently.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your desire for a conservative investment,  $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit handsomely, while allowing me to secure a fair value for my asset.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still looking to make a more significant reduction in the price. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with my investment goals, and I'm willing to take on the risk to make it work.",920000.0,Bob,4,
