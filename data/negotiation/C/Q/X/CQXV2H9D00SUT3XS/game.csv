"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'm happy to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested in that price. ",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from owning this product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm at $13000. It's a fair price that benefits both of us. If you're not interested, I'm happy to go with John's offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $14500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
