"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the proposed price is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000.  Would you consider a price closer to that range?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my original offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000.  Would that be feasible?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $850,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",850000.0,Alice,5,
