You still want to save as much money as possible. While $125 is still less than John's price, you can likely get a better deal by counteroffering again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure I can go as low as $115, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $115. How about we discuss a price of $120?

Alice has come down to $120, which is the same as her initial offer. While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars by counter-offering again, it's likely that Alice will just stick to her current offer.  It's a good deal, and you're saving $30 compared to buying from John."
