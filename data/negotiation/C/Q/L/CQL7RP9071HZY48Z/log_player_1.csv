{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is higher than Bob's valuation, but still leaves room for potential compromise. It also sets a friendly tone to encourage a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me ($10,000). I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I will not accept an offer that undervalues my product. I will try to secure a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500?  This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and it's much closer to your initial offer. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is the most I've been able to get so far, and it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I would prefer to sell to John for $10,000, accepting Bob's offer is still a good outcome."
