"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500?  This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and it's much closer to your initial offer. Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Alice,3,
