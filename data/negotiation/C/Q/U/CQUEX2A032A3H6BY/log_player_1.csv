Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    *  It's significantly less than John's offer, making it attractive to Bob.
    * It earns you a $150,000 profit over your minimum acceptable price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value."
