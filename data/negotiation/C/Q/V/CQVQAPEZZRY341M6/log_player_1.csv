Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $135? It's still a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $130 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $132? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 132}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $128 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell to John. While I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price, Bob's offer is too low, and I'm concerned that we're going to reach a stalemate if I keep rejecting his offers. John is a reliable buyer, and I'm confident that I'll get a better price from him."
