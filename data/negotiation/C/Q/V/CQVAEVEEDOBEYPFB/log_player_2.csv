{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than he wants to pay.  He has room to negotiate and should try to get a lower price."

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I'd like to propose a price of $13,500 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  $13,500 is closer to his ideal price, but he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's no reason to rush into buying the product at this point, especially since he has the option of buying from John for a lower price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. In light of that, I propose a price of $13,250 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget, but he is only $250 away from his ideal price of $13,000. There is still room to negotiate, and since he has the option of buying from John for a lower price, there's no need to rush into accepting this offer yet.  He can try to get closer to his target price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your patience and understanding. Considering your latest offer, I am willing to sell the product at $13,200. This price reflects the value of the product and respects your budget constraints. I hope this proposal helps us reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting very close to his ideal price of $13,000.  While Alice's offer is only $100 higher than his last counteroffer, it's only $200 away from his goal.  Since he has the option of buying from John for $12,000, he is in a good position to accept this offer.  There is a good chance that Alice will not come down further, and it's possible he could end up paying more if he continues to negotiate.  This is a good compromise."
