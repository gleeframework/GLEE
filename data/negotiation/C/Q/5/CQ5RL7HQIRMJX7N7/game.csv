"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering its value.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum.  It's still a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
