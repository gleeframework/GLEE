"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,100,000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away happy.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still looking for a price closer to your initial offer, but I'm trying to be reasonable. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000, so I'm thinking $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
