Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than Bob's value for the product, but it gives me some room to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I can adjust the price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's still above my minimum price of $120, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get $120, Bob's offer of $115 is close enough to my minimum price and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  It's also a better deal than selling to John for $120."
