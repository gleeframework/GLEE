Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum price of $15,000 while still being potentially attractive to Bob. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so starting high allows for potential negotiation and gives me room to adjust my price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with getting only that amount.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above my minimum. It signals I'm willing to negotiate but not to give up my profit margin entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll go higher, and I'm risking further time investment for a lower payout. Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit and a better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer."
