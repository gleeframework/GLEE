Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000.  This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $8,000.  By offering a slightly higher price, I am attempting to maximize my profits while still leaving room for negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer. But if he does, I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John. This allows me to take a slightly more aggressive approach with my pricing. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  While I'm willing to settle for $8,000, there's a chance Bob might value the product even more and be willing to pay my asking price.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Even if Bob rejects my initial offer, it gives me a starting point for further negotiation. I can adjust the price based on his feedback. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. The actual negotiation process will depend on Bob's response and my assessment of his interest in the product."
