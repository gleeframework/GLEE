Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,199,000. I know it's valuable to you and I'm confident this is a fair offer that benefits us both."",
""product_price"": 1199000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's maximum gives him the perception of a deal while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer. If Bob knew you had a guaranteed buyer at a higher price, your negotiating position would weaken."
