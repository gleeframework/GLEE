Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm not quite ready to commit at that price. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What are your thoughts?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
