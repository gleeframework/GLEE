"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $70. How about we try $77? It's a great compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I'm willing to throw in some extra perks to sweeten the deal.",77.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're really close to your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $76. I'm willing to make one more compromise.
