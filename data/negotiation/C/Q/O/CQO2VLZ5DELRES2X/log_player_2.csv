"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product that I'm sure you'll find interesting. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We know there's room for negotiation, so it's better to counter-offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price seems a bit steep.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally good negotiation tactics to start with a lower offer than you're ultimately willing to pay. This gives you room to bargain upwards.
* **Significantly Below Asking:**  Offering $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's $14,000 asking price.  This might incentivize Alice to negotiate, especially since she values the product at $12,000. 
* **Walk-Away Point:**  Remember, we have a walk-away point of $15,000 (buying from John). Our goal is to get the best possible deal from Alice while staying below this limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for the product, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Room Remains:** Alice moving down to $13,000 is progress, but it's still above her own valuation of the product ($12,000) and closer to our walk-away price.
* **Strategic Counter:** By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a better deal. It might encourage Alice to come down closer to her actual valuation in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving on the price, Alice. How about we settle on $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($13,000) and our previous offer ($10,000). It shows a willingness to negotiate towards a middle ground.
* **Acceptable Price:** This price point is still within our acceptable range (below our $15,000 walk-away point) and gives us a decent saving compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's price.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** By making a reasonable counteroffer that's closer to Alice's likely valuation, we increase the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still think the product is worth more than $11,500. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Movement:** Alice's counteroffer of $13,250 is only a slight concession from her previous offer of $13,000. It suggests she might be getting more resistant to going lower.
* **Near Walk-Away:** At $13,250, the price is getting uncomfortably close to our $15,000 walk-away point.  We're losing our negotiating leverage.
* **Final Push:**  Rejecting this offer sends a strong signal that we're serious about a price closer to $12,000 or we are prepared to walk away. It's a calculated risk to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but $13,250 is really pushing my limit.  I can go up to $12,000, but that's my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  We're making it clear that $12,000 is our absolute best price. This conveys seriousness and limits further back-and-forth.
* **Justification:** We're not just stating a number; we're explaining that this is our limit and hinting at alternatives (John's offer) without explicitly threatening to walk away.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $12,000, we match Alice's own valuation of the product.  She's now incentivized to sell to us at this price, as it's the best she can realistically get."
