I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product that I'm sure you'll find interesting. Would you like to make an offer on it?,14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price seems a bit steep.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for the product, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving on the price, Alice. How about we settle on $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still think the product is worth more than $11,500. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but $13,250 is really pushing my limit.  I can go up to $12,000, but that's my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
