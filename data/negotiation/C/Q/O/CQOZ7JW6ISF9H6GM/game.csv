"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $825,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value you've mentioned and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Bob,4,
