You should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is more than your target of $800,000. You have a better option to buy from John for $800,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.

While $850,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you might be able to secure a better price.  You have the option of buying from John for $800,000, so you're not in a rush to accept Alice's offer."
