Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other interested parties. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below John's price creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, which could still be very profitable for Alice.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the ""exclusive"" nature of the offer to make it more appealing. 
 
This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value while still leaving Alice with a substantial profit."
