"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is lower than your maximum budget ($150), you can likely get a better deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a lower price. She might come back with a counteroffer closer to her $120 value.  If not, you can always buy from John for $150, ensuring you get the product."
