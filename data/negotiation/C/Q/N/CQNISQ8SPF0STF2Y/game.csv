"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to me, at least $1500000. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 seems a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1600000 is a good offer, it's a bit below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's find a mutually agreeable price.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1600000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Can you meet me in the middle at $1700000?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
