Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the effort, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,200, which is $8,600. However, I'm not willing to go any lower. How about we stick with my previous offer of $9,200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has made it clear she won't go below $9,200.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk she'll hold firm or even raise her price.  It's better to accept the $9,200 offer now, saving $2,800 compared to John's price."
