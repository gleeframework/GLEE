"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual budget. This gives me room to negotiate upwards and hopefully still secure a price well below $800,000.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This first counteroffer will give me insight into how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to walk away and buy from John for $800,000. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $900,000 is closer to the mark, but I'm still aiming for something a bit more manageable.  Would you consider $700,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** I'm increasing my offer, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not jumping too high too quickly. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $700,000 puts me in a good position. It's a significant increase from my last offer and is getting close to my walk-away point of $800,000.
* **Time Consideration:**  We're getting closer to the 10-round limit. I need to start nudging Alice towards a price I'm comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $700,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Limit:** Alice's offer of $850,000 is above my maximum budget of $800,000.
* **Better Alternative:** John is offering the same product for $800,000, which is a better deal than Alice's current offer.
* **No Guarantee of Further Negotiation:** There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further in price, even with more rounds of negotiation. 

It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal from John."
