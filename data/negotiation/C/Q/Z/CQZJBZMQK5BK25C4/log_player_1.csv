"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Confidence:** My message conveys confidence in the value of the product for Bob, which might encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts, demonstrating flexibility.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as an alternative buyer allows me to walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go my way.
* **10 Rounds:**  I have enough rounds to explore different price points and strategies.
* **Bob's Value:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, I'm aiming for a price somewhere between that and my minimum, hoping to find a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:** Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and far less than the product's worth to me. Accepting this would be a huge loss.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I have 10 rounds and John as a backup.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and try to reach a more favorable price.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, but still below my original offer, showing flexibility while protecting my interests.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Potential for Compromise:**  While Bob's initial offer was unacceptable, there's still a chance we can find a middle ground.
* **Time is on my Side:** With 10 rounds, I can afford to be patient and see if Bob is willing to come up in price.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is tempting, I believe there's still a strong chance of getting a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from the initial $1,200,000, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this price would be beneficial for both of us.  It's higher than Bob's offer, but still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Finding the Middle Ground:**  My goal is to find a price that bridges the gap between my minimum and Bob's offer. 
* **Negotiation Process:** This counteroffer shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but I'm not willing to give away the product for a loss.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm still prepared to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $900,000 is closer to the mark, but I'm still aiming for something a bit more manageable.  Would you consider $700,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting this would mean a significant financial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I have more rounds left and John as an alternative buyer. This gives me leverage to continue the negotiation and hopefully reach a better price.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to $900,000, showing flexibility while still safeguarding my interests.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  My goal is to find a price that's mutually beneficial and closer to my minimum.
* **Time is on my Side:** With 8 rounds remaining, I can afford to be patient and see if Bob is willing to increase his offer.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I'm confident I can get a better price with Bob if I continue the negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $700,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $700,000. This shows willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum price.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price for both parties, making it sound like a win-win situation.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language like ""happy to work with you"" and ""fair price"" to maintain a friendly tone and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:** This offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal, while still ensuring I get a price that is close to my target.
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, I'm increasing the pressure to find a solution.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is always a safety net, I believe there's still potential to get a higher price from Bob."
