"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11000? I believe this would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12500. This is a fair price that I think we can both be happy with. Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit outside of my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $11750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product. Let me know what you think.",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I'm still a bit above $11750. How about we meet at $13000? This is a price that I'm comfortable with, and it's still a good deal for you. Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $12250. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and it would still allow me to stay within my budget.  I think this is a good compromise.",12250.0,Bob,6,
