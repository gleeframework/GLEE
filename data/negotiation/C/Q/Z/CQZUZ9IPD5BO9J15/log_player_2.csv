"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $12,000 is above your maximum price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have room to negotiate with Alice since she values the product at $10,000, leaving a potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.

By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're willing to negotiate and potentially get a better price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12500. This is a fair price that I think we can both be happy with. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $12,500 is above your maximum price of $15,000, and you're still aiming for a lower price. 
* **There's still room for negotiation:** Alice lowered her price from $12,000, showing a willingness to compromise.  You can likely get a lower price with another counteroffer.

By rejecting the offer again, you continue the negotiation process and try to reach a more agreeable price."
