Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know the product's value to Bob is $1,500,000 and we want to maximize profit, starting with a higher price ($2,000,000) creates room for negotiation.
* **Sense of urgency and exclusivity:**  The message implies there are other potential buyers, which could motivate Bob to act quickly and potentially meet the asking price. 
* **Fallback option:**  We have the security of selling to John for $1,500,000 if Bob rejects the offer, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy.  In a more dynamic scenario, adjusting the price based on Bob's response would be ideal."
