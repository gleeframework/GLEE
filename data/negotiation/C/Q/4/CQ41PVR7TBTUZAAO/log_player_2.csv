"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for this product, which is still a fair price given its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This offer takes into account your budget constraints while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's budget, but closer to his maximum.  However, Bob can still try to negotiate further to see if he can get a better price. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's getting closer, the negotiation process seems to be getting slower.  Bob has already gone through several rounds and is nearing his budget limit.  Given that John offers the product for $1,200,000, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
