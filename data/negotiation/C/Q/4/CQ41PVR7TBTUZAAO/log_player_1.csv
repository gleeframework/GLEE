Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for this product, which is still a fair price given its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This offer takes into account your budget constraints while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of achieving a better deal. I'm not yet ready to sell to John as I believe there's still potential for a more favorable outcome with Bob."
