Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so he's likely to consider this offer.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $150, so you have room to negotiate. 
* **It shows you're willing to be flexible:** Starting with a slightly lower offer than your minimum shows Bob that you're open to finding a mutually beneficial price. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I am willing to negotiate, I will not sell below my minimum. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm open to negotiation, $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** It acknowledges Bob's offer and attempts to find a middle ground.
* **Maintains a profitable margin:** $120 is still above your minimum price of $150.
* **Positions you for potential acceptance:** This offer might be appealing enough for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to risk selling it for such a low price.  John has already offered me $150, which is my minimum, so I'm going to sell the product to John."
