"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a special introductory price of $140 for you. This is a fantastic opportunity to experience the benefits of our product at a discounted rate compared to its usual value of $150. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Please let me know if you're interested or if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting and slightly below your maximum budget, you know you have John as a backup option at $150.  There's a chance you could get a better deal from Alice if you reject her initial offer."
