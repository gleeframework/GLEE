Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed offer. There's no benefit to further negotiation with Bob, as you risk him lowering his offer or the negotiation failing altogether. Selling to John ensures you get your minimum acceptable price."
