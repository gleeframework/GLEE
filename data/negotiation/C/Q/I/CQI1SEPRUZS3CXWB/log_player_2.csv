It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $85 is a good price, but there's potential to get it even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $70. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see if she's willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80

``` 
$80 is a fair price, and I'm happy to accept it.  I'm not sure if I can get a better deal with Alice, and I don't want to risk losing the product to John."
