"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, but Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for your product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, but still within the realm of reason. He's showing Alice he's serious about buying, but also wants a good deal.
* **Value Argument:** Bob emphasizes the value to *him*, suggesting he's aware of the product's worth to Alice but is focused on his own needs.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, suggesting a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While she's shown a willingness to negotiate, it's not enough for Bob to accept.
* **Further Negotiation:**  There's still room for Bob to get a better deal by making another counteroffer.  
* **The Alternative:**  Bob can always buy from John, which is a better deal than accepting Alice's current offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Respectful:** Bob is standing his ground but maintains a respectful tone.  He's demonstrating he's serious about his price and won't budge significantly.
* **Value Argument Again:**  Bob reiterates the ""value to both of us"" angle, subtly reminding Alice that a deal at this price benefits them both.
* **Closing the Gap:**  He's not moving drastically, but he's showing a willingness to continue the conversation.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Time Pressure:** With limited rounds, Bob needs to find a balance between being firm and allowing for negotiation.
* **Alice's Motivation:**  If Alice is eager to sell, she might be more likely to accept a counteroffer closer to Bob's target price."
