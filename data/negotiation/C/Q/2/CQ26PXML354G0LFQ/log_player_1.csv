"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130. It's worth at least that much to me, but I'm willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $130 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum of $120.  I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $115?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you can't go as low as I initially offered, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While $107 is closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little more. I'm not willing to sell for less than $120, but I'm open to negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I think $110 is a fair compromise. It's closer to what you want, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $109 seems like a fair price that acknowledges both of our positions. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's only $1 less than my last offer, and we've been going back and forth for a few rounds. I'm starting to feel like this is as good as it's going to get.  Plus, it's important to avoid over-negotiating and potentially jeopardizing the deal altogether."
