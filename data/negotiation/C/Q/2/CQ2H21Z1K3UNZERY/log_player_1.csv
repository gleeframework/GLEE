Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in your offer.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too far from what I need to make this deal work for me.

Let's see if we can finalize this deal in the next round."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
