Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring Alice makes a significant profit.
* **Above Minimum:** The offer is well above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($10,000), guaranteeing a good profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 

**Why not ask for the full $12,000?**

While Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000, starting at that price might make Bob feel like there's no room for negotiation and could lead to an immediate rejection."
