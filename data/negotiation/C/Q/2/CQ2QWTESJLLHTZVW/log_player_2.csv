"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product, and Alice is offering it for $120. While this is a good price, you can potentially get it for even less by counteroffering. There's no reason to buy immediately when you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** You want to pay as little as possible, ideally closer to Alice's value of $100.
* **Compromise:** A counteroffer of $105 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $120, showing your intent to negotiate seriously.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While a lower offer might be tempting, $105 provides a good chance of Alice accepting while still saving you a decent amount.

**Note:**  The negotiation strategy could be adjusted based on your risk tolerance and the perceived value of the product to you. If the product is very important, you might be willing to offer a bit more to secure it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counteroffer:**  Alice increased her offer to $125, which is closer to your initial target price.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While you could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk of Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further, especially since she already rejected your offer.
* **Value vs. Risk:** The $125 price is still within your budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  The risk of further negotiation might not be worth the potential reward. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice, considering the balance between the potential for further negotiation and the risk of losing a good deal."
