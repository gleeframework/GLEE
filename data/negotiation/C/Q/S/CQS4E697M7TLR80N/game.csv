"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  While $12,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me there?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500, but I can try to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $11,500. How about $12,000? I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",12000.0,Alice,5,
