Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows me to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $5 less than what John is offering.  It's not worth risking further negotiation for a small gain.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a better price than John's offer."
