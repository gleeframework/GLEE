"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is closer to my desired amount and it's getting risky to continue the negotiation.  Selling to John for $150 is a safe option, but Bob's offer is good enough that I'll accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
