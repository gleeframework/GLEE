"I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle at $150?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I can't go as low as $120, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $160? It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $145, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at $145?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $145 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $150. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the sale.",150.0,Alice,5,
