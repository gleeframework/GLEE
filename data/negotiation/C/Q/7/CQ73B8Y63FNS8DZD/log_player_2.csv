"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so it's likely she's trying to make a profit. Her offer of $950,000 is too high, and I can get it from John for $1,500,000, which is still within my budget of $1,500,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John.
