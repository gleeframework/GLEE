"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that recognizes its value while still being a good deal for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
