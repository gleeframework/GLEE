"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really value. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $90.  This is a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $90 is less than the $100 you're willing to pay from John. 
* Accepting the offer means you save $10 compared to buying from John."
