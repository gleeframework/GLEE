"I have a unique opportunity to sell you a high-end product that I think you'll really love. I'm looking to get a fair price for it, so I'm starting with an offer of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your asking price. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll meet you at $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great price for you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
