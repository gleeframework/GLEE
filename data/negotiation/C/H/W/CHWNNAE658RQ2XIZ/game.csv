"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,500 to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $9,250. I'm getting close to my budget, and I really like the product. Can you consider this offer?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,400 to finalize this deal. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $9,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9200.0,Bob,6,
