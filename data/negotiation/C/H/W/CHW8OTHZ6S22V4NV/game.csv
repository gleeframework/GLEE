"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $1000000 doesn't come close to reflecting the true worth of this product. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on $1250000? It's a fair price that acknowledges your interest and my investment.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
