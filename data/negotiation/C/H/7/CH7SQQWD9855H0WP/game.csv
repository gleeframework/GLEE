"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy the product for $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to you and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down a little more.  How about $10,250? This still leaves a good profit margin for you, and it's closer to the value I see in the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $10,250 is a bit higher than my initial counteroffer, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on it and the fact that I'm willing to pay a premium. Let me know what you think!",9800.0,Bob,4,
