Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start with a strong position. Offering it for $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though you know it's worth less to Bob objectively.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By positioning the price closer to your minimum acceptable price than Bob's perceived value, you anchor the negotiation in your favor. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have some wiggle room but remember, your goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring the sale."
