,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to offer you $85.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $85. How about we try $102.50?",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $102.50 is still a bit high for me. How about $90? That's a fair compromise, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $97.50? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",97.5,Alice,5,
