,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This still gives you a good deal considering the value to you. Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $100?  That way we both get a fair deal, and I don't have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to pay $100. I'm willing to meet you at $97.50, which is still a good deal for both of us.",97.5,Bob,6,
