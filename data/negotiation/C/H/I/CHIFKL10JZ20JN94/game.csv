"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but it has to be at a price that makes sense for both of us.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my original asking price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle again, at $12,500? That's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,500. This is the lowest I can offer, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am ready to buy if we can land on the right number.  Would you consider $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $13,250. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finally find a price that works for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,7,
