{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $12,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. This should encourage Alice to negotiate further."

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what I'd ideally like to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially get a lower price."
