Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation.  It's likely Bob will counteroffer, and I'll be able to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my preferred price point.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $10,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.  It also leaves room for a final counteroffer if necessary, before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has now offered my desired price of $9,500. It would be foolish to reject this and risk having to sell to John for a lower price. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
