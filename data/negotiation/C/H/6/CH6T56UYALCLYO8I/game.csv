"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $800,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing us to both get a good deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $825,000. I think this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",825000.0,Alice,5,
