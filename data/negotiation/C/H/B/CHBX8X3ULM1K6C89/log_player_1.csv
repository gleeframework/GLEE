Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $95, you aim to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($20) between your minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value.  

This leaves room for negotiation (Bob could counter-offer) while still ensuring you make a profit significantly higher than selling to your backup buyer, John."
