"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its market value is significantly higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but $12000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings and the discount I'm offering. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and what other sellers are offering. I believe we can reach an agreement if we both show a bit of flexibility.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11500. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer the product to you for $11250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11250 is getting closer to my target price. However, I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $10750 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer the product to you for $11000, but I'll throw in a premium service package that's worth $500. This will bring the total value to $11500. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate the offer of the service package, it's not something I'm looking for at this time.  I'm happy to stick with my previous offer of $10750 for the product itself.  This price is fair and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement and close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll offer the product to you for $10900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10900.0,Alice,9,
