Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I believe its value to you justifies a starting price of $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for this product. This reflects its value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and there's still potential to secure a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  To demonstrate my willingness to find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This represents a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This offer reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both be happy with. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While it's closer than his previous offer, I have 6 more rounds to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. I'm not in a rush to settle for anything less than my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth to both of us.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal with this offer."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your ongoing efforts to find a solution, but $1300000 is still a bit high. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to go up to $1275000.  This offer is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's finalize this agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $1,275,000 is still below my minimum of $1,000,000. I have 4 more rounds to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. I'm not in a rush to settle for anything less than my minimum, especially since I can still sell to John for $1,000,000 if needed."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While it seems like we are close to an agreement, with only 2 rounds left, the risk of not getting my minimum is too high. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk ending up with less."
