"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I believe its value to you justifies a starting price of $1400000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's value to you ($1,500,000).

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. This reflects its value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your commitment to negotiating.

* **Focus on value:** The message emphasizes the value to you, making it clear you're not just throwing out a random number."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. While I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me.  To demonstrate my willingness to find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This represents a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Room for further negotiation:** You have 7 rounds left, giving you ample time to try and get a better price. 
* **John is a backup:**  If you can't get a better price from Alice, you can still buy from John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
