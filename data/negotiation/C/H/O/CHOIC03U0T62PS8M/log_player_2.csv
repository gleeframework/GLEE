# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I believe it will bring significant value to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to see if a better price can be achieved. There's potential to save a significant amount of money by counteroffering."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than 750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for 825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.
