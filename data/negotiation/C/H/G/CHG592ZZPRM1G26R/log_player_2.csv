Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that the price is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see that you're close to the price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge much further on price. Taking the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000 makes more sense than risking further counter-offers that could still end up above that."
