"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price of $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that the price is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I can see that you're close to the price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
