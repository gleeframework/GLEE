Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the ""win-win"" aspect of the deal.
* **Flexibility:** This offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately triggering a sale to John. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or sell to John. 
* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale that's significantly better than my floor price of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my floor price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly lower than my ideal outcome.
* **Potential for Improvement:** I believe there's room for further negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially secure a price closer to my target.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but it's also a lower price than I'm aiming for.  

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $900,000 and $1,000,000.  I'll continue to negotiate until I'm satisfied with the price or decide to sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a fair price, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer and a fair value for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate that the offer represents a significant discount from my original price, highlighting the value proposition for Bob.
* **Urgency:** The message uses a slightly more assertive tone, suggesting a desire to finalize the deal promptly. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've achieved a sale that's close to my desired price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to reassess my options. If his counteroffer is significantly lower, selling to John might become more attractive. However, I'll continue to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $920000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my desired outcome, especially considering my floor price of $1,200,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Negotiating further might lead to a lower price or a longer negotiation process, potentially jeopardizing the sale altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  Accepting Bob's offer secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point. It minimizes risk and allows me to close the deal quickly and efficiently."
