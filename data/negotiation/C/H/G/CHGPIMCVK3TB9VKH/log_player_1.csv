Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $12,000? This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 12000}

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can close the deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our back and forth, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500? This feels like a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not yet willing to settle. I believe there's still room for negotiation."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob and I are not likely to find a mutually agreeable price. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $10,000.  Although it's not my ideal price, it's still within my minimum acceptable range and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
