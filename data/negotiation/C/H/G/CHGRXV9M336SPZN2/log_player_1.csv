Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** $140 is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value ($120) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** It's important to start with a price that allows for some wiggle room. This gives Bob the feeling that he can get a better deal and encourages him to engage in the negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:** The fact that John is willing to pay $150 provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John and guarantee a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is within my minimum value:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $130 is still above my minimum threshold of $150. 
* **Avoiding the risk of a counteroffer:** I don't want to risk a counteroffer from Bob that could be lower, potentially pushing me further below my desired price point.
* **Time and Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a higher offer. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and certain sale, minimizing potential delays and uncertainties."
