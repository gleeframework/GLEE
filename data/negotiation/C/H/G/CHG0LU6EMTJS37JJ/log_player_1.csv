{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the unique product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $15000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price just yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $17,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the market value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $16000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it.  It's better than selling to John, and it seems like we're both happy with this compromise."
