"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $800000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering the product's value to me, I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly unique.",850000.0,Alice,3,
