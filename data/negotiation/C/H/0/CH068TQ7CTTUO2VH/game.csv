"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives us both a good deal, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $9,750 is getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $10,000, which is a fair price for both of us. If you're serious about buying the product, I think this is our best chance to make a deal. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,5,
