"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that might be even more attractive. I'm asking for $950000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential. Please let me know your thoughts. ",950000.0,Alice,1,
