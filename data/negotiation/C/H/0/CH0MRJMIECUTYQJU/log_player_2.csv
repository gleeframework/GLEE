"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with an offer of $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her perceived value, it's still higher than your maximum budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It signals that you are serious about buying the product, but also that you are willing to walk away if the price doesn't meet your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1150000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is within my budget, and it's closer to my desired price than John's offer of $1,200,000. While I could continue negotiating, accepting this offer minimizes risk and potentially saves time."
