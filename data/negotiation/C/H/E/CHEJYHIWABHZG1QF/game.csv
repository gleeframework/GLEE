"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $8,750? That's a fair compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I can do $9,200, which is the absolute lowest I can go. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,950? That's a fair deal for both of us.",8950.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,200. I'm already losing money at this point. If you're not willing to meet me at $9,200, I think it's best for me to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's not worth my while to continue negotiating at this point.",9200.0,Alice,7,
