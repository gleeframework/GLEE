"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in working with me at that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? It's still a good deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12500. This would be a fair price for both of us, as I'm saving money and you're getting a good deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
