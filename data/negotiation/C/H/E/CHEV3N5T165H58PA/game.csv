"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $9000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go. I'm willing to come down a little further and offer you the product for $9500. This would be a great deal for you, as you'd still be getting the product for less than you initially estimated its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,3,
