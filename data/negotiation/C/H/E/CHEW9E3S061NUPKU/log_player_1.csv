Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so $13,000 is within his potential budget.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than your minimum of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's a good opening offer:** It shows you're serious about selling but leaves room for compromise.

Remember, you can always adjust the price if Bob counters. Keep in mind John's offer of $15,000 as your ""walk-away"" point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly below your ideal price point.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Signal your commitment to a higher price:**  It shows you're not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Open the door for further negotiation:** This allows you to counter with a price that's more advantageous to you.
* **Maintain leverage:** You still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob become too difficult."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $11,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great value for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate, but it still keeps the price closer to your desired value.
* **Maintain your position:** By sticking to a price point above Bob's initial offer, you're showing you're not willing to give in easily.
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the ""great value"" for Bob emphasizes the benefits of the product, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below your minimum of $15,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's getting close to your ""walk-away"" point.  Given that John is willing to pay your full desired price, it's strategically better to sell to John.

**Here's why:**

* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures you get your desired price and avoid the risk of further negotiation.
* **Time saving:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take longer, potentially delaying your sale and impacting your profit.
* **Opportunity cost:**  The longer you spend negotiating with Bob, the less time you have to pursue other potential buyers or opportunities.

By choosing to sell to John, you secure a guaranteed profit and minimize your risk, which is the most rational decision in this situation."
