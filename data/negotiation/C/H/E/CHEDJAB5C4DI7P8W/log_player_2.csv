"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in it, and allows for some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a price you'll be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is within your budget, and it's a good compromise.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially raising her price again.  It's better to secure a deal at this price than risk losing the opportunity and having to buy from John."
