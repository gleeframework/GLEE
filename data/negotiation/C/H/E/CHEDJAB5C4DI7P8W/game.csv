"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in it, and allows for some room for negotiation.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a price you'll be happy with.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
