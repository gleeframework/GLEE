Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  The product is definitely interesting, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower than $950,000.  Would you be willing to consider $850,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your valuation of $800,000.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
