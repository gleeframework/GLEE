"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  The product is definitely interesting, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower than $950,000.  Would you be willing to consider $850,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your valuation of $800,000. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my original valuation of $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
