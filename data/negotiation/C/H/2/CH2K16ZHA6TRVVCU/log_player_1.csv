I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a comfortable margin above my minimum price of $120. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

While I'm happy to sell the product for $120,  I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price."
