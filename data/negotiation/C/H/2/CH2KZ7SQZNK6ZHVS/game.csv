"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable meeting you at $1200000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. My counteroffer is $1350000. This is the highest I'm willing to go for now.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still very interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1150000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. My counteroffer is $1250000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're being cautious with your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far away from my target price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1200000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price. I'm going to make a final offer: $1200000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. This is my last offer.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
