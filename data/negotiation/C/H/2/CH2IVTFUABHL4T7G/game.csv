"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm happy to start the negotiations at $20,000. I believe this is a fair price reflecting its worth.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $11,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle - how about $17,000? This reflects the quality and benefits you'll be receiving.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However,  $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I feel that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I understand your perspective on the value, but I need to be closer to the actual worth of this product. How about we settle on $15,500? This is my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your understanding. While $15,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my absolute limit. I'd be willing to stretch to $13,000. Let me know if that works for you - otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
