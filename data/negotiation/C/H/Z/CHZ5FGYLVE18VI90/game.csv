"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product, recognizing its value and the potential benefit it could bring to my business. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value you've proposed, $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. To bridge the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the significant worth of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Given the product's value and the benefits it would bring to my business, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can finalize this agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
