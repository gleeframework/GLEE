"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer because I can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, which is $300,000 more than Alice's offer. I want to save as much money as I can.
