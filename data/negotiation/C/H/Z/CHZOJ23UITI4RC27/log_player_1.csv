Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations above your target price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still securing a price well above your minimum. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer is intentionally ambitious. It allows you to see how serious Bob is and how he values the product. His response will give you valuable information for the next stage of negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer. This strong alternative allows you to negotiate confidently with Bob, knowing you have a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I am willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's maximum valuation of the product is $1,200,000, meaning he might be willing to go a little higher than his current offer. Rejecting his offer now keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, the product's true worth is reflected in its potential to significantly benefit your business. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,750,000?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This approach often feels fair to both parties. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's benefits to Bob, reminding him of the potential return on his investment.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation active and leaves room for further adjustments if needed, depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my financial situation, I am unable to agree to $1,750,000. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $1,400,000.  His offer is now significantly below John's guaranteed offer.
* **Time Cost of Negotiation:**  Further negotiation rounds with Bob might only yield small increases, while you have a guaranteed offer in hand. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** By continuing to negotiate with Bob, you risk losing the opportunity to sell to John, especially if other potential buyers emerge. 

It's more profitable and efficient to accept John's offer at this point."
