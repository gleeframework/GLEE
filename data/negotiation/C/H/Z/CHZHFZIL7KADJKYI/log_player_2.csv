"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, Alice's message hints that she's willing to negotiate (she emphasizes the ""deal""). By rejecting this offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer from Alice at a lower price, getting you closer to her $8,000 valuation."
