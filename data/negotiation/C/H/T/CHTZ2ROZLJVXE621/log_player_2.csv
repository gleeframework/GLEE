"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000, considering its unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far above his maximum budget, and he can get the product from John for significantly less."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value this product highly, I understand your budget constraints. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $15,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $10,000. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice, but he shouldn't overpay."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm firm on my offer of $10,000. If you're not able to come down to that, I'll need to move forward with another seller. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
