,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get from the product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and it ensures we both get a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. Can we consider this a reasonable price for both of us?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,325,000. I'm still a bit firm on my last offer, but I'm willing to go down to $1,340,000. This is a very fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's try to close this deal.",1340000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting close. I'm willing to come down to $1,330,000.  This is my final offer.  I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1330000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,330,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,290,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1290000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,290,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,310,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in this deal. Let's close this now.",1310000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've gone as low as I can, and I'm still not comfortable with $1,310,000. I'm afraid I'll have to pass on this deal and explore other options. I appreciate your time and effort, but I think I'll have to look elsewhere for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,10,
