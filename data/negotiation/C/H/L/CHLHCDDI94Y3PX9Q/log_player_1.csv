"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to Bob's value of $120 without pushing him away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That way we both get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's last offer. This way, I can demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate while still keeping a higher profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price of $100, Bob's offer of $90 is a fair compromise and a good deal for me. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit above my minimum without risking further negotiations."
