"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I could consider a price of $875,000. This offer reflects the product's value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While $750,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $825,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
