"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special offer considering its value to you is $12,000. I believe this price reflects both the quality of the product and your perceived need for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  Alice is offering the product for $14,000, which is more than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. While Alice claims the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, that's not a reliable indicator of its true value to Bob. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I would like to counter with an offer of $13,500. This price aims to bridge the gap between our initial offers and provides a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

Bob should buy from John.  While $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum price.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, it's the most financially sensible option for Bob."
