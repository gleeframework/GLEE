"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this sale happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly motivated to sell as her offer is significantly higher than the product's value to her ($12,000 vs. $8,000). 
* While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price.
* You have a backup option with John at $15,000, so there's less risk in rejecting Alice's initial offer.

**Strategy:** Aim to negotiate a price closer to $10,000. Alice might be willing to go lower to avoid losing the sale."
