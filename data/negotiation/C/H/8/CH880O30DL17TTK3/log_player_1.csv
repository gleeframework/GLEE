"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this amazing product at a price that reflects its value.  I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. My offer is $1,750,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  A positive tone helps build rapport and sets a cooperative tone.
* **Value emphasis:**  I highlight the product's value to Bob to justify the price. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  The price is still significantly lower than my minimum, allowing for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is willing to compromise, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I have 8 rounds left, and there's room for me to counter and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but I might be able to get more from Bob with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this valuable product.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price still reflects the product's true value, and it allows us to find a solution that benefits both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower price:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price, reminding Bob of its worth. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I frame the price as a win-win scenario, highlighting how it benefits both of us.
* **Open for discussion:** I end with an open question to encourage Bob to respond and continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I have 6 rounds left, and there's still room for me to counter and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but I'm closer to getting a better deal with Bob. There's a chance that Bob might be willing to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it still doesn't quite reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and drop my price to $1,550,000. This offer is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet halfway:** I'm offering a price that's in the middle of our current positions, demonstrating a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintain firm stance:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving away too much, ensuring I still get a good price.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I present the offer as a fair compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Encourage closure:** I explicitly invite Bob to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We are in round 6, with only 4 rounds left. The negotiation is getting close to the end.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** Bob's offer is only $100,000 away from my minimum acceptable price. Further negotiation may not result in a significantly better offer.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $1,500,000, which is more than Bob's current offer.
* **Risk assessment:**  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer and potentially running out of time before reaching a satisfactory price.

I'm choosing to sell the product to John to ensure a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob."
