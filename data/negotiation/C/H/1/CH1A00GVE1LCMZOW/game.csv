"Alice, your offer is too high. I'm only willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let's make this happen!",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 simply isn't enough.  This product holds significant value for me, and I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $1150000?  This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing you to get a valuable product and me to secure a reasonable return. Let's find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still too high.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price is a significant compromise from my previous offer and reflects the value of the product to you. It's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's close this deal now!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975000.  This is a very fair price that will allow us both to get a good deal. Let's reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975000 just doesn't work for me. This product is worth more than that, and I need to ensure I get a fair return. Let's split the difference: $1012500. It's a reasonable compromise that allows us to both walk away satisfied. This is my final offer. ",1012500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair return, but $1012500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $990000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's the highest I can go. Let's close this deal now. ",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise.  $990000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is my very final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.  Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,9,
