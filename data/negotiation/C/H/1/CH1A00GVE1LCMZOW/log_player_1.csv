Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting high sets a strong initial expectation. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, I've justified it by highlighting the value to Bob.
* **Optimistic Approach:** I'm aiming for the highest possible price, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest. 

This is a bold opening move.  We'll see how Bob reacts and adjust accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is too high. I'm only willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Bob's rejection opens the door for counter-offers.  
* **Potential for compromise:** I believe there's room for a more mutually beneficial price.  

I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 simply isn't enough.  This product holds significant value for me, and I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing you to get a valuable product and me to secure a reasonable return. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but also a considerable reduction from my initial price. 
* **Middle Ground:** Aiming for a middle ground shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both parties.
* **Justification:** I reiterate the value of the product to emphasize why I can't accept a lower price. 
* **Call to Action:**  I encourage Bob to meet me halfway, highlighting the potential for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still too high.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation continues:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe we can reach a more favorable price.
* **Risk of selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I'm still hoping to maximize my profit.  

I'm not willing to settle for $950,000 just yet. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

Let's close this deal now!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight compromise:**  I'm reducing my offer by $100,000, showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob, reinforcing the rationale behind the price.
* **Urgency:** I'm urging Bob to close the deal, suggesting a win-win situation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975000.  This is a very fair price that will allow us both to get a good deal. Let's reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still under my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation space:**  While we're getting closer, there's still room for further negotiation. I'm confident we can reach a price that's more advantageous for me.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, but I'm still hopeful that a better price is possible with Bob.  I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation.

I'm pushing for a higher price, but I'm also aware that I'm running out of rounds. I'll need to be strategic in my next counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This message clearly signals that I'm nearing the end of my negotiation.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a fair return, but $1012500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $990000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's the highest I can go. Let's close this deal now.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise.  $990,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000.
