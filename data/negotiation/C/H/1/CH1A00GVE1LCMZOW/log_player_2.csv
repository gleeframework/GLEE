# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 simply isn't enough.  This product holds significant value for me, and I'm willing to negotiate further.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price is a significant compromise from my previous offer and reflects the value of the product to you. It's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's close this deal now!

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975000 just doesn't work for me. This product is worth more than that, and I need to ensure I get a fair return. Let's split the difference: $1012500. It's a reasonable compromise that allows us to both walk away satisfied. This is my final offer.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
