{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, giving me room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm also framing it as a potential benefit for Bob, making it more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better.  There's a chance he's willing to pay more, so I'll try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  This would still give us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it seems like he's not willing to go any higher. It's better to accept his offer now than risk him walking away or me needing to lower my price further."
