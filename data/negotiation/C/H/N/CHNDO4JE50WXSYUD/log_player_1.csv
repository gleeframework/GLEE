"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000. This is a significant amount less than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. This also leaves me some room to counter if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is a decent price, I'm still holding out for more. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It allows for further negotiation while still leaving me a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is close to my desired price and I'm running out of rounds. It's time to close the deal and secure a good profit."
