"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a significant discount for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $15000, I can offer you a compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit while also providing you with a good deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $14000 as a more reasonable price. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering your previous offer of $12000 and your latest offer of $14000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'll sell the product to you for $16000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,
