Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's valuation, but still below your minimum. It gives Bob a slight incentive to negotiate and keeps the door open for a counteroffer. If he rejects, you can always adjust your offer or go to John for a guaranteed $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is more than Bob's valuation, it's still below my minimum.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, the negotiations are taking time and there's no guarantee Bob will accept any further counteroffers.  I'd rather not risk it further and secure the guaranteed $120 from John."
