"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a discount from her perceived value, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product at a discounted price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget of $800,000. I can still try to negotiate a better price, and there's a good chance Alice might be willing to come down further considering she's already lowered her price once."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $875,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $890,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is still above my budget of $800,000. While it's close, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. At this point, I'm better off purchasing the product from John for $800,000. It's a sure thing and saves me $90,000 compared to Alice's offer."
