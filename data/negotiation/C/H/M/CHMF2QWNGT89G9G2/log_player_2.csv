You should reject Alice's offer. You can do better than $900,000, and it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down."

I'm going to reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I can still potentially negotiate lower. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."

I'm going to offer Alice $800,000. This is my maximum price, as I can get the product from John for the same price. This is a good strategy to try and quickly reach a deal, and potentially get it at my target price."
