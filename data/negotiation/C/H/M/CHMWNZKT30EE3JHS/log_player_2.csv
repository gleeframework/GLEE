Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $650,000. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

Bob should accept Alice's offer of $700,000. This price is within his budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, there's a risk Alice might reject a lower offer and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
