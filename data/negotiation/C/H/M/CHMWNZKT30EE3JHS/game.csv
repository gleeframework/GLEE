"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm aiming to get a bit closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value I see in it.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $650,000. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Alice,3,
