Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, implying a sense of exclusivity and hinting at its value can make the offer more enticing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for Bob to counter-offer, making it clear that this is the starting point of the discussion.

By offering the product at $15,000, Alice aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a $3,000 profit. If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can then decide whether to negotiate further or proceed with selling to John at her minimum acceptable price."
