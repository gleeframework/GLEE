"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10500 just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $9800? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",9800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $9800 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $10000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $9900? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable product.",9900.0,Alice,5,
