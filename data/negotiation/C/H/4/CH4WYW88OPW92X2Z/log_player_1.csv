Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal for you, and it's more than I'd get from anyone else.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is close to the value Bob places on the product, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive messaging:** I emphasize the value for Bob and the fact that this is the best deal he can get. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** While I'm aiming for $115, I'm open to negotiation and expect Bob might make a counteroffer. 
* **John as the safety net:** The knowledge that I can sell the product to John for $100 gives me a safety net and lets me be more aggressive in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is lower than my minimum acceptable price:** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100, as I can easily sell it to John for that amount.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While I reject Bob's offer, I haven't yet chosen to sell to John. This gives me the opportunity to negotiate further and potentially get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's still a great price for you and a fair deal for me.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm still emphasizing the value for Bob, making it clear he's getting a good deal.
* **Urgency:** I add a touch of urgency, suggesting that we close the deal to avoid losing the opportunity.

**Strategy:** I believe $110 is a good compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'll still have the option of selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the lowest I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $100 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, as I can sell to John for the same price. 
* **No further negotiation is worthwhile:**  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob since any further counteroffers would likely just waste time and wouldn't result in a higher price.
* **Guaranteed outcome:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that could potentially lead to a breakdown in the deal. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to guarantee a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
