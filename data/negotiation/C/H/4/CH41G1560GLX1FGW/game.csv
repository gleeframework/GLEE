I believe this could be a mutually beneficial arrangement. What do you think about this proposal?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1100000 is a good step forward, I'm still hoping to get it down to $1075000.  That price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to come out ahead.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that point.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
