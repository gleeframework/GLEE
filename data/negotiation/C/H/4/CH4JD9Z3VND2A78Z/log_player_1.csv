"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $170. It's a great deal for something worth much more! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above what I consider a fair minimum ($150), but it's still less than what I know it's worth to me. This allows for some negotiation space while keeping me in a good position to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $150.  I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  It's still a great deal for you, and it lets me get closer to what I need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160}
``` 
 
I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, offering a price that's still profitable for me but closer to his offer. This demonstrates flexibility and might increase the chance of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $160, but that's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price.  I'm happy to accept his offer and sell the product to him. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by rejecting his offer and going back and forth."
