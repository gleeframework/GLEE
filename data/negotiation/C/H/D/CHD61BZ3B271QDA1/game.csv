Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. What do you think?,90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $82? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Can you consider that?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to listen. However, I'm still not willing to go below $80. How about we meet in the middle at $79? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal.",79.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $79 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $76 for the product. Can you consider that?",76.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to listen, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go below $78. It's the lowest I can go, and I'm still willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. How about we meet at $78?",78.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",75.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go below $78, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to give up any more. How about we meet at $77? It's the best I can do, and I'm willing to throw in some extra perks to make it worth your while.",77.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $75, and I'm starting to lose interest in the product. I'd rather buy it from John for $150 than pay more than $75 for it. Can you meet me at $75 or I'll have to walk away?",75.0,Bob,10,
