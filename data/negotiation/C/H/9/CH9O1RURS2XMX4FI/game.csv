"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 is your limit, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to go down to $16,500.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",16500.0,Alice,3,
