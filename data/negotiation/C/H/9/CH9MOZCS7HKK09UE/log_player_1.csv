Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) but still below John's offer ($100). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially maximize my profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price, implying a willingness to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit. 
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's room to negotiate a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and try to close the gap.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Focus on Fairness:**  The message emphasizes fairness, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Closing the Gap:**  $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it significantly narrows the gap between us and increases the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, but I also need to consider the time and effort involved in further negotiation.
* **Bob's Offer:** While $92 is still below my ideal price, it's only $8 less than John's offer and very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Time & Effort:** Continuing to negotiate could take longer and potentially result in a lower price. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and reasonably profitable sale.  The extra time and effort involved in further negotiation might not be worth the potential gain of a few more dollars."
