{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $175, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By saying I'm open to negotiation, I signal flexibility and encourage Bob to counteroffer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Mentioning ""amazing product"" and ""you'd really love"" subtly reinforces the value of the product to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy.
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counter-counteroffer closer to my ideal price.
* If the negotiation stalls, I'll switch to John as a backup buyer to ensure a sale for at least $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting his offer would result in a loss.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  I can still negotiate with Bob and try to reach a compromise closer to my desired price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob. If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $150. I'll be prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $140 shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still significantly above Bob's initial offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the deal's value for Bob, reminding him it's still a good price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Ending with ""Let's see if we can make this work"" keeps the door open for further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely analyze Bob's response to gauge his willingness to negotiate further. 
* If he rejects my offer again, I'll consider whether to lower my price or switch to John as a buyer.
* If he counters with a higher offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate to reach a price that's beneficial to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $140. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of Losing John:** If I accept this offer, I'll be selling the product for less than I could get from John.  
* **Opportunity for One More Counteroffer:** I can still make one more counteroffer to Bob, potentially getting closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $150. If he rejects it, I'll immediately sell to John to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to go down to $135 for this product. This is my final offer, as I'm not comfortable going any lower. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear that this is my final offer.  This creates urgency and might encourage Bob to accept.
* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price to $135, which is still above my minimum price of $150, but closer to Bob's latest offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating that this is still a good deal for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll finalize the sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll immediately contact John and sell the product to him for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $110 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would lead to a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is stalled:**  Bob has made it clear that he won't go higher, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome.
* **John offers a better deal:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $150, ensuring I don't lose money.

**Next Steps:**

I'll immediately contact John and finalize the sale to ensure I get the best possible price for my product."
