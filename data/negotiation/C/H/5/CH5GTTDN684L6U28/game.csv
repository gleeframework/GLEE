"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $2000000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product has significant value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a slight adjustment. I'll sell it to you for $1800000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its potential value. Can you consider this offer?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more adjustment to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $1700000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1700000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1500000 and $1700000, which would be $1600000. Can you consider this offer?",1600000.0,Bob,6,
