"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my means.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your investment.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,000 is close, but I need to get a bit more for it to make sense for me.  My final offer is $11,750. This is a great price for a product of this caliber, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $11,250. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11250.0,Bob,6,
