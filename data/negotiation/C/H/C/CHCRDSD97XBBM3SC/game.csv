"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $180. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $50 for it.  What do you think?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $50 is way too low. I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I can't go that low. How about $100? It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference closer to my budget, say $65?  That's a fair offer.",65.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is still below what I'm comfortable with. How about $85?  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
