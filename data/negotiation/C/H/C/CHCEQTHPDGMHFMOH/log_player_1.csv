Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $120 is already a very competitive price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer at $95 is a reasonable compromise. It's more than Bob initially wanted to pay and still a profit for me.  Delaying further to negotiate a potential $5 gain carries the risk that Bob walks away, leaving me to take John's $100 offer."
