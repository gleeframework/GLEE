,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but that's my final offer. I'd appreciate it if you could meet me at that price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
