"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? I'm really keen on this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $130 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go down to $105 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $110? It's a fair price and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $110. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about $118? It's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",118.0,Alice,5,
