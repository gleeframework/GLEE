"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think $9000 is a bit too low. I can do $11000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about other interested buyers, so I'd like to make a deal with you now if possible.",11000.0,Alice,5,
