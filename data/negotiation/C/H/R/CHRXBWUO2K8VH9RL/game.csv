"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to do $125?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a little high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $130. It's a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go back to my original offer of $130. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $132.50. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",132.5,Alice,5,
