Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go back to my original offer of $130. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $132.50. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5.
