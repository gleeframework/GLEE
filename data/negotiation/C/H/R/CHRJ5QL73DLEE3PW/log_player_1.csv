Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you'll recognize its immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  The product has a high floor price ($1,000,000) thanks to John's guaranteed purchase. This allows for a bolder opening offer.
* **Perceived Value:**  By stating that Bob will ""recognize its immense value,"" the message aims to subtly inflate the perceived worth in his mind.
* **Exclusivity:** Emphasizing an ""exclusive opportunity"" creates a sense of scarcity and urgency. 

**The Goal:** The aim is to secure a price significantly higher than John's offer, capitalizing on Bob's potential strong interest and the product's inherent value to him."
