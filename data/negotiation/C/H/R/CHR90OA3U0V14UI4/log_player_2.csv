Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Explanation:  While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $8,000. You can get the product for your maximum price from John right now, eliminating the risk of further negotiation."
