"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a maximum of $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
