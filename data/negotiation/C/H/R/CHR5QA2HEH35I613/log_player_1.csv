{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, $600,000 is far too low. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a ways off from that number. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and keeps us both under our target prices. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $725,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
