"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a ways off from that number. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and keeps us both under our target prices.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $725,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
