"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. Let's make this happen!

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's find common ground and close this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $725,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice has come down to her own valuation of the product.  There's no guarantee of getting a better price, and continuing to negotiate risks either overpaying or missing the deal altogether."
