"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further. It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to buying from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount while still offering a price that's higher than Alice's minimum. This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, increasing the likelihood of a negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, but $13,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and only $1,000 more than Bob's counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also increases the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the most logical decision at this point."
