"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Alice. It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, $950,000 is higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value that this product holds for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the previous round, it's still too high. Bob can likely get a better price with further negotiation.  There are still many rounds left, and Bob can aim for a price closer to his ideal range."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're committed to your offer of $850,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I'm placing on the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price range.  While it's still slightly higher than Bob's previous offer, it's a good deal considering that Bob could still buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $125,000."
