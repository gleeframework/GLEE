"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, $950,000 is higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value that this product holds for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that this product has significant value to me, and I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're committed to your offer of $850,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I'm placing on the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,
