Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for it. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000.

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer. While Bob is moving closer to our desired price, we have room to negotiate further and see if we can draw him up higher."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I respect your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price, Alice. However, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,775,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer, but in smaller increments. Accepting at $1,775,000 secures a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob decreasing his offer or stalling negotiations further."
