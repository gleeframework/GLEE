"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. My asking price is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to me, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for some room to lower the price if necessary, and incentivizes Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to close the deal quickly, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try to get closer to my desired price.  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though.  How about $150? That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I am still hoping to get closer to $150. I believe that there is room for negotiation and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $140. How about $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my target price of $150, Bob has been consistent with his counteroffers. Accepting his offer at $135 ensures a quick sale and brings me closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. I also don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $150."
