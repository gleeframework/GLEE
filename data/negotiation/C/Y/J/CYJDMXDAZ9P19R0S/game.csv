"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $8,000. Would you consider $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $7,250 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle for $7,750? That's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate the compromise. How about we split the difference again and settle on $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,6,
