"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1200000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $950000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving you a good deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925000. I think this is a fair price that balances the product's value to me with my budget constraints. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $950000, as that's the minimum I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $912500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving you a good deal. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
