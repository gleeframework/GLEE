"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to you and the potential for us to make a successful deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is your target price, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a good profit, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to make a deal. Let me know what you think!",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the fact that we're both looking for a successful deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $775,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",775000.0,Alice,5,
