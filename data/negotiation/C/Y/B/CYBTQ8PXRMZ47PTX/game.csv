"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, as you've indicated a value of $800,000. I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
