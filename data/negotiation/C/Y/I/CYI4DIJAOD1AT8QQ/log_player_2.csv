"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting price is a bit high. It's better to negotiate and try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally good to start with a counteroffer a bit below your target price to leave room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message aims to be polite and show interest while also clearly stating the price is too high. 
* **Targeting a Fair Deal:**  A price of $85 gives Alice some profit while still being a good deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! However, $85 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved a bit, $92.50 is still significantly above her value for the product ($80). There's room to negotiate further.
* **Avoiding a Hasty Decision:**  We're only on Round 3 of 10. There's no need to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progression:**  Moving up to $90 shows a willingness to negotiate but in smaller increments. This signals to Alice that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **""Fair Price"" Framing:**  Using the term ""fair price"" can make Alice more amenable, even if she doesn't fully agree. It suggests a sense of compromise.
* **Time Consideration:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation. While we don't want to rush, making a slightly more appealing offer might speed up the process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalling Tactics:** Alice's price movement is very small, and her messages sound like she's trying to stall.  We need to signal that our patience is limited.
* **Alternative Option:**  The option to buy from John for $120 becomes more appealing as the negotiations drag on and the price with Alice remains high.
* **Maintaining Position:** We've made a reasonable offer at $90; there's no need to jump significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your time, but I'm starting to think we might not reach an agreement. My best offer is $91.  If you're not able to accept that, I'll need to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 91
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** It's time to signal strongly that this is our limit. By saying ""best offer"" and mentioning ""other options"" (John), we convey a sense of urgency.
* **Small Concession:**  Moving up to $91 is a very minor concession to show we are still negotiating in good faith, but it's unlikely to sway Alice if she's firmly set on a higher price.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're over halfway through the rounds. We need to push for a decision or move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to make a final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet! I'm willing to meet you at $92, but that's as low as I can go 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has finally budged significantly and is now offering a price very close to Bob's last offer.  
* **Limited Rounds:** With only a few rounds remaining, the potential gains from further haggling are minimal compared to the risk of Alice not budging further.
* **Saving Money:** $92 is still a significant saving compared to John's price of $120. 

At this point, the deal is reasonable, and it's in Bob's best interest to accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
