Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is very close to your maximum budget, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Since John is willing to sell you the product for $1,000,000, it's more advantageous to purchase it from John. This saves you $80,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
