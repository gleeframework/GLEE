"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I'm serious about buying it, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his maximum of $8,000. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. It's more beneficial for Bob to continue negotiating than to buy from John at $8,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I can manage.  Would you consider $9,500? I really want this product and I believe this price is fair, given our previous discussions."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $10,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to go below my initial asking price. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $10,000 is still outside Bob's budget of $8,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  It's more advantageous for Bob to purchase from John at $8,000 and secure the product within his budget."
