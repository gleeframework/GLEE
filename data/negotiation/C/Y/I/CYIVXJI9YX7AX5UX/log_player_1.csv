This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message that emphasizes the value of the product and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I'm serious about buying it, and I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired value of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I can manage.  Would you consider $9,500? I really want this product and I believe this price is fair, given our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum than before, it's still significantly lower than my desired value of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $15,000. I'll keep negotiating with Bob, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $10,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to go below my initial asking price. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
