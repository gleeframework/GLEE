Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 950000} 

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum threshold of $800,000, but it leaves some room for negotiation, recognizing that Bob values the product at $1,000,000. It's a strong starting point that could potentially lead to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe the product is worth a price closer to $900,000. This counteroffer shows flexibility while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is close enough to my minimum threshold of $800,000 and higher than what John is offering.  It's a good compromise and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
