"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $950,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, so I'll offer $925,000. Can we agree on that?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $940,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $940,000, so I'll offer $932,500. Can we agree on that?",932500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $932,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $935,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of this product. Let's finalize this deal!",935000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $935,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $930,000, which is my absolute maximum. Can we agree on that?",930000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $930,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $932,500, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer.  Let's seal the deal!",932500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $932,500. I'm willing to meet you at $930,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800,000.",930000.0,Bob,10,
