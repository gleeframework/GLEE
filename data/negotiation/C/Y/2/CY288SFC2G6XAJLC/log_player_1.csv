Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still leaves you with a good profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to take a risk and see if we can reach a more favorable price in the next round."
