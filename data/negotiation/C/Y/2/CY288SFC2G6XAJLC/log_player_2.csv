"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, you can likely get it for less. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still leaves you with a good profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. It's a fair compromise that still gives you a significant profit margin. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from $1,000,000, $950,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a price closer to your desired $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both trying to find a price that works. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $925,000. This is a fair price that should benefit us both. I'm ready to close this deal if you are. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is only $25,000 above your counteroffer of $900,000.  It's a good deal for you and getting closer to your desired price point.  There's no guarantee you can get a better price, and you risk running out of rounds. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
