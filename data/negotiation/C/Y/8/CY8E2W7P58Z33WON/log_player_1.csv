Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it would be a great value for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high but reasonable:**  While we know John will buy the product for $150, starting with an offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($80) increases the chance of a sale without dropping the price too low initially. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $120 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing Alice to potentially secure a price higher than $80 but lower than $150. 
* **Polite and encouraging:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob and encouraging him to consider the offer."
