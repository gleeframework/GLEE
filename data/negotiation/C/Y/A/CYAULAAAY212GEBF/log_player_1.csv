Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Knowing Bob values the product at $12,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at that price, starting higher allows room for negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The message implies flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer. This makes a deal more likely than a firm, take-it-or-leave-it price.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the phrase ""given its value"" hints at its importance, potentially justifying a higher price in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You have a strong position knowing your minimum acceptable price is $12,000."
