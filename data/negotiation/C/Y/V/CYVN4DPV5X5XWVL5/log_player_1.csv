{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's lower than my minimum price of $12,000, but it gives Bob a good discount.  If he rejects, I'll have to see what counter-offer he makes and decide if it's worth negotiating further, or if I should just sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000 and far less than my initial offer of $10,000.  I'm going to try and get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a good deal for both of us, as I can afford it and you can still make a profit.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price of $12,000 and only slightly below my previous offer of $9,500.  Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale with a reasonable profit."
