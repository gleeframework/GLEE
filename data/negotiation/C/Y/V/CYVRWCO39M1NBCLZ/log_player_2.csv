"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a lower price than you would elsewhere, and I get a quick sale without the hassle of searching for another buyer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  That would leave us both with a fair deal, and I could avoid the time and effort of finding another buyer.
