"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very attractive, but it's still worth trying to get a better deal.  Since we have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, it's a good strategy to see if we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While the price is appealing, I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount.  This puts pressure on Alice to negotiate. We're still within our budget, but leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. We're still within our budget, and we have 7 rounds left to try and get a lower price. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to make further concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still hoping we can find a price that's more in line with my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our offer slightly from the previous round, showing that we're serious about making a deal. This counteroffer is still well below Alice's latest offer, demonstrating that we're willing to negotiate but also trying to stay within our budget. We have enough rounds left to potentially negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the original price I was willing to accept was $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to our desired price, but there is still room for negotiation. We're still within our budget and have enough rounds left to see if we can get a better deal. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice and gives us a chance to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still hoping for a lower price. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value we both see in it and the progress we've made in our negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now offering Alice's original asking price. This signals that we are serious about making a deal while still leaving room for Alice to make a final concession.  We have four rounds left, and this counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved significantly closer to our desired price, and we are now only $25,000 apart. With only three rounds left, it's likely we won't be able to negotiate further, and the risk of losing the deal to John becomes greater. Accepting this offer allows us to secure the product at a favorable price within our budget."
