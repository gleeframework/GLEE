"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $145.  Let's meet in the middle.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $145 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $140 is closer, but I still need to make a reasonable profit.  How about we settle at $142? That's a fair compromise.",142.0,Alice,5,
