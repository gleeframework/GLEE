Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm aiming to sell it for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is offering the absolute minimum I'd accept.  There's no room for negotiation left.
