"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $15000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but I'm not sure I can go higher. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. How about we try to find a compromise? I'm willing to meet you at $12200? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",12200.0,Alice,5,
