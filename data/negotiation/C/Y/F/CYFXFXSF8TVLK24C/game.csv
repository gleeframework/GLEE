"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done my research and I believe the product is worth $1,200,000 to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the $1,100,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This is my final offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your time and effort to find a compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already found an alternative offer from John for $1,200,000, and I'm willing to take it if we can't agree on a price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000. If you're willing to sell at this price, I'd be happy to do business with you. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
