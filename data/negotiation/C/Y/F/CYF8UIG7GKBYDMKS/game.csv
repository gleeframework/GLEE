"While I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $13,000?  It's a fair compromise and would allow us to both make a good deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500, which is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can shake hands on this price.",14500.0,Alice,5,
