"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, but $6,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we settle at $7,500? I believe that's a reasonable compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can meet you at $9,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,5,
