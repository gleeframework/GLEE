Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate, but still significantly above your minimum acceptable price, leaving you with a substantial profit.  I'll be watching Bob's response carefully to see if we can reach a deal that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not ideal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise. There's a chance we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to stick with my initial counteroffer.  It's a fair compromise considering Bob's initial rejection. I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's also likely that continued negotiation will only result in smaller concessions from both sides. Accepting this offer ensures a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or even a stalemate."
