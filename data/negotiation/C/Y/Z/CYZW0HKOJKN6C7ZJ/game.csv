"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  I understand you're a discerning buyer, so I'm offering it to you for $950000. This gives you a significant advantage, and ensures I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,
