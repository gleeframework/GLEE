"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $13000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13000 is as high as you're willing to go, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $13500, which is still a good deal for you, but I need to stay above my minimum of $10000 to make it worthwhile for me. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm counteroffering at $13250. That's as high as I can go, but I'm really interested in this product. Can you consider that?",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $13250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $13750. This is as low as I can go, and I really think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach your minimum price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500 one more time, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at $13500, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000. Can you reconsider?",13500.0,Bob,8,
