"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. You should definitely try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable negotiating range. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still more than your maximum price and what John offers. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $120?  That's a fair price and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree."",

}
```

We are now at your maximum price. This offer makes it clear that this is the highest price you are willing to pay and prompts a quick decision from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you for $120. I've already come down from $180 to $140, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

```

Alice is unlikely to go down to $120.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for your target price."
