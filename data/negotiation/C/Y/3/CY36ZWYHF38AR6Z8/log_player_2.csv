"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John. He should try to negotiate with Alice but keep John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob should start by offering his maximum price, which is $12,000. This is the price he is willing to pay and also the price he can get from John. This sets the tone for the negotiation and makes it clear what Bob's limits are."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, it's still too high. He can get the product from John for $12,000, so he should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly. $13,000 is still within his budget and closer to Alice's last offer. This shows that he's willing to negotiate but still has a clear limit. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and possibly reach a deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,500 is getting closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $12,000 from John.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price, but he should be prepared to buy from John if a deal can't be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

Bob should continue to slowly increase his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate while still staying within his budget.  $13,500 is a reasonable compromise between his last offer and Alice's. With only 4 rounds left, it's crucial to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While $14,000 is still above his ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise. He has only 3 rounds left and considering Alice's previous offers, it's unlikely he can get a better price. Buying from John is still an option, but accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to secure the product without risking a deal falling through."
