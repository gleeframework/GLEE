"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $900000.

This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to consider another compromise. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1050000, which is closer to your offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.

"I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I've already reduced the price significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $1026250. This is the final offer I'm willing to make. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1026250.0,Alice,9,
