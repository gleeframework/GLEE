Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high with Bob. This leaves space for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification for price:**  Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly implies that the product is worth more than Bob might initially think.
* **Leaving the door open:**  Phrases like ""suggesting a price"" and ""let me know what you think"" encourage negotiation and make Bob feel like he has a say in the process. 

By aiming high initially, you maximize your chances of either getting a premium price from Bob or still securing a good deal with John as a backup."
