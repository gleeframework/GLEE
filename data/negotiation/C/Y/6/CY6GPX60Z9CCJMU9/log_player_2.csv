Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $890,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering a price of $912,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and at $912,500 it's a reasonable deal. Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away and leaving you to buy from John at the higher price."
