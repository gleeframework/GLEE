"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle on $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering a price of $950,000. This is my best compromise, and I'm confident we can work something out.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $900,000. Would you be willing to consider $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit off on the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'm offering a price of $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this incredible product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with this negotiation. $925,000 is very close, but I think we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle on $890,000? That's a significant compromise from my initial offer.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $890,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering a price of $912,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",912500.0,Alice,7,
