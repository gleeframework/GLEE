"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $90 for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and a price I'm comfortable with.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $75 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise.  What do you say?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $85 is close, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
