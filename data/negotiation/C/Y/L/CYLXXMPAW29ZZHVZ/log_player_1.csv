Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $19,000, but am open to discussing a fair price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but potentially within negotiation range gives you room to maneuver.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message aims to gauge Bob's interest level. If he's immediately turned off by $19,000, you know he might be very price-sensitive. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** By expressing openness to discuss the price, you invite Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price above your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's negotiation style or how much he truly values the product.
* There's a risk Bob might be offended by the high initial price and refuse to negotiate. 
* Observe Bob's reactions to your offer to adjust your approach in subsequent communications."
