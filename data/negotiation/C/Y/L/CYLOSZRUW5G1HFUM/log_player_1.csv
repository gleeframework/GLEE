Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it above this price means Bob needs to see potential profit or significant value.
* **Time Pressure (Slight):**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a subtle sense of urgency without being too aggressive.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** While aiming high, the offer leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially leading to a faster deal. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on Alice's risk tolerance and knowledge of Bob's negotiating style, she might adjust the price and message."
