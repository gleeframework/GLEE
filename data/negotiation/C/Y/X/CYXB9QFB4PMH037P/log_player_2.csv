You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's below his maximum budget, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. By rejecting, he can make a counteroffer and try to close the gap between his desired price and Alice's asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $950,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $1,500,000. Accepting this offer saves him $400,000 compared to buying from John.  While he could continue negotiating, the potential savings are not significant enough to risk losing the deal entirely."
