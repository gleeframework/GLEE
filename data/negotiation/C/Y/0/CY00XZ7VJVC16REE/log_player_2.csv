"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. He values the product at $120, so there's room for bargaining.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the quality of the product. I'm willing to go up to $100, but I'm not sure I can go higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $105, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $100. While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal. Accepting the offer at $105 is a reasonable compromise and secures the product for a good price."
