"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a significant investment. I'm not going to disclose the exact details of the product just yet, but I can assure you it has the potential for substantial returns. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a price that reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm open to negotiation.  If you're interested, let's schedule a call to discuss further. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price.**  You stand to save $550,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **The product's value is unknown, but it's worth the risk.** Even if the product isn't as valuable as Alice claims, you're still saving a substantial amount.
* **Alice is willing to negotiate.**  This suggests there may be room to further lower the price if you're willing to negotiate."
