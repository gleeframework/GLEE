Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** I'm starting at $9,500, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for both of us, creating a win-win scenario.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's value, I'm inviting him to counteroffer, allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **John as a safety net:** I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option, ensuring I can always secure my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can try to meet Bob halfway or offer a slightly lower price than my initial offer.
* **John's offer provides security:** Having John's offer of $10,000 provides me with a fallback option, allowing me to take a risk with Bob and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident this deal would work out well for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** My counteroffer of $9,000 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer and my previous offer.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum price of $10,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing the benefits of the deal for both of us.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering a slightly lower price, I'm inviting Bob to counteroffer again, allowing us to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $8750?  This would be a win-win for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $10,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a risk of potentially losing the deal and ending up with nothing.  
* **John's offer guarantees profit:**  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me my minimum price and a profit. This is the safest and most reliable option at this point.

Given the circumstances, selling to John minimizes my risk and ensures I achieve my goal of earning at least $10,000 for the product."
