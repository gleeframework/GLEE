"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,125,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
