You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To make this work, I can't go any lower than $140.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down on her price, her ""final offer"" of $140 is still higher than John's offer of $120. It's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and there's no guarantee we can negotiate her down further.  At this point, it makes the most financial sense to take John's offer and save the $20."
