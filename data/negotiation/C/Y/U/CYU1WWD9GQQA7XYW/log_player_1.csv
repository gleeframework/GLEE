Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,500, which is halfway between my minimum price and the estimated value to Bob. This allows for negotiation space while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Friendly Approach:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've left the message open-ended, inviting Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer. This keeps the negotiation fluid.

**Next Steps:**

I will monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer or rejection. If he rejects, I will consider making a lower counteroffer, but I will be prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations become too unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is at my minimum acceptable price. Accepting it would mean no profit for me.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly values the product at $15,000, meaning he's willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John immediately would secure a guaranteed $10,000, but it would be a missed opportunity to potentially earn more.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer of $12,500, while still acknowledging his budget constraints. I'll aim to find a price point that balances my desire for a good profit with the potential for a successful deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. While $10,000 is my minimum, I can come down to $11,500 to show my willingness to work with you. This still allows me a reasonable profit, and it's a significant step closer to your desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer of $11,500 is halfway between my previous offer of $12,500 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I've reiterated my understanding of Bob's budget constraints to show I'm taking his situation seriously. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I've used a question at the end to keep the conversation open and encourage Bob to respond with a counteroffer or acceptance.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and be prepared to negotiate further. I'm hoping to close the deal at $11,500, but I'm willing to come down slightly more if necessary to secure the sale. If Bob continues to be unyielding, I'll consider selling to John as a backup plan."
