"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. This allows for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120 and even below his own perceived value of $100. I need to hold firm and see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $102.50, which is a fair compromise. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit shy of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $99.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $99.5 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, the negotiation is taking a long time. I've already gone through 6 rounds, and it seems like Bob isn't willing to go any higher.  To ensure I get my desired price, I'll sell the product to John for $120. It's guaranteed money and saves me the hassle of further negotiation."
