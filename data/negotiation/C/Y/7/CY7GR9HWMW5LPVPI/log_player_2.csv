"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable item. It's a rare and exclusive product that I'm sure you'll find very interesting. Would you like to purchase it from me for $1200000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's offer. Since Bob's goal is to save money, rejecting Alice's offer makes sense.  He can get the same product from John for the same price. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer in this situation."
