Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and would be a great asset to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum desired price of $12,000. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** $14,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000), giving him room to negotiate if he wants. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You can still make a profit if Bob counters with a lower offer, and you can also make a counteroffer to his counteroffer.

This strategy allows you to potentially get a better price than John's offer, while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer.  

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000.  
* **Fair compromise:** $12,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below the value he places on the product ($15,000).
* **Above my minimum:**  This price is above my minimum desired price of $12,000, ensuring I make a profit. 

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us and moves the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price, Alice. How about $11,750? That's a fair compromise, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's counteroffer of $11,750 is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still below the $12,000 that John is willing to pay. Given this, it makes more sense to sell the product to John and secure a guaranteed profit.  

I'm confident that I can get a better price in the future with another buyer, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob potentially resulting in an even lower price."
