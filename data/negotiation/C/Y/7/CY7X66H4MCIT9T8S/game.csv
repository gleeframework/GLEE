"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price, Alice. How about $11,750? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",11750.0,Bob,4,
