"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and worth every penny! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she is offering it for $140. This means there is room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. That's a good deal for both of us!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $135, which is within my budget of $150 and a good deal for me. It's better to accept this offer than risk further negotiation or going to John and paying $150."
