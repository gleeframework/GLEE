# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it can bring to your operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $920,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is my minimum price, but I'm willing to make a slight concession to $915,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $915,000. While this is still above my initial target, it's below my maximum budget of $1,500,000 and close to a reasonable price. There's always a risk that further negotiation will result in a lower price, but the chance of a better offer is not worth the potential of losing the deal entirely. I'm willing to accept this offer."
