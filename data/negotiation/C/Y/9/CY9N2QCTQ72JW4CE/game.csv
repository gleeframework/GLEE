"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.

Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $920,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $920,000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $880,000. This is a solid price for both of us, ensuring a fair deal. Let's find common ground here.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is my minimum price, but I'm willing to make a slight concession to $915,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",915000.0,Alice,5,
