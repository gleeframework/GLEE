Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

Here's why this strategy is chosen:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Aiming for a price around $1,250,000 allows Alice to potentially gain significantly more than John's offer. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price above $800,000.
* **Justifying the Price:** The message highlights the product's ""value"" without being overly specific, subtly encouraging Bob to consider its worth to him ($1,500,000).

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, leading to further negotiation. However, this strategy provides a strong starting point for Alice to maximize her potential profit."
