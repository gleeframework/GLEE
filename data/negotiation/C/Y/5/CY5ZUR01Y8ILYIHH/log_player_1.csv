Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire [product description].  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's a strong investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. This allows us both to make a decent profit and keeps the deal within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than $800,000 from John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $950,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product for both of us.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $900,000.  This price allows us both to achieve a significant return on our investment. Let's keep the conversation going to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is tempting, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
