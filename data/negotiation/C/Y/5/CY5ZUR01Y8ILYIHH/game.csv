"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire [product description].  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's a strong investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. This allows us both to make a decent profit and keeps the deal within my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product for both of us.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $900,000.  This price allows us both to achieve a significant return on our investment. Let's keep the conversation going to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm proposing a final price of $887,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to profit while respecting each other's needs. I believe this is a mutually beneficial solution.",887500.0,Alice,5,
