"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value you placed on the product and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. This would be a fair price that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I could meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's inherent value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
