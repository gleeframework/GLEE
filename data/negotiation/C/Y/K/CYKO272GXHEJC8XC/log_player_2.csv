"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than the product's value to Alice ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **You have more to gain by negotiating.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** Only choose this option if negotiations with Alice fail completely."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I could meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's inherent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still high.**  While it's a step down from her initial price, it's still above the product's value to her and higher than your desired price.
* **You can still try to negotiate further.**  There's likely still room for a price that's acceptable to both parties. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  It's better to continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
