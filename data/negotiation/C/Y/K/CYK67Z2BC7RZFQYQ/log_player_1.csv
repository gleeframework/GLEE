Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **The floor:** I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so that's my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Potential upside:**  I'm trying to maximize my profit, so I'm offering a higher price hoping Bob values the product even more. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If Bob rejects, I'll still get $1,000,000 from John. However, by offering a higher price, I have the chance of earning significantly more. 

This offer strikes a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring a guaranteed minimum return."
