Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $100 is less than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It shows you're flexible:** By offering a price lower than what you believe the product is worth to Bob, you're showing that you're open to negotiating. 

This approach allows for a balanced negotiation while still ensuring you make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $90.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still above your minimum of $80 and represents a good profit margin. It's also likely that further negotiation will only take longer and may not result in a higher price.  Accepting his offer is the most efficient way to secure a good deal."
