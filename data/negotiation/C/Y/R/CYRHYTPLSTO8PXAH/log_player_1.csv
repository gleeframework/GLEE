Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer the product for $100 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $99 is a good balance. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80) but still attractive enough that he might consider it a deal.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing anything as you have John lined up to buy it at your desired minimum price."
