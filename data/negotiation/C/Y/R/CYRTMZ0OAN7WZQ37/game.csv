"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is too far below my minimum.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum.",8000.0,Alice,3,
