Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $95 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired amount without further negotiation."
