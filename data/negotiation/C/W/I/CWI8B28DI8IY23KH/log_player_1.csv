"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price, while still being significantly above my minimum value of $1,200,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for this product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum value.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price or at least reach a point where it's worth selling to Bob instead of John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000. This is only $50,000 above my minimum value, so I'm getting closer to my limit. I hope this shows Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal and encourages him to make a final counteroffer closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum. It's not likely he'll go higher in the remaining rounds. To guarantee I don't end up with less than my minimum, I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000."
