{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) but lower than Bob's perceived value ($15,000). 
* **Positive message:**  A friendly tone can encourage Bob to consider the offer and potentially be more open to negotiating.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** By starting at $14,000, I leave room to negotiate while still ensuring a good profit.
* **Encourage negotiation:** A reasonable starting offer can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing me to potentially reach a higher final price.
* **Have a backup plan:**  The threat of selling to John for $12,000 gives me leverage in case Bob is unwilling to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $13,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000.  

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiate further:** I'm willing to take the risk of a counteroffer to potentially increase my profit. 
* **Potential for compromise:** Bob's offer indicates he's willing to negotiate. I can try to bridge the gap in the next round.
* **Maximize gains:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is still an option, but I want to see if I can secure a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $13,500?  I believe that's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I've countered with $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $13,000. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm staying friendly and emphasizing the fairness of the offer.
* **Strategic compromise:** This counteroffer shows my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal. 

**Strategy:**

* **Increase profit:** This offer moves me closer to my desired price of $14,000.
* **Build momentum:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a quick acceptance or a final counteroffer from Bob that I can either accept or reject. 
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm not rushing into a deal but am also not closing the door to a potentially better outcome."
