Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging that Bob values the product more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below your ideal price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while also demonstrating that I'm not willing to accept a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only slightly higher than the previous round, but it's closer to my ideal price point and significantly better than selling to John.  It's time to close the deal and secure a good profit."
