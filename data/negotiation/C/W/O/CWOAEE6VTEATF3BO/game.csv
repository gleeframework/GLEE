"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and a good starting point for us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm very interested in your product, and I'm prepared to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it leaves room for us both to come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too far below what I need for this product.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us and gives us a chance to reach an agreement. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal. Let's make it happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  However, $900,000 still doesn't quite cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to come down to $925,000. This shows a good faith effort from both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's close this!",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price that works best for both of us. Let's meet in the middle again at $910,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's within my budget. I'm confident that we can close this deal if you agree to this price.",910000.0,Bob,6,
