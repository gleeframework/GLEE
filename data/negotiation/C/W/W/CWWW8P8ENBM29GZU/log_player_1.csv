Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to let it go for $120."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but lower than my minimum ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $120 is a fair starting point. It allows for potential compromise and creates a starting point for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, focusing on his potential enjoyment of the product.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully sold the product and earned a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I will analyze his counteroffer and continue negotiating based on the information provided. 
* **If the negotiation stalls:** I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $90 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $90, but potentially lower than my initial offer. 
* **Negotiation:** I will continue to negotiate with Bob until either:
    * We reach an agreement on a price I find acceptable.
    * The negotiation stalls, and I choose to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from the initial $120. 
* **Maintain Profit:**  $105 is still above Bob's offer and significantly higher than my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive and inviting further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully sold the product for a price that works for both of us.
* **If Bob rejects:** I will analyze his counteroffer and proceed with a counteroffer of my own, or consider selling to John if further negotiation seems unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $92 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential to negotiate further:** Although Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price. 
* **John is a backup:** I have the option to sell to John for $150, so I'm not under immense pressure to accept Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still lower than my previous offer.  I will aim for a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Continue Negotiation:** I will continue to negotiate with Bob until either we reach an agreement or I decide to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. How about we split the difference and go with $98? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 98} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer.
* **Closer to my minimum:** $98 is still above my minimum acceptable price and is much closer to my desired range.
* **Finality:** I'm suggesting this is the final offer to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great!  We have a deal. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I will consider my options:
    *  If Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum, I will likely accept John's offer.
    * If Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum, I might consider making one last counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far off from what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum:** $85 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful:**  Bob has consistently offered prices below my minimum, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profitable sale and avoids the risk of continued negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will sell the product to John."
