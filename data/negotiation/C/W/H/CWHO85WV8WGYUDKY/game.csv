"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15,000 is my absolute minimum.  It's a fair price for the value you'll get from this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",15000.0,Alice,3,
