Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I can always counteroffer again or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below $13,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? It's a fair compromise, and it still leaves you with a great value."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $12,500 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $13,000? It's still a bit of a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
