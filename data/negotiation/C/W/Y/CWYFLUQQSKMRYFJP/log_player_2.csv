# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $12,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.

While $11,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  I'll try to counteroffer one more time before considering John's offer."
