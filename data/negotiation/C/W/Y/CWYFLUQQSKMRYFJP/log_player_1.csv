Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is:

* **Above your minimum:**  $12,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, allowing for potential profit. 
* **Below Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is lower than the $15,000 Bob values the product at, giving him room to negotiate.

This approach allows for some back and forth and the possibility of a higher final price. Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000 if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still lower than your desired profit margin. You can likely negotiate a higher price, so rejecting his offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Maintains your profit margin:**  $11,000 is still higher than your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Shows flexibility:**  It demonstrates you're willing to negotiate, but also maintains a price point that you're comfortable with.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter with a slightly higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  If we can't agree on that, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still above your minimum of $8,000, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get you a significantly higher price. Accepting his offer ensures you get a good profit and avoids the risk of him walking away completely."
