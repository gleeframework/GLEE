{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer represents a significant profit for me, while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. It also shows that I'm willing to be flexible, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm hoping for.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer is close to my minimum acceptable price and allows me to secure a significant profit.  It's a better deal than selling to John, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
