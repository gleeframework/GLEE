Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $17,000.  This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my price range.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I feel that's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your final offer. I appreciate the unique features, but $15,500 is still pushing my budget. I could meet you halfway at $12,750.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $12,750 is tempting, it's still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer of $15,000.  

* **Time Value:**  Further negotiation with Bob might not yield a significantly better offer, and it delays the sale.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John represents a sure thing at my desired minimum price.

It's a better business decision to sell to John at this point."
