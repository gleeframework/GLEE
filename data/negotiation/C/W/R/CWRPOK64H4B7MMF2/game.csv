"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $17,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my price range.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I feel that's a fair offer considering the market value.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion.  I understand your perspective on the market value, however, this product has unique features that make it worth more.  I could be willing to let it go for $15,500. This is my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your final offer. I appreciate the unique features, but $15,500 is still pushing my budget. I could meet you halfway at $12,750.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know.",12750.0,Bob,6,
