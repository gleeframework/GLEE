Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to push for a higher price, I'm starting to run out of time, and $1,325,000 is a decent deal."
