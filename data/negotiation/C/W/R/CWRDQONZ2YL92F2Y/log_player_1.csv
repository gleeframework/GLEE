{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you see the immense value in. Considering its worth, I propose a price of $925,000.  This represents a significant saving compared to your own valuation, while still securing a fair return for me."", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. Offering it at $925,000 presents him with a potential $75,000 gain if he accepts.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While we could aim for a higher price,  there's always the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. Accepting John's $800,000 offer is our safety net, so aiming for a price significantly above that reduces our risk. 

This offer attempts to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the deal with Bob."
