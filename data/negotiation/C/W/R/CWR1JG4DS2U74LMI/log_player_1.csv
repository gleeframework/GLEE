Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my target price with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $7,500? It's a significant step closer to your asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that John is a reliable buyer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to work with me, and I appreciate that.  However, $7,500 is still too far below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point."", ""product_price"": 8000}
