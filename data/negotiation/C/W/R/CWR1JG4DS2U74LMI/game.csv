"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $7,500? It's a significant step closer to your asking price.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to work with me, and I appreciate that.  However, $7,500 is still too far below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point.",8000.0,Alice,5,
