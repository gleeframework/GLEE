"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum because I know Bob has some value for the product. 
* **Leaving Room:** The price is also below the price John is offering, so there's room for negotiation if Bob is willing to play. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm being friendly in my message, aiming to build a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $65 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John offers $100, I'm not in a rush to sell and want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $90?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $110 to $90. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a decent price.
* **Fair Offer:**  $90 is a fair middle ground considering my minimum of $100 and Bob's offer of $65.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we both have a price in mind. How about we settle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I want to see if I can get a higher offer.
* **Time Remaining:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating and try to get closer to my target. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John offers $100,  I'm not in a rush to sell and I believe I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:**  I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is halfway between Bob's last offer of $75 and my previous offer of $90.
* **Positive & Persuasive:**  I use a positive tone, reminding Bob that I'm willing to make this deal work."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we are getting close. I'm willing to offer $78 as my final offer.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price slightly above $78 and see if Bob is willing to budge.
* **John's Offer:**  John offers $100, but I'm not ready to sell yet.  I'm hopeful I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer.  I'm willing to come down to $82.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 82} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price again to $82, which is just above Bob's offer of $78 and still above my minimum of $100.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the desire to close the deal. This may encourage Bob to accept or to make a final counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still not ready to sell to John. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
