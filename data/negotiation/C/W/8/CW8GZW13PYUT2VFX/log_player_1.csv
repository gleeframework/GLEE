Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my minimum price. I'll try to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,400,000 is still significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where we stand, Alice. Let me propose a price of $1,550,000. This is higher than my previous offer but still within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,550,000 is a good deal, and it's very close to my minimum.  There's a chance I could get a better price in future rounds, but there's also the risk that Bob will walk away, or I'll have to sell to John at a lower price.  It's better to lock in this deal now."
