"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do like the product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $11,000? That's my best offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13,500. That's the lowest I can go.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $13,500 is still pushing it for me.  I could go up to $11,500.  Think about it - that's almost a 50/50 split from your last offer and mine.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you at $11,500. I'll give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. That's as low as I can go.",13000.0,Alice,7,
