"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still give you a great deal, and I'd be able to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 just doesn't quite work for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a deal we can both be happy with.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $9,750 just won't work for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $10,000, which is closer to your last offer and still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,8,
