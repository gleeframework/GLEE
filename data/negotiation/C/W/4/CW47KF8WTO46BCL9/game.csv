"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is unfortunately out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $13,500 to be happy. How about we meet at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still above my budget.  I'm ready to pay $9,500 for this product.  That's a fair compromise that would allow both of us to come away with a good deal.  Let's make it happen.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $13,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $12,500 is still quite a stretch for me.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made some concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. I need to make a profit, and I'm getting close to my minimum price. Let's see if we can make it work.",11000.0,Alice,9,
