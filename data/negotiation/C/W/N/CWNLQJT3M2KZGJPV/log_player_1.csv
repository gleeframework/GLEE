"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. My asking price is $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you and its potential benefits.  Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the product's worth to Bob to justify the price.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm open to discussion, signaling flexibility and a willingness to reach a compromise.

This strategy aims to establish a strong initial position while keeping the door open for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the potential benefits. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's counteroffer is low, it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. There's still room to explore a higher price.
* **Seeking a Better Deal:**  I'm confident I can push for a better deal in the next round. 

By rejecting the offer, I keep the negotiation alive and explore a higher price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the product's true value and gives you a substantial savings compared to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain High Price:**  I'm dropping my price, but still keeping it well above Bob's offer. This shows a commitment to finding a solution but doesn't give away too much.
* **Focus on Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify the price.
* **Compromise:**  The message emphasizes a willingness to compromise and find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Call to Action:**  I urge Bob to accept the counteroffer to close the deal.

This approach aims to continue the negotiation while pushing for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."

I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the potential benefits. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to raise your offer. While it's getting closer, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product while still giving you a significant savings from my initial offer.  Let's close this deal with a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're getting closer, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the potential benefits. I'm willing to compromise further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $1,100,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already in Round 6, and there's a risk that Bob will continue to haggle, or I might reach the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Sell to John:**  The offer is close enough that if I reject it, I might end up selling to John for a significantly higher price, but it's not a guaranteed outcome.

Accepting the offer minimizes the risk of getting a lower price or not selling at all. It also allows me to secure a decent profit in a timely manner."
