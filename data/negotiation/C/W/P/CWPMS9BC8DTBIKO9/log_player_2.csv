Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

Alice is still asking for a price higher than your maximum budget. Even though you could try to negotiate further, it's more efficient and reliable to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation rounds."
