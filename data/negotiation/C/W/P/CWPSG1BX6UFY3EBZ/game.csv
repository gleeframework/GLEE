"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It has the potential to be incredibly valuable, and I believe it would be a great asset to your business.  I'm starting with a price of $1200000, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and negotiating a fair deal.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $1000000? This would still leave room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1000000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $950000? I think that's a fair compromise that would benefit both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
