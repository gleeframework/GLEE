"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I understand the value of the product to you, but it's worth significantly more to me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a great investment.",15000.0,Alice,3,
