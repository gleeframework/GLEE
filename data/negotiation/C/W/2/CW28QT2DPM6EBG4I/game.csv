"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000, reflecting the value I see and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product to you is significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value I see in the product, and given your lower limit of $800,000,  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This price strikes a balance and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
