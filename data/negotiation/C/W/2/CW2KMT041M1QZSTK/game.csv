"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is considerably below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but no more. Can you meet me at that price?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price.  To be honest, $800,000 is the absolute lowest I could consider.  However, I value your time and interest in this product. Would you consider a final offer of $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $850,000. Can you consider $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
