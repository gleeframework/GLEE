"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. It's a premium product, and I believe it's worth every penny. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and consider $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product is premium, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1050000. I'm willing to make a final offer of $900000, which is my absolute limit. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
