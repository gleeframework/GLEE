"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,900,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value of the product, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 falls significantly short of what I believe the product is worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,700,000 is still above my budget. Let's try $1,400,000. This is closer to my initial offer and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
