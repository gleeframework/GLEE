Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer, and still giving me a significant profit."
