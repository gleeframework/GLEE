Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This offer is time-sensitive as I have another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, getting Bob to buy it allows us to potentially make a profit beyond that.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,350,000 is carefully chosen:
    * It's significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($1,200,000), giving us room to negotiate down if needed.
    * It's still a good deal lower than John's offer, making it attractive to Bob if he truly values the product. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning another interested party and framing the offer as ""time-sensitive,"" we introduce a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly."
