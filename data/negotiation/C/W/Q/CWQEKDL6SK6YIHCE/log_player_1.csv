{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'm going to try and get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  It's clear this product is valuable to you. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This price still leaves room for you to profit, and I can get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's getting closer. I'm going to try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate your efforts.  However,  $11,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to my target price.  How about $13,000? That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will still be very beneficial to you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, we are getting close! I'm ready to make this happen. Would you consider $12,000? That's the most I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already negotiated with him for several rounds and there's a risk of further counter-offers that might push the price down even further. To secure a guaranteed profit and avoid any more negotiation, I'll sell to John for $15,000."
