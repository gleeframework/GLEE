Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  It's clear this product is valuable to you. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This price still leaves room for you to profit, and I can get closer to my desired price. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate your efforts.  However,  $11,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to my target price.  How about $13,000? That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will still be very beneficial to you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.
