"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good deal, but still leaving room for negotiation.  $1,100,000 is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price,  but it's also a large enough gap that Bob will likely counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$950,000 is still too low for me, considering my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have 9 rounds left, and I can still sell to John for a better price if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by lowering my offer to $1,050,000. This is still above his offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hopeful this will be a more acceptable price for Bob, but I'm prepared to go through a few more rounds of negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$900,000 is still too low for me. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm still willing to negotiate with Bob, but I'm also mindful of my minimum acceptable price and the fact that I can sell to John for a much higher price. I have 6 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to $1,000,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable price for him. If he still refuses, I'll have to consider my options more seriously, including selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally want. I have 4 rounds left and I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'll also be keeping a close eye on the option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference between my last offer and Bob's last offer. $950,000 is a decent compromise, and it's still a profitable deal for me. I'm hoping this will finally be a price that Bob is willing to accept. If not, I'll need to start seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob refusing to budge much, I'm going to sell the product to John. While I would have preferred to get closer to my ideal price,  $1,200,000 is a good deal and ensures I meet my minimum requirement."
