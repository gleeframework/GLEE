{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far beyond your budget. It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price, even if it means risking the deal. You have a solid alternative with John, so rejecting Alice's offer is a reasonable first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is your best possible offer, as you're willing to pay John $800,000. It's a bold move, but it forces Alice to consider your position.  If she's really interested in selling, she'll likely counter with a price closer to your offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and her current offer is only $50,000 over your budget. At this point, it's probably worth accepting the offer.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might get frustrated and walk away, leaving you with only the option of buying from John at a higher price."
