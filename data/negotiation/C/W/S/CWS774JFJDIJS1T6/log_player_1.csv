Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but even if he pushes for a lower price, there's a good chance we can settle on a number higher than John's $1,000,000 offer. 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity. 
 
**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, I might adjust my offer slightly."
