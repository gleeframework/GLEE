"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm not sure I can go that high. The product is worth $8000 to me, so I'd be willing to pay $8250 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9000. It's a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8500.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8750, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can get closer to the sweet spot.",8750.0,Alice,5,
