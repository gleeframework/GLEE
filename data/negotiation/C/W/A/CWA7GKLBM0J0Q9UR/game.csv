"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  How about we start the conversation at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I understand your perspective. Let's meet in the middle a bit â€“ how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thanks for your flexibility. I've been giving this some thought, and to be completely transparent, I have a hard limit at $1,200,000 for this. It's already a very competitive price for what you're getting.  Would you be willing to consider that?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
