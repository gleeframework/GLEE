"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $700,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $550,000?",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. Considering our initial discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product at a price of $650,000. This is a competitive offer, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a reasonable price.",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $650,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me.  Could we settle on a price of $600,000?  I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm offering the product at a price of $620,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable and reflects the product's worth.",620000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as high as $610,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm offering the product at a price of $615,000.
