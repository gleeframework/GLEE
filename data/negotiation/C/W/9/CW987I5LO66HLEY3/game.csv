"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I can't go lower than $16,000.  What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value you're placing on it.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
