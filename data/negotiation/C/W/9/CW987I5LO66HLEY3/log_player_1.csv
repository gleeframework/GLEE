Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price. I believe the product is worth more and I can negotiate a better deal.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I can't go lower than $16,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value you're placing on it.  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
