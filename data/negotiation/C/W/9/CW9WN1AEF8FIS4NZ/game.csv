"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to go up to $100, what do you think?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit steep for you. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $140. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to go up to $120. If you're willing to meet me at that price, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",120.0,Bob,6,
