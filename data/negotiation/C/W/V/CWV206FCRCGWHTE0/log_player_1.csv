Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  It allows you a good profit margin while giving me a significant discount. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round.  While selling to John is an option, I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,100,000. This price still gives you a good value for the product while allowing me a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000. This price allows me to make the purchase while still giving you a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to my desired range and is significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  It's time to close the deal."
