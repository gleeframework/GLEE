"Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10000? Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $10000 is a bit too low for me, as I value the product at more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This would allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's still a good price for the value you'll receive.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12500 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm still very interested in the product, and I'm willing to go up to $11000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
