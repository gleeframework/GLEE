Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $10000 is a bit too low for me, as I value the product at more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This would allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's still a good price for the value you'll receive.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
