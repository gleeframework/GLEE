"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to me than that. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,500?  That gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's try to find a compromise. How about $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make this final offer.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,000, so I'll offer $9,750. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,6,
