{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to me than that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Giving him some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** Leaving room for potential counteroffers while still securing a decent profit. 
* **It's a strong opening:** Showing you're confident in the value of your product.

Remember, this is just the first step. Be prepared to negotiate and adjust your offer based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to that extent. It's worth trying to get closer to my target by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,500?  That gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm still confident that I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's try to find a compromise. How about $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make this final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,000, so I'll offer $9,750. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,750 is a decent offer and not too far from my desired price, I've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to get me closer to my goal of $15,000.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially losing him as a buyer is too high. 

Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I get my desired price and minimizes the risk of a prolonged negotiation with Bob."
