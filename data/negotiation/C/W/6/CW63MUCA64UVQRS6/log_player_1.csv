Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This offer is very close to my desired price, and I'd rather not risk losing the deal altogether by being too stubborn.  $122.50 is a good compromise."
