"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that's worth at least $100 to me, and I know it's worth $100 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a great deal for both of us - I get a little extra, and you get something you value! Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,1,
