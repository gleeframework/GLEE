{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys it for $800,000 (your minimum acceptable price).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $925,000 aims to capture a significant portion of Bob's potential profit while still leaving him with a compelling incentive to buy.  
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you have John as a backup, it's always best to secure the highest possible price. This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
