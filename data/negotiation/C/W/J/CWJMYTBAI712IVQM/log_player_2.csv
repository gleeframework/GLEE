Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,500, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. I think it's a fair price for the product, considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,500.  You've signaled your top end is around $11,500.  It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation to potentially save a small amount. John offers a guaranteed price of $15,000, which is a reasonable outcome in this situation."
