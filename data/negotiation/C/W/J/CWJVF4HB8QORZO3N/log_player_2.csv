"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start the conversation with an initial offer of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way above his budget, and he has room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the value you've mentioned it has to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down a bit, $925,000 is still too high for Bob. He should reject and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm already willing to pay more than John's offer."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to reach my minimum threshold. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I've mentioned it has to me. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still too high. At this point, Bob is better off buying from John for $800,000. There's a risk of Alice continuing to hold out for a higher price, and Bob is running out of rounds."
