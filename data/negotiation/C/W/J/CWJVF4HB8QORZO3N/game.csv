"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start the conversation with an initial offer of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the value you've mentioned it has to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm already willing to pay more than John's offer.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to reach my minimum threshold. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I've mentioned it has to me. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
