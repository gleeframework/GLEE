"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and while my ideal price is above your initial estimate, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $2,000,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high.  It's important to signal that you're serious about a price closer to your budget, but walking away immediately might not be the best strategy yet. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product fits into my budget closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly on price?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:** By starting with a much lower offer, we aim to shift the negotiation's anchor point. This can influence Alice's perception of what's possible.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  We don't want to start too close to our absolute limit ($800,000) just yet. This gives us space to increase our offer incrementally if needed. 
* **Gauging Flexibility:** Alice's response will tell us how flexible she might be on price. If she's unwilling to move much, we might need to consider John's offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a more realistic figure. How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000?  This reflects my willingness to find common ground while acknowledging the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $1,350,000 is still significantly higher than our $800,000 limit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Her willingness to meet ""halfway"" (even if it's based on an inflated starting point) suggests there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Time Consideration:** We have several rounds left. We can afford to be patient and see if we can bring Alice closer to a reasonable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  To be frank, I have other options closer to $800,000.  If you could come down to $950,000, I think we could reach a deal today."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Alternatives:** By mentioning we have other options, we subtly increase the pressure on Alice. This lets her know we're not desperate to make this deal at any cost. 
* **Significant but Justifiable Jump:**  Moving up to $950,000 is a considerable increase from our previous offer. However, it's still well below Alice's last offer and demonstrates our willingness to compromise if she's serious about finding a middle ground.
* **Creating Urgency:** Using phrases like ""reach a deal today"" can help expedite the negotiation and encourage a quicker response from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm keen on making this work. However, to be transparent, I have another offer on the table closer to my asking price.  To avoid losing this opportunity, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Tactic:** Alice is trying to create urgency by mentioning another offer. This could be a bluff to force us into a quick decision. 
* **Still Too High:** $1,200,000 is a significant amount over our budget. Accepting would mean overpaying by $400,000. 
* **Final Offer Claim:**  People rarely make their ""final offer"" unless they're pushed. We haven't reached a point where further negotiation seems impossible.

**Next Steps:** We'll call her bluff, but we need to be careful in the next round. We'll make one more counter-offer close to our limit. If she rejects it, we might have to walk away and go with John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, to be completely transparent with you, my absolute limit for this product is $850,000.  I believe that's a fair offer, especially considering I have other options available.  If you're unable to meet this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore those alternatives."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  We're now presenting our near-final offer, leaving a small buffer above our absolute limit in case Alice tries for one last price reduction.
* **Transparency and Justification:** By being transparent about our budget limit and alternative options, we're aiming to demonstrate seriousness and the need for Alice to make a decision.
* **Polite but Firm:**  We maintain a polite tone but stand firm on our position. This signals that we're not willing to be pushed further and are prepared to walk away if necessary.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Alice Accepts:** Ideal scenario, we get the product at a price within our budget.
* **Alice Counters:** She might try to negotiate slightly above our offer.  We'll need to decide if it's worth accepting or if it's time to go with John.
* **Alice Rejects:**  We'll likely move forward with buying from John at $800,000."
