I believe it holds immense value, and while my ideal price is above your initial estimate, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product fits into my budget closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly on price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a more realistic figure. How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000?  This reflects my willingness to find common ground while acknowledging the product's value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  To be frank, I have other options closer to $800,000.  If you could come down to $950,000, I think we could reach a deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer, it's still substantially less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if Bob will move closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm keen on making this work. However, to be transparent, I have another offer on the table closer to my asking price.  To avoid losing this opportunity, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, to be completely transparent with you, my absolute limit for this product is $850,000.  I believe that's a fair offer, especially considering I have other options available.  If you're unable to meet this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore those alternatives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to move significantly from his initial offer range. His final offer of $850,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price and even further from John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. Continuing negotiations with Bob is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
