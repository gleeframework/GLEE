"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice is offering it for $150, which is your maximum price. However, you know you can buy the product from John for the same price. Since there's no advantage to buying from Alice at this price, rejecting the offer and buying from John makes more sense."
