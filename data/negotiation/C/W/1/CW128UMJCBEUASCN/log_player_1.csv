"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my costs. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm offering $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
