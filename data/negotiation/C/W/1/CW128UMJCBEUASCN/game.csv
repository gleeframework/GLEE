"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my costs. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm offering $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
