I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a fair price considering the product is worth $15,000 to him. I'm also leaving some room for negotiation, as he may try to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but it's still more than what I would get from John.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $13,500. This is a compromise that's still closer to my initial offer, but shows that I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good deal. It's higher than what I would get from John, and it's a good compromise considering our back and forth. I'll accept his offer."
