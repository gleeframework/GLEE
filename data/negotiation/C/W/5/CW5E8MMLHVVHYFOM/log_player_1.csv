Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000.  This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would prefer to get a higher price for the product, Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting too close to my minimum. I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000 to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get a fair price."
