"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000.  I'm confident it can bring you considerable value."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""unique opportunity"" and ""significant investment,"" I frame the product as having premium value, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I aim for the best deal, I'm aware of John's standing offer. My opening price factors in the potential need to negotiate down while still exceeding John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that initial price is quite steep. I appreciate the product's value, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we bring it down to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value of the product. This suggests he has room to move, and accepting now would leave a lot of money on the table. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,500,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Step Down but Above Minimum:** I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer, signaling flexibility, but I remain well above both my minimum and Bob's lowball offer.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the ""unique benefits"" to steer Bob away from fixating solely on the price and back towards the value the product brings.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** By framing my counteroffer as seeking a ""middle ground,"" I'm encouraging a collaborative negotiation rather than a confrontational standoff."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. However, that price is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000 and see if we can find an agreement there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, securing a profit.
* **Strong Position:** While I could push for more, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and meet closer to the middle ground. This indicates his serious interest in the product.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation has its own costs. Accepting now ensures a quick and favorable deal, rather than risking further back-and-forth."
