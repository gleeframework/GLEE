Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider it?

We are nearing the end of the negotiations, and while I am confident I could secure a slightly higher price with Bob, the risk of failing to reach an agreement is increasing. It's getting too close to the deadline.  It's better to secure the $1,200,000 from John and avoid any potential risks."
