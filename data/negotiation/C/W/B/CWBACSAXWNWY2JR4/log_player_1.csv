"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also highlighting the product's value to pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not eager to settle for it so early in the negotiation. I believe there's room to increase the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $17,500.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm moving down the price slightly, showing flexibility, but still holding out for a price closer to my initial target. I'm also highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect for Bob to incentivize him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. John is a safe option at $15,000, but I'm willing to risk it for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my last offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility. I'm emphasizing ""fairness"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below $15,000. With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I get my minimum and don't waste more time negotiating."
