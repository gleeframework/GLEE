"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's valued at $800,000 and I believe it holds immense value for you. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $700,000. Can you consider this offer?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This takes into account your interest and allows me to get closer to the product's true value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
