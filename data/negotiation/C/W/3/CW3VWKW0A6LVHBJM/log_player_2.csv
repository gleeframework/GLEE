"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) to leave room for negotiation and gauge Alice's flexibility.  
* **Expressing Interest:**  While my offer is low, I want to convey that I'm genuinely interested and willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $6,000 is too far below my value for this.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While $7,500 is better, it's still above John's price.  Alice coming down suggests she's open to negotiation. 
* **Aiming Lower:** I'll try another counteroffer, aiming closer to my $8,000 limit while trying to meet Alice somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $6,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 6750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but not drastically.  This shows I'm willing to move, but I'm still aiming for a good deal.
* **Compromise Language:** I'm framing this as a fair compromise to encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is closer to my $8,000 limit, leaving me some wiggle room if needed while still being significantly below Alice's starting price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $6,750 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $7,125.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it's a price I can accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we are getting closer to a potential agreement.
* **Still Below John:** $7,125 is still a better deal than buying from John, so it's worth trying to push a little further. 

I'll make one more counteroffer, aiming slightly below John's price to see if Alice will accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this is really getting close! I appreciate you moving on the price.  What if we settle at $7,000 even? That's a solid deal for me, and it gets us over the finish line."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This is my last attempt to get a price below John's offer.
* **Round Number:**  We're past the halfway point in the rounds.  If Alice is truly motivated to sell, she might accept this offer rather than risk it going to John.
* **Clean Number:** Offering a clean $7,000 might make it seem more appealing psychologically."
