"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $180.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($180) to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a price that's beneficial for me. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I emphasize the product's worth to me to hint at its value and encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  I want to start high enough to have room for negotiation without risking having to sell to John for the minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $120 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I don't want to sell for this price, especially since I have John as a backup buyer. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I can still potentially get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation and demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell at his initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is my absolute minimum, I'm confident this product is worth more than that. I'm willing to come down to $150.  This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price higher than my minimum.
* **Value Justification:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value to justify my counter-offer. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm framing the counter-offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the potential benefits he'll get from purchasing the product at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still have some room to negotiate.  Selling to John would be a guaranteed $120, but there's a good chance I can get more from Bob.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and show that I am not desperate to sell immediately. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob has shown some willingness to increase his offer. There's a chance he might be willing to go a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $140 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll go down to $145. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm again offering a price that's in the middle of our previous offers. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price higher than my minimum.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and create a win-win situation. 
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** By reducing my offer to $145, I'm signaling that I'm nearing my bottom line, making it more likely that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $15 away from my minimum acceptable price. While I'd ideally get closer to $145, I'm running out of rounds.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he might walk away, leaving me with only the option of selling to John for $120. 
* **Minimizing Loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and earn $15 more than my absolute minimum.  

Given the limited number of rounds remaining, it's more strategic to accept Bob's offer and avoid the potential for a complete loss of negotiation."
