# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a price closer to $750,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. This is a fair compromise that I hope you'll consider. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

While I could try to negotiate further, $825,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's a significant savings compared to John's offer and  Alice seems firm on her price."
