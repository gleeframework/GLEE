"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $95? It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy.",95.0,Bob,4,
