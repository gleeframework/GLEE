"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to start. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I value the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
