"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While Alice's offer is higher than her valuation, it's still lower than John's offer. This means buying from Alice saves Bob $100,000. 
* **The product is valuable to Bob:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so even paying $900,000 is a worthwhile investment."
