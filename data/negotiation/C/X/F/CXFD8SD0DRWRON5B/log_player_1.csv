Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit. Bob is willing to pay $800,000, so there's room to negotiate upwards.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation but still ensures a significant profit even if Bob manages to bring the price down somewhat. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer quickly."
