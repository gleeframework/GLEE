"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $9000? This would still be a good deal for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but unfortunately $8750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8900, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Alice,5,
