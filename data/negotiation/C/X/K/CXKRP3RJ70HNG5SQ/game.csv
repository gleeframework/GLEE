"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true market value.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 just isn't feasible for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product to you while ensuring I can still make a decent profit. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get to $1,200,000 or lower. How about we meet at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
