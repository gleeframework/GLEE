"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'll counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm feeling the pressure, I believe I can still get closer to my target price. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 just isn't feasible for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product to you while ensuring I can still make a decent profit. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get to $1,200,000 or lower. How about we meet at $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,225,000 is still a good deal, and I'm concerned about running out of rounds. This deal ensures I get a profit, and it's a better outcome than selling to John."
