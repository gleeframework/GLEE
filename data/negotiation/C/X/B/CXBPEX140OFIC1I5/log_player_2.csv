"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers excellent value at this price, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. This suggests there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is a fair price considering your own valuation of the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is cutting it a bit close for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 represents a compromise, moving closer to Bob's desired price of $13,000. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** While further negotiation might be possible, accepting the offer avoids the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially making a new, higher counteroffer.
* **Staying within budget:** $13,500 is still within Bob's budget of $15,000, allowing Bob to purchase the product without exceeding his limit."
