"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, close to Bob's estimated value, but leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A higher initial offer increases the chance of a good deal for me.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob immediately rejects, it tells me he's willing to play hardball. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  I can still lower the price slightly if needed, while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price and closer to my minimum acceptable value.  

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer to try and bridge the gap.  My goal is to secure a price closer to my initial offer, which will maximize my profit."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering with a price of $1,350,000. This represents a compromise from my initial offer and a slight increase from Bob's offer. This approach aims to:

* **Maintain a strong negotiating position:** I'm showing willingness to compromise while still seeking a favorable price.
* **Test Bob's limits:**  This counter-offer will reveal whether Bob is willing to meet me halfway.
* **Keep the negotiation moving forward:** It avoids a stalemate and increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not satisfied with the deal.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to secure a higher price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with further negotiation, and selling to John would leave me with a significant amount of money on the table."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Keep the pressure on Bob:** While lowering my price, I'm still not conceding to his last offer, putting pressure on him to reconsider.
* **Avoid a stalemate:** This counter-offer keeps the negotiations moving towards a potential agreement."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is the same as his initial offer, which I rejected earlier.  While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can get a higher price with continued negotiation.  Selling to John would leave a significant amount of money on the table, so I'm not considering that option yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}

**Explanation:**

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,275,000. This is a small compromise from my previous offer but is still higher than Bob's last offer. This approach aims to:

* **Show willingness to compromise:** By lowering my price, I'm demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Test Bob's limits:**  This counter-offer will reveal whether Bob is willing to increase his offer.
* **Keep the negotiations active:**  It prevents a stalemate and keeps us moving toward a potential deal.

I'm now close to my minimum acceptable value, but I'm still hoping to secure a higher price.  If Bob rejects this offer, I may need to consider selling to John in the next round."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob is still not willing to budge much.  While $1,225,000 is a decent price, it's still lower than what I was hoping for. Selling to John for $1,000,000 will secure a deal and ensure I don't lose out entirely.  It's a tough decision, but with limited rounds left, it's the most practical choice to ensure a guaranteed sale."
