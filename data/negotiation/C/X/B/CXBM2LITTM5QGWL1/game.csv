"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is exceptional,  $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need $925,000 to make it worth my while.",925000.0,Alice,5,
