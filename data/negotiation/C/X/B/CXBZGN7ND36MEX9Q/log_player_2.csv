You can do better than $90. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:

You are still better off than buying from John, and there's a good chance Alice will come down further.  Let's counteroffer again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $89.50 is still a bit high for me. How about $86?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 86}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I can meet you at $87, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's the lowest price I can offer and still make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87

Alice is firm on her price and you're only saving $3 by continuing.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best choice."
