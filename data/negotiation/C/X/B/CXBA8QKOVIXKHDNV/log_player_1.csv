Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA because you have John willing to pay $1,500,000. This is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Perspective:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He'd ideally want to pay less, but anything significantly above that is a loss for him.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The ZOPA exists between $1,200,000 (Bob's maximum) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.  Going too close to $1,200,000 leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're confidently stating the product's value.
* **High Anchor:** $1,400,000 sets a high starting point for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** You're subtly reminding Bob of the product's benefits, implying he'll make back the investment.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob is likely to counter-offer. Be ready to negotiate down slightly, but hold firm closer to $1,500,000.
* **Time is a Factor:** If Bob delays or doesn't seem genuinely interested, don't hesitate to move on to John. Your BATNA is strong."
