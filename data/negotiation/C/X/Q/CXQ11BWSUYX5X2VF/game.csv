"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to stay under $10000.  I'm willing to offer $9500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to stay under $10000, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business and the potential for future collaborations.",10500.0,Bob,4,

This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings to your business.",11250.0,Alice,5,
