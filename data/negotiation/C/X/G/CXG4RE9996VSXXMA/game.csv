"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below my bottom line. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
