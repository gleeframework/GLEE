"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding an agreement that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This price is fair and allows for a profitable sale for you while staying within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This offer reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This allows for a significant profit for you while staying within my financial constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
