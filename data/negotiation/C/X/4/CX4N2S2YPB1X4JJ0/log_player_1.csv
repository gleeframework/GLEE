"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you, so I think this is a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is better than selling to John,  I want to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,750?  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a little more for my investment."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I think $13,250 would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up a bit from his previous offer, and we're now at a price point where I'm earning a decent profit. While I'd prefer more, accepting his offer is the most sensible choice at this point. Further negotiation might take too many rounds and risk losing the sale altogether."
