"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant profit.  $1,400,000 is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly more than my minimum acceptable price.  This offer should also incentivize Bob to counteroffer instead of immediately rejecting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my target. I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise,  moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a significant profit. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate while keeping the price above my minimum acceptable level.  This offer will hopefully be more enticing to Bob than his previous counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price. It's a risk to reject, but I'm willing to take it to see if I can secure a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering again at $1,250,000. This is a further compromise, showing flexibility. It is still a profitable price for me and significantly higher than John's offer. With six rounds left, I'm trying to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay. If he rejects this, I'll have to reconsider my strategy more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is too low. While it's only $50,000 less than John's offer, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and there is little chance of Bob coming up to my desired price in the remaining four rounds.  It's a strategic decision to secure a guaranteed profit rather than chasing a slightly higher price with increasing risk of rejection."
