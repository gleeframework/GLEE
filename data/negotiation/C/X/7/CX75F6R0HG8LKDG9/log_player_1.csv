Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $120.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $120, it's still below your initial offer of $140.  You have room to negotiate further and see if you can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. How about $135? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a bit of room to compromise."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Moves you closer to your desired price:**  It's a smaller step than your initial offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Provides a reason for your counteroffer:**  ""A great deal"" and ""room to compromise"" make it sound reasonable.
* **Leaves some room for further negotiation:** Bob still has a chance to negotiate a lower price, but you're not conceding too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I'm willing to go up to $135. How about $128? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay under $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $128 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $120, and you have already rejected two offers from him.  It's likely that any further negotiation will result in a price closer to your minimum, or even lower. It's best to accept his offer and secure a sale."
