"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe holds significant value. While I can't disclose all the details at this point, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  I'm asking for $900000 for it. This is a fair price considering its potential, and it leaves room for negotiation. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further.
