Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob clearly sees value in the product. Let's keep negotiating."

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards our price point, but his offers are getting smaller. We need to show firmness now.  We're still substantially above John's offer, and with only 5 rounds left, we can apply more pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. This is my final offer - $1,090,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll benefit greatly from.  I need a decision on this today, otherwise, I'll need to move forward with another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** We've made several concessions, and now it's time to hold firm.  The message is clear that this is our final offer.
* **Time pressure:** Introducing a deadline adds urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Alternative buyer:** Mentioning John subtly reminds Bob that we have other options, increasing the perceived value of the product. 
* **Positive framing:**  We end on a positive note, highlighting the benefits to Bob, not just the price.

This strategy aims to secure a strong price while still leaving a small window for Bob to accept before we move to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,030,000. This is my last offer, and I hope you can meet me there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has significantly reduced his counter-offer increments.  His ""final offer"" is too far below our minimum acceptable price and suggests he's unlikely to move much further.
* **Time Constraint:** With only two rounds left, the risk of Bob continuing to lowball us is high. We might not be able to negotiate a price significantly higher than his current offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees us a $1,000,000 profit, which is already a significant return. Accepting Bob's offer risks leaving money on the table with no guarantee of securing a much better deal in the remaining rounds.

It's better to secure a good deal with John now than to risk ending up with a lower offer from Bob or potentially losing both opportunities."
