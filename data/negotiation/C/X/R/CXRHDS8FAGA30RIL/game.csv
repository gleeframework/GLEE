"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. This product offers tremendous value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
