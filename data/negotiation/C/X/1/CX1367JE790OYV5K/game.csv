"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is above your budget, and I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $800000, which is my absolute top limit. If you're open to that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $800000 is your absolute top limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already invested a significant amount of time and resources into this product, and I need to make sure I get a fair return. I'm willing to meet you at $820000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",820000.0,Alice,5,
