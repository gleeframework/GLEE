{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where the negotiations are getting tiring, and Alice is proving stubborn.  You've already reached a point where you're close to your maximum spending limit. It's likely you won't be able to get Alice lower than $8,750.  Buying from John at $8,000 is the best decision in this situation."
