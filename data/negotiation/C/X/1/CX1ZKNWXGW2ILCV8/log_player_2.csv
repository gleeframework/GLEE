Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1500000 is your maximum, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and uniqueness. I hope you can meet me halfway and make this deal happen.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final counteroffer of $1,700,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  You've already made your maximum offer, and it seems like further negotiation won't bring the price down to your desired level.  It's more efficient and financially sound to buy the product from John at $1,500,000."
