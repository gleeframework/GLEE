"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can you meet me at that price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the value of this product.  How about $950,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $950,000. How about $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $825,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $850,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,6,
