Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit above your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high value (""Given its value..."") to justify the high starting price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message expresses willingness to discuss the price, showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to engage further.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob accepts the $15,000 offer or a price close to it.
2. **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will indicate how much he values the product and how much he's willing to pay. 

You can then adjust your price in subsequent negotiations if needed, knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
