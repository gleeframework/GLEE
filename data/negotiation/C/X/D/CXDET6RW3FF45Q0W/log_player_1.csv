Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product is interesting to me, but I'm only willing to spend a fraction of your initial asking price.  How about $100,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100,000

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

While negotiating with Bob might eventually yield a higher price, his offers are escalating far too slowly. He's clearly aiming for a price well below your minimum, and it's unlikely further negotiation will bridge that gap effectively.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees your minimum acceptable outcome and avoids wasting further time on potentially fruitless negotiations."
