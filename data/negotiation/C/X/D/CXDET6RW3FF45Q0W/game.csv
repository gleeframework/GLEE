"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true significance.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product is interesting to me, but I'm only willing to spend a fraction of your initial asking price.  How about $100,000?",100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $100,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but that price is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  If you're serious about finding a deal, I'd be willing to go up to $250,000. Let me know what you think.",250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $250,000 is still below my ideal price point, I'm willing to consider a significant reduction to close this deal. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but that's still a big jump from my last offer.  To be honest, if we're not closer to $500,000, I'm not sure this will work.  I'm willing to go up to $350,000, but that's my final offer.",350000.0,Bob,6,
