"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $120 is a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $125 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $130 is still a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $145. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $145 is getting close to my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $135, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",135.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. I'm sticking with $145. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",145.0,Alice,9,

"I understand you're not willing to budge on the price, but I'm still interested in the product. However, I'm running out of options and I need to make a decision. I'm willing to make one last offer of $142. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $150.",142.0,Bob,10,
