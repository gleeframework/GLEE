Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,875, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $11,000, which is the same price I offered earlier. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept the offer. While it's not his ideal price, it's getting close. He's down to his last few rounds, and rejecting the offer could lead to a situation where he has to buy from John for a higher price.  It's a good compromise, and he's likely to save some money compared to John's offer."
