"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product is great, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and agree on $10,750?  I'm confident we can make this work.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'll meet you at $11,250, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you at $10,875.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",10875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,875, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $11,000, which is the same price I offered earlier. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
