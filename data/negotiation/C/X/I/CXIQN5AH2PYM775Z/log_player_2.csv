"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's price,  it's still significantly more than the product's value to Alice ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product's value to me is substantial. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a good price for Bob. It's still significantly less than what he would pay John, and it's closer to Alice's perceived value. Accepting the offer ensures a good deal for Bob while also reaching a mutually agreeable solution."
