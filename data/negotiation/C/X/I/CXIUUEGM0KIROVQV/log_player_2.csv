"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your max value:** You're willing to pay $120.
* **Alice's offer:** $110
* **John's offer:** $120

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay $120 to John, but you're willing to do that.  It's better to pay your max price than to overpay to Alice."
