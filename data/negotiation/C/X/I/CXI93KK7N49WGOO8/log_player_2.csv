"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the potential of this product for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $950,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing you a significant profit while ensuring I receive a strong return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can definitely do better than $950,000.  While Alice is trying to push for a ""fair"" price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a counter-offer process, potentially pushing the price down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is a good offer, it's slightly below my desired price point. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price reflects a fair balance between our respective needs, allowing for a smooth and mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process and try to push the price down even further."
