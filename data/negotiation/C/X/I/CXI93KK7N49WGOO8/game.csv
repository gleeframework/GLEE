"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This price allows both of us to benefit from the transaction, while ensuring you still receive a healthy profit margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is a good offer, it's slightly below my desired price point. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price reflects a fair balance between our respective needs, allowing for a smooth and mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Considering the value of the product to me, I can offer $875,000. This price is a fair compromise, allowing for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this transaction.",875000.0,Bob,4,
