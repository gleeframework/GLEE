"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds that price point.  I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000.  This is a very reasonable offer considering its true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth the full $1,300,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
