"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I believe the product is valuable, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $1,000,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below my minimum target. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
