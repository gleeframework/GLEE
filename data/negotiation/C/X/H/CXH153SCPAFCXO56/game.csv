"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $90.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $105? This would still give me a decent profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $100? I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",100.0,Bob,4,
