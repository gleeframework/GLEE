Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $90.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm happy he's interested, I need to make more than $90 to make this worthwhile.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $105? This would still give me a decent profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $100? I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get more, $100 is my minimum, and it's a good deal for both of us."
