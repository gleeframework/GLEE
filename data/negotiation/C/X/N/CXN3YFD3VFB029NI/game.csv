"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $18,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $18,500 is still a bit too high for me. My final offer is $17,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",17000.0,Bob,6,
