Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close. I can do $140, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $142.50. It's a small step up, but I think it's worth it for this great product.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I think we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $142, but I think that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142.

It's time to cut bait. Alice is very unlikely to go below $140, and we only have one round left after this. John's offer of $150 is now the better deal."
