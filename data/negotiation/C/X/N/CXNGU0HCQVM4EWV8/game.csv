"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but $110 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $155. Is that something you'd be interested in?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close. I can do $140, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $142.50. It's a small step up, but I think it's worth it for this great product.",142.5,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I think we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $142, but I think that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",142.0,Alice,9,
