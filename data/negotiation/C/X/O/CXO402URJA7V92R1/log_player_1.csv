Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while also demonstrating my willingness to find a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to increase his offer. I have 8 more rounds to make a deal, and I'm confident I can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5

```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for both of us and we can close the deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While $88 is getting closer to my minimum, I have time to see if I can get a better deal.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm trying to bridge the gap by meeting Bob halfway again, offering a slightly lower price. I'm hoping that this gesture will convince him to agree. I have 3 more rounds left, so I'm still in a good position to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away. I'm willing to pay $86 for the product. Can you consider that?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but it's not worth the risk of him walking away with only two rounds left. John is a guaranteed sale at my desired price, and I'm not willing to take the chance of losing a sale completely."
