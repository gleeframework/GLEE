"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $10,000.  Since the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  I'm willing to go down to $9,500 for the product. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get for it. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's still below his maximum price of $12,000 and saves him $2,500 compared to buying from John.  There's a chance Bob could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price makes accepting her offer the more prudent choice."
