"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? I believe this would still provide a good deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
