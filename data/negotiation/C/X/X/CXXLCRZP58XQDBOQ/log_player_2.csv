# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you see in the product, while also recognizing the value I place on it. I'm open to further negotiation, but I think this is a good starting point.

# Alice's message: I understand that $1,150,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal.
