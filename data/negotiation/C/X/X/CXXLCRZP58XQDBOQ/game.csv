"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for my budget right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product while still being a good deal for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you see in the product, while also recognizing the value I place on it. I'm open to further negotiation, but I think this is a good starting point.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $1,150,000? I'm eager to make this deal happen, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,150,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
