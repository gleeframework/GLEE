Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,600,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my asking price.  The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, so I need to get at least $1,600,000 to make this worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  How about $1,650,000? This gives us both some room to be happy with the deal.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for us both."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $1,625,000 for your product. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,650,000, Bob's offer is still above my minimum of $1,500,000 and represents a good compromise. It's worth taking this deal and securing the sale."
