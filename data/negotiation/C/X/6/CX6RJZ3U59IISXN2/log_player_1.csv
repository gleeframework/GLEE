Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this unique product for a price of $1,200,000.  It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your decision - I'm available to discuss any questions you might have."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:**  $1,200,000 is a compromise between your minimum desired price ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This allows for potential negotiation while still securing a profitable sale.
* **Message:** The message is friendly, highlights the value proposition for Bob, and opens the door for further discussion if needed.

**Why this approach:**

* **Maximizes potential profit:**  A $1,200,000 sale is significantly better than your fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Bob may be willing to pay a bit more, especially if he values the product highly. 
* **Maintains a positive relationship:**  A respectful and open approach can keep the door open for future business opportunities with Bob, even if he declines this offer."
