"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for negotiation.**  $800,000 is a significant discount from your $1,000,000 valuation, but you can likely get a better price.
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.**  There's no need to rush into a decision. 
* **You have a backup option.**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $1,000,000 gives you leverage.

**Next Steps:**  You'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I place on it and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  A $50,000 reduction from Alice's offer shows you're serious about buying but also leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the value you see in the product helps justify your price point.
* **Fairness:**  Emphasizing a ""fair deal"" for both parties can help build rapport."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $775000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your desire to save some money. I believe this is a reasonable and mutually beneficial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is now closer to your target price.**  $775,000 is only $25,000 away from your initial counteroffer of $750,000.
* **It's a fair compromise.**  Alice has moved closer to your position, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Time is a factor.**  While you could try to squeeze out a bit more, with 7 rounds left, it's not worth risking a deal falling apart.

**Next Steps:** You've secured a good price and are able to move forward with the purchase, saving $225,000 from your initial valuation."
