"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14500. It's a great deal for you, and it's close to my minimum price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John at $12,000, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Bob should reject the offer and go with John to get the best deal."
