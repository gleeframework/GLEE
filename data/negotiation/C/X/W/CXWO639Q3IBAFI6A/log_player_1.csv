Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is the maximum he's willing to pay, and it's below my minimum acceptable price. There's no room for negotiation to reach a price that works for both of us. John offers my minimum acceptable price, so it makes more sense to sell it to him."
