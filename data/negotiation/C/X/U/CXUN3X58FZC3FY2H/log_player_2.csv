"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this offer reflects its worth. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your maximum budget, you can do better. Rejecting this offer might lead to a counter-offer from Alice closer to her $800,000 valuation. You always have the fallback option of buying from John at $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate."
