"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $2,000,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  He should counteroffer Alice with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Bob is starting with a significant discount from Alice's offer. He's hoping to get a good deal, but he's also leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than his desired price. He should continue negotiating with Alice, potentially by counteroffering again."

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise. He's still significantly below Alice's price, but hopefully close enough to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, she's still above Bob's desired price point.  John is offering a guaranteed deal that's within Bob's budget, so it makes sense for him to end negotiations with Alice and buy from John."
