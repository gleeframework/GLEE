"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would you be willing to go down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $825,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about $750,000? That would be a great deal for me, and I'm sure we can both agree it's a fair price.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
