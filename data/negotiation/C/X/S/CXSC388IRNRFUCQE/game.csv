"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable product at a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This would allow us both to benefit from this deal.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,175,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's aim for a final price of $1,100,000.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
