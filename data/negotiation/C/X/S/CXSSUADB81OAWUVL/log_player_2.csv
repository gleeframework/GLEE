You want to save as much money as possible, and $120 is still a bit too high. It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My proposal for the product price is $100. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

$100 is a good price, it's within your budget and significantly lower than what John is offering. You can save $50 by accepting Alice's offer."
