"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8500? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the original price you mentioned.",9000.0,Bob,4,
