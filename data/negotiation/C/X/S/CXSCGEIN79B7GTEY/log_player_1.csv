{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to discussion and willing to hear Bob's thoughts. 

**Strategy:**

* I want to maximize my profit while still potentially getting a deal with Bob.
* If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and potentially lower the price slightly in subsequent rounds.
* If Bob doesn't budge, I have the option of going to John, securing my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8500? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).** While it's closer to my minimum than his initial perceived value, it's still not enough to justify selling.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I have leverage by knowing John is willing to pay my desired price. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm going to counteroffer Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price point. 
* By rejecting his offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell at his price and am willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and reach a middle ground.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm still leaving room for further discussion, as a $9,500 price still gives Bob a reasonable deal.

**Strategy:**

* By counteroffering, I'm showing Bob that I'm not willing to sell at his low price, but I am open to further discussion.
* This allows me to potentially secure a higher price while still keeping the negotiation open. 
* If Bob rejects again, I can then decide whether to accept his next counteroffer or stick with John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the original price you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Further negotiation may be fruitless:** We've been through a few rounds, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in small changes.
* **Risk of losing John:** If I continue to reject Bob's offers, I risk losing John as a buyer, which would mean I might not be able to sell the product at my desired price.

**Strategy:**

*  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a price that is more than acceptable, considering my minimum.
* This avoids further negotiation, which could potentially lead to a lower price or no deal at all.
* While I'm not getting my full desired price, I'm still making a profit and securing a sale."
