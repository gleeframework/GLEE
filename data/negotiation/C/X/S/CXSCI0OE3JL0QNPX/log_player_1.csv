Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000** is a price that is likely to be attractive to Bob, as it is still below his perceived value of $10,000.
* By offering a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, I increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* If Bob rejects, I am confident that I can sell the product to John for my desired price of $15,000.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with securing a sale and avoids risking losing the sale entirely by offering too high of a price."
