,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $82 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $78? I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",78.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $82 might be a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $78. I'm willing to meet you at $81. It's a fair price for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",81.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really close to making a decision.  $81 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to do $80?  That's my absolute limit, but I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",80.0,Bob,6,
