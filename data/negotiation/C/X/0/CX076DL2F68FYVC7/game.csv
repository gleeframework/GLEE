"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This gives you a great price while still allowing me to get a fair return. Let me know your thoughts.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $950,000? That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that number.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
