"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to consider $950,000 for this product?  I think it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,025,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  I think this would be a mutually beneficial price point.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to meet my minimum threshold. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
