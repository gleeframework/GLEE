"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only afford $85 right now.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $85 is still too low for me.  How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  Would you be willing to meet me at $90?  That's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $93 as a final compromise.  This gives us both a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",93.0,Alice,5,
