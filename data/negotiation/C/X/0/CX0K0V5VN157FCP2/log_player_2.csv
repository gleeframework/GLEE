"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  $110 is still too high for your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only afford $85 right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $85 is still too low for me.  How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $95 is closer to your budget, it's still above your target. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  Would you be willing to meet me at $90?  That's the absolute maximum I can afford right now."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $93 as a final compromise.  This gives us both a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  $93 is a bit higher than your ideal price, but it's still a good deal. It's likely you won't be able to negotiate any lower, and you risk losing the deal if you reject again."
