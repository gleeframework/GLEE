"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would that work for you?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not quite there, Alice.  $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",117.5,Bob,4,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking that $122.50 is a more reasonable price for this amazing product. Would you be willing to meet me there?",122.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating, Alice. Let's try $119.75. It's closer to my budget, and I'm confident we can find a solution we're both happy with.",119.75,Bob,6,
