"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you're open to discussing.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000,  which is closer to my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
