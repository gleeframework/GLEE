{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Start High, But Be Realistic:** I'm aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to leave room for negotiation while still securing a price significantly above my minimum ($100).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer is a starting point. I anticipate a counteroffer and am prepared to negotiate to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware that I have a fallback option with John at $100. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob, allowing me to walk away if the deal isn't beneficial enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $110 is closer to my target, it's still below my initial asking price.  Rejecting his offer signals that I'm looking for a slightly higher price and am willing to negotiate further. I'll aim for a counteroffer between $110 and $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50?"",
""product_price"": 112.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $112.50, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway between our previous offers.
* **Maintain Value:** This price still keeps me well above my minimum of $100 and ensures I make a profit. 
* **Pressure:** Offering a specific number like $112.50 can feel more concrete and encourage Bob to make a decision rather than continuing to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $111? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $110 and incrementally moving up.  While I could push for a bit more, accepting $111 is a solid outcome:

* **Profitable:** It's still a $11 profit over my minimum.
* **Avoids Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to Bob walking away, forcing me to accept John's $100 offer. 
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids further back-and-forth, freeing me up for other opportunities."
