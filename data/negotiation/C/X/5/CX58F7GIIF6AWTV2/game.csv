"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering my budget and the product's value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  While $1,800,000 is certainly appealing, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This offer reflects a balance between its worth and my desire to see it in your capable hands.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
