{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is our last round, and although I'd prefer a higher price, I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,592,500.  It's a good price considering the time constraints and the fact that John would only pay $1,500,000.  It's better to close the deal now than risk losing out entirely."
