Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000.  This reflects the unique value it offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,750,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price, it's important to keep the negotiation going. I'm going to reject his offer for now and attempt to get closer to my target price.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe there's room for negotiation.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 would be a safe option, but it's worth trying to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to counter.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,400,000 is simply too far below the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. Given our previous discussions, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum desired price.  It's a good outcome for me, considering my initial asking price was higher.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob, and I risk losing time.  Selling to John for the same price is a safe option, but there's no reason to wait when I've already reached my target price with Bob."
