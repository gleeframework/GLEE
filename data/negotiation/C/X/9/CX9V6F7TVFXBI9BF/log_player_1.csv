Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $500,000 profit margin to be split between you and Bob.

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob still sees value in the deal.  Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Aim slightly below Bob's maximum valuation to give yourself room to negotiate.
2. **Be Confident:** You have a strong fallback option with John.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  Highlights exclusivity and value to Bob. It frames the price as an investment opportunity.
* **The Price:**  $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation but secures a significant portion of the profit for you. It also ensures Bob still gains $100,000 in value.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  Your willingness to negotiate slightly downward while staying above your $1,000,000 minimum will likely result in a successful deal."
