Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start negotiations with Bob significantly above his perceived value but slightly below your guaranteed price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some space for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly anchoring the price in his mind. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit with Bob while ensuring you don't lose the opportunity to sell at your desired price to John."
