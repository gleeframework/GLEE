Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  $1,600,000 is a good starting point, but I need to be at $1,650,000 to make this work. It's a fair price considering the value this product holds.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
