{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $90.  That's a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  I'll reject her offer and see if I can get her down closer to my $100 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $85?  That's still a good profit for you and a fair deal for me."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $85 just yet.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5

Alice is coming down, but I'm still not at my ideal price point. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get her to come down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $87.50 is still a little higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm happy to split the difference with you and offer $86.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit."", ""product_price"": 86}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $86 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $88. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to make the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and I'm getting closer to my goal price.  While I'd ideally like it to be closer to $86,  $88 is within my budget and a good compromise."
