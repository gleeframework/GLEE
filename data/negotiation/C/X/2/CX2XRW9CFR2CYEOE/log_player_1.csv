{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15,000. It's a steal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $15,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Enthusiasm:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to create interest.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message doesn't close the door to counteroffers, keeping the negotiation going.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. As a smart seller, Alice will closely analyze Bob's reactions and adjust her strategy based on his counteroffers and behavior."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $10000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, rejecting it opens the door for potential gains.  

* **Negotiation leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you show you're not desperate for a quick sale and are willing to stand your ground. This puts you in a stronger position for counteroffers.
* **Potential for higher price:** Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to negotiate. There's a chance he might be willing to increase his offer if he feels he's about to lose the deal.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you can counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than your initial offer but still above his current offer.  This strategy keeps the negotiation moving while also pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $10,000 is a good price, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $12,000?  I think this price is fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  The counteroffer of $12,000 is halfway between your initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Emphasizing value:** The message reiterates the product's value and highlights the fairness of the new price.
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a positive tone, keeping the negotiation friendly and open to reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12000 is getting closer to what I'm comfortable with, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $11000?  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and a good compromise.  Accepting it:

* **Secures the deal:** It guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.
* **Maximizes potential gain:** While I might have pushed for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and ending up with $10,000 from John is not worth it.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm ensuring a sale at a price that's both fair and profitable."
