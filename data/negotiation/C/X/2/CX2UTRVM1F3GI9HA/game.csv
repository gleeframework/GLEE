"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  This is my maximum price, so I hope we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still beyond what I can afford. As I mentioned before, my absolute maximum is $800000. If you're truly interested in making a deal, this is the only price I can offer. I understand the value of the product, but this is my firm limit.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1200000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident that the product's value will be worth the investment to you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
