Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Scarcity Tactic:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:** While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message subtly implies that the product is worth the asking price by highlighting its ""value and potential."""
