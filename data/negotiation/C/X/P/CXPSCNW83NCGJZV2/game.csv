"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $9500 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10500 is the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $10500. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be happy to pay $10250 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm still a little higher than $10250, but I'm willing to make one final compromise.  If you're willing to pay $10400, we can finalize the sale. It's a great price for a product this valuable, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with it.  Let me know what you think.",10400.0,Alice,5,
