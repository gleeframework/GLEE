"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to the $12,000 mark. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $11,000? This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $11,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go to $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$10,500 is a good compromise and only $500 away from my initial counteroffer.  Considering we only have 6 rounds left, it's a good time to secure a deal, especially since John would only offer $8,000."
