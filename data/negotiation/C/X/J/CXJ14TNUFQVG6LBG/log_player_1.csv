{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it seem like I'm being reasonable.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to incentivize him to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message shows I'm open to negotiating, but I'm not giving away the farm.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer. If it's close to my minimum, I might accept.
* If Bob rejects and his counteroffer is too low, I'll counter with a slightly lower price.
* If negotiations stall, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can counter with a price closer to my desired price point and see if Bob is willing to budge.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price higher than $1,200,000, but lower than my initial offer of $1,400,000. I'll try to find a price that's appealing to Bob while still staying within my acceptable range. 
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll reassess the situation. If his counteroffers keep falling below my minimum, I'll switch to selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this work.  This still leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price higher than his last offer but lower than my previous one. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I highlight that this price is still fair, trying to appeal to his sense of reason.
* **Bridging the Gap:** I use language that emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next counteroffer. If it's still too low, I'll either counter again or consider selling to John."

Bob's offer:
