"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is better than John's offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth negotiating further to see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a price of $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget:** $1,325,000 is only $125,000 above Bob's maximum.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could counteroffer again, it's likely Alice will be less willing to budge further.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob rejects, Alice might become less willing to negotiate or even raise the price. There's a risk of losing the product altogether.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget, with a small margin for saving money.  While it might be ideal to negotiate even further, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for saving an additional $125,000."
