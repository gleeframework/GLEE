"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within budget, but $9,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet at $10,000. Would it be possible for us to discuss a price closer to $8,500? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still obtaining the product.",8500.0,Bob,4,
