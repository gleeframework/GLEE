Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so the offer needs to be significantly attractive to entice him but leave room for profit.
* **High but Reasonable:** $950,000 is a high price, but it allows Bob to gain the product for less than Alice values it while still netting Alice a significant profit if he accepts.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher payout."
