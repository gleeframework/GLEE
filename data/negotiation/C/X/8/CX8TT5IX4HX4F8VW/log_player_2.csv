"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your value and her own. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) gives you room to negotiate upwards while staying well below your $120 maximum and potentially securing a great deal. If Alice rejects this offer, you can gauge her response and adjust your next counteroffer accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $75?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but $75 is still a significant markup from her own valuation of the product. There's room for further negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal while keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $60 was probably a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $68?"",
""product_price"": 68
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer attempts to find a compromise:

* **Shows Willingness to Negotiate:**  Moving up from $60 demonstrates flexibility and a genuine interest in reaching a deal.
* **Stays Below Your Limit:**  $68 is still significantly lower than your $120 maximum, giving you room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Tests Alice's Flexibility:** By proposing a specific price rather than asking for another round of offers, you're gauging how committed Alice is to her $75 price."
