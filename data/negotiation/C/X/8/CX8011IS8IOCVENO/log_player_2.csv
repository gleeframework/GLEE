You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for much cheaper than $850,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. It's a bold move, but it sets a strong negotiation position and leaves room for compromise. It's unlikely Alice will accept this price immediately, but it will hopefully encourage her to come down from her initial price in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $725,000 is still a significant amount. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price. It's possible that you can drive the price down even further with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a middle ground between Alice's last offer and your previous counteroffer. It shows that you're willing to negotiate, but still want to pay a lower price. This strategy could lead to a quick agreement, or it might encourage Alice to make another counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to a price of $675,000, which is within your budget and a significant saving compared to buying from John.  It's reasonable to accept this offer, as further negotiation might not lead to a substantially better price and could risk losing the deal altogether."
