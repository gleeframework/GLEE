"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but I'm confident that this product has the potential to deliver even more than that for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $950,000? I think this is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $950,000 is closer to your valuation, I can't drop the price that low.  If you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, I think we have a deal. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
