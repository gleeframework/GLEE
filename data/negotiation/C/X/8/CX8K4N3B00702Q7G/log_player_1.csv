Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $13,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, Alice doesn't know this.  It's better to start with a higher offer and potentially negotiate down.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $13,000 offer leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a little high.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's potential benefit to Bob, aiming to increase his perceived value. 
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning listing the product publicly, Alice creates a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act sooner rather than later.

**Goal:** The goal is to secure a price higher than John's guaranteed $15,000 offer. If Bob rejects the $13,000, Alice can still sell to John without losing out."
