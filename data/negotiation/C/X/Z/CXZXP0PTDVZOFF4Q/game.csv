"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum asking price.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $920,000? I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",920000.0,Bob,4,
