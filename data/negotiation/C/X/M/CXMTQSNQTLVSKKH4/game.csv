"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product in excellent condition, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $15,000? That way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested!",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. That way, I can still get the product I'm interested in while staying within my means. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",13500.0,Bob,4,
