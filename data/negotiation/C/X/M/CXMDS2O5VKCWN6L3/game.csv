,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to come down to $115, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Can you meet me at $108? I'm willing to make a serious offer on the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $108 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $111. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this deal happen.",111.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $111 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. Can you consider $106? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances.",106.0,Bob,6,
