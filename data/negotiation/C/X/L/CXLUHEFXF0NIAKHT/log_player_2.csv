"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer for the product is $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While Bob could buy from John for $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget of $1,500,000 and is a good compromise.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will stick to her price, and then Bob would have to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
