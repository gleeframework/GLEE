# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, I've had significant interest in this product, and  $1,300,000 falls a bit short of what I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?  This reflects the true value and scarcity of what I'm offering.

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above my budget. I'll counter again and try to get closer to my target price."
