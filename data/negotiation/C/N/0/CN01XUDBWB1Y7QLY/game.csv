"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105? I'm really interested in your product, but I have a strict budget.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  I'm sure we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $109?  This is my final offer, as I'm not sure I can go any lower. Let me know what you think.",109.0,Alice,5,
