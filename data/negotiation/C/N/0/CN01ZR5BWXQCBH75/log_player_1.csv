Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum value I see in this product. Let's start there and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer matches my minimum, I have room to negotiate and try for a higher price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, the product's unique value justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,600,000?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is now moving in the right direction and is showing willingness to negotiate. I believe I can still get a better price than $1,300,000.  I'll keep negotiating for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of the product.  Would you consider $1,450,000?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  I'm sticking with my offer of $1,200,000. It's my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've discussed. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is firm at $1,200,000 and it's unlikely he'll go higher.  Accepting now ensures I make my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate or Bob walking away."
