"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum value I see in this product. Let's start there and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, the product's unique value justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  I'm sticking with my offer of $1,200,000. It's my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've discussed. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
