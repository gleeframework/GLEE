"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $145. This is a special offer tailored to valued individuals like yourself, considering its worth to you is $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is enticing, it's still above the product's worth to me ($120). I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the gesture, I'm looking to get the product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $135 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. For the product, I would be able to agree upon a price of $140. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $140, which is closer to my desired price point. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my offer and ending up buying from John for $150 is too high. It's a good deal for me, and I'd rather secure the product at this price."
