Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first gives me a chance to make even more profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** By starting at $140, I'm aiming slightly below my guaranteed sale price to John. This makes the offer enticing to Bob (who values it at $100) while still giving me a significant profit margin.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a possibility Bob might try to negotiate for a lower price, but the initial offer gives me a strong starting point."
