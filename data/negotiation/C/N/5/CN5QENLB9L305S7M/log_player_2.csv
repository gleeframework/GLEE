"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice's offer is at $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for counter-offering.** This gives you the opportunity to potentially secure a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** It's a guaranteed deal, but it costs the most. It's better to see if you can get a lower price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** My initial counteroffer is $900,000, which is a significant reduction from Alice's $1,000,000 offer. 
* **Midpoint:** This offer is roughly halfway between my maximum price ($1,200,000) and Alice's minimum price ($800,000). 
* **Testing the waters:** This allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's open to coming down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While closer to my desired price, $1,100,000 is still above my target.
* **Room for further negotiation:** Alice has moved closer to my price point, but there's still room to potentially get a lower price. 
* **Avoiding the John purchase:** It's still better to see if I can negotiate a lower price from Alice before resorting to the more expensive option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer of $900,000 and Alice's latest offer of $1,100,000.
* **Closer to my goal:** It's still below my maximum price of $1,200,000, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for Alice to consider.
* **Testing the waters again:** This counteroffer tests Alice's willingness to meet me halfway, and potentially leads to a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price.** While it's still slightly above my desired range, it's significantly lower than her initial offer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Rejecting this offer and counter-offering again might risk Alice walking away entirely, or her counter-offer might be higher than $1,050,000.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a decent price without risking a higher counter-offer from Alice or the need to buy from John at a much higher price."
