Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very special product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's still very attractive.  I understand this is a significant investment, so please consider this offer carefully.  I'm confident that you'll see the potential in this product. "", ""product_price"": 1,400,000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** This message is designed to be friendly and persuasive, highlighting the value of the product to Bob without revealing my minimum acceptable price. It also acknowledges the large investment and encourages careful consideration.
* **Product Price:**  I've chosen $1,400,000. This is a significant profit for me, as my minimum is $1,000,000, and it's still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,500,000. 

By offering this price, I aim to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  I'm getting $400,000 more than my minimum.
* **Increase the chances of Bob accepting:**  He's getting a good deal and potentially saving $100,000.

This strategy balances my desire for a high profit with the need to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting."
