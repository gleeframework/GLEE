"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I can do better than that, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $120, so I can offer it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you at $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really close to my budget. Can you consider one last offer of $98?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already said I'm not willing to go below $100, and I'm not willing to budge on that. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product, so I'll make one final offer: I'll meet you at $99, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",99.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm really close to my budget. I'll make one last offer: $97. Can you meet me at that price?",97.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already said I'm not willing to go below $99, and I'm not going to keep negotiating at this point. I'm starting to think you're just trying to lowball me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $99. Take it or leave it.",99.0,Alice,9,
