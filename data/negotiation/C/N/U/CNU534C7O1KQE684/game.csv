Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $700000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750000. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $900000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit too much for me.  Considering the value I'm placing on this product, I can offer $800000 as my final offer. It's a significant amount, and I'm confident it's a fair price. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $950000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to consider it.
