"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $120 to you, you can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $90 for the product? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It shows Alice that you are serious about buying the product, but you're also trying to negotiate a lower price. This leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, offering $110. This is only $10 more than your initial counteroffer, and is a good deal compared to John's price of $120.  It's worth accepting this offer and concluding the deal."
