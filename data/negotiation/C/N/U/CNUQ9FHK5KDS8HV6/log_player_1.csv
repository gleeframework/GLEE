Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  It allows for potential back and forth without immediately hitting a wall. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you can see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, you can then adjust your offer based on his counteroffer or explore selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still lower than what you're aiming for.  You have room to negotiate further, and it's worth seeing if you can get closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $13,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. How about $13,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to your initial asking price than his previous offers, and it's still a good deal for you. It's worth accepting to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether."
