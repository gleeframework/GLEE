"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Here's how to reason through this:

* **Your maximum price:** $15,000
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000
* **John's price:** $15,000

Alice's offer is less than your maximum price and less than John's price.  You save money by accepting.
