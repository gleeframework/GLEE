Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is just too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  It's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,800 and $8,200.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. We're getting close to a deal with Bob, but I'm not confident he'll come up to my desired price.  Selling to John is a safe and reliable option, and I'm satisfied with the price."
