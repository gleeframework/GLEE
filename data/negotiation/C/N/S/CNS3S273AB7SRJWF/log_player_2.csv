"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You have no information about the product's value to Alice, so there's a possibility of getting a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant counteroffer, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. Starting with a lower price creates room for potential compromise and allows us to assess Alice's minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above our target of saving as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows us to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between our previous offer of $10,000 and Alice's offer of $12,000. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming to get a price closer to our target."
