"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. My counteroffer is $1500000.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1500000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a new offer of $1700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Let me think about it for a moment. I'm willing to go up to $1600000 for the product. This is the highest amount I can afford without compromising other business needs. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1600000, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1750000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to come down in price, Alice. After careful consideration, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My final offer is $1650000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not convinced that $1650000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one last concession and offer it to you for $1725000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you can understand that I need to get the best possible price for this product.",1725000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. After further review, I believe we can agree on a price that benefits both parties. My final offer is $1675000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you.",1675000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another offer, Bob. However, I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiations, and I'm still not convinced that $1675000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to be confident that it's a fair price. I'll meet you halfway between $1675000 and my original offer of $1800000. My final offer is $1737500. This is the absolute final price I'm willing to consider.",1737500.0,Alice,9,
