"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm firm on $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
