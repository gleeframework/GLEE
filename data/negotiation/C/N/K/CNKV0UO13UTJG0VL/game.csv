"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $11,200, which is just $100 more than your last offer. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll offer you the product for $11,100, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",11100.0,Alice,7,
