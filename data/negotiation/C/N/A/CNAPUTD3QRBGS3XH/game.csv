"I understand that you're working with a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and go up to $14000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $14000, but I'm willing to meet you at $16000 again. However, I'm also considering other potential buyers, and I'd like to give you one last chance to meet my price. If you're still interested, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000, but if not, I'll have to explore other options.",16000.0,Alice,5,
