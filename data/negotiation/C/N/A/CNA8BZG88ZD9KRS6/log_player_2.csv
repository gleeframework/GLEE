Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm confident this product is worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?
