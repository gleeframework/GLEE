Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to start too low.  There's a chance he might be willing to pay more than his initial valuation.  
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $170 leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, ensuring we don't lose money. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to ensure a sale to Bob, you could adjust the starting price."
