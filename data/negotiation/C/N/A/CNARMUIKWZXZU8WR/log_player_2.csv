"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a fantastic deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your desired price range.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start a negotiation process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I understand the value of the product but I'm only able to offer $700,000 at this time.  This would still be a profitable deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I can sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still within your budget and is a significant reduction from her initial offer.  While you could potentially negotiate further, accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer or you needing to buy from John at a much higher price."
