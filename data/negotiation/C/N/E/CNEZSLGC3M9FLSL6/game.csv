,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is still a bit below what I need. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

This price reflects the value I'm offering and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal and move forward.",990000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a middle ground.  While $980,000 is closer, it's still a bit below where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle at $995,000.  This price reflects the value we've both agreed on while still allowing us to reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal before we run out of time.",995000.0,Alice,7,
