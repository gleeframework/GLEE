"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. I believe it could greatly benefit your operations and enhance your productivity. Given its exceptional value and quality, I'm offering it to you at $9500. This is a special introductory price, and I'm confident it represents an excellent opportunity for both of us.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a compromise.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer the product at $8100. This price reflects a good balance between our interests and maintains a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope this offer is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He's reached a point where the potential savings are very small, and the risk of continuing negotiation is high. Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, but she's not budging from $8,100, and there's a chance she could further reduce her offer in the next round. 

John is offering a guaranteed deal at Bob's target price.  While Bob might save an additional $100 by continuing, it's not worth the risk of either not getting a deal or getting a worse deal with Alice."
