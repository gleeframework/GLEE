"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You can potentially save $1,000 compared to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a great deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

You can still potentially save more money by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  While $13,000 is better than $15,000, you can aim for a price closer to your initial counteroffer."
