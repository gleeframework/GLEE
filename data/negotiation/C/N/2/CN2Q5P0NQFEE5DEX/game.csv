"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While it's tempting, I'm hoping to pay a little less. How about $12,000? I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a great deal. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. It's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
