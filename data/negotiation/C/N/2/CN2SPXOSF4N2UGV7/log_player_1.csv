"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $175, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but not too high to scare Bob away.  I'm also emphasizing the product's value to encourage him to consider it.  This sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $150. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a large loss. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  This gives you a good price and still allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. How about we aim for $130? This would allow us to stay within my budget while providing a reasonable profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum desired price, $130 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again in the next round to try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. $130 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $135? This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, how about we settle on $125 for the product? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've been through several rounds of negotiation and it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  To avoid further delays and ensure I get the value I need, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
