"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $175, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  This gives you a good price and still allows me to make a fair profit.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. How about we aim for $130? This would allow us to stay within my budget while providing a reasonable profit for you.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. $130 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $135? This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away happy.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, how about we settle on $125 for the product? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",125.0,Bob,6,
