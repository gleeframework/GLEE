{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you still make a profit. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher starting price might scare Bob off immediately. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:** It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a huge loss. 
* **Is still above my minimum:** I'm still making a profit, even at this price. 
* **Is a reasonable compromise:** It demonstrates that I'm taking Bob's offer seriously and am willing to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted by Bob's offer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach a compromise:

* **It's a middle ground:** It splits the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer.
* **It's still above my minimum:** I'm still making a decent profit.
* **It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate:** I'm showing that I'm serious about closing this deal. 

Let's see if Bob finally accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,800 is still below my minimum price of $12,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. At this point, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000, as it's a guaranteed profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
