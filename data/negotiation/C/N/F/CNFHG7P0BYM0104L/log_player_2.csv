"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $1,400,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. 
* You have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000 as a backup, so you can safely negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1,300,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

* Accepting this offer saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John.
* While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'll end up having to buy from John at a higher price."
