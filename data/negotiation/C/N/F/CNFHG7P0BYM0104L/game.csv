"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1,300,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
