Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm not getting any younger, and I'd like to get a good price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","It seems like Alice is not budging much and is trying to push the price higher.  We're getting close to John's price. 

```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While it's not ideal to pay the full $150, it's better than risking Alice pushing the price even higher in the remaining rounds."
