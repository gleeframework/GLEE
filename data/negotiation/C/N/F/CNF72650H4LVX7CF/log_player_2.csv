"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many of our previous customers. Given its quality and functionality, it's worth $120 to you. I'm offering it to you at a special introductory price of $100. This is an excellent opportunity to get a great deal on a product that could significantly enhance your experience. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is lower than John's $120, it's still above your $120 maximum. You know you can get the product for $120 from John.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price further if you reject this initial offer."
