"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product.  While I'm aware I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price before I consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the compromise.  Would you consider $1,280,000? I think that's a very competitive offer and would allow us to close this out today.
