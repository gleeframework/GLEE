"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10200, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll sell the product to you for $10200, and I'll also include a complimentary service that's worth $800. So, the total value you'll get is $10200 + $800 = $10000 + $200 = $10200, but I'll call it $10200",10200.0,Alice,7,
