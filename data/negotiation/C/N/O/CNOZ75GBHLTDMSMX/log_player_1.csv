"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. I'm prepared to pay $9000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
