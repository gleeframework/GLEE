"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if a better price can be negotiated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a strong counteroffer:**  Bob is aiming to be aggressive but realistic. Offering $8,500 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, showing Bob's seriousness about saving money.
* **Be clear about your position:** The message emphasizes that this is Bob's ""best offer"" to establish a clear boundary.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  While $8,500 is close to Bob's limit, leaving some space for compromise could be beneficial in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than Alice's original offer, it's still above Bob's budget and John's price.  Bob should continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to his target. It's worth risking a few more rounds to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to push:** Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his limit, but he's showing flexibility by increasing his offer.
* **Staying firm but open to compromise:** The message emphasizes that this is a ""significant step up"" from his previous offer, but also leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Looking for common ground:** This phrase highlights a desire for a win-win situation, which could make Alice more receptive to finding a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The price is too high:** While $9,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his comfortable range. He's already been through multiple rounds of negotiation and hasn't been able to get a price that's ideal.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  Since John is willing to sell the product for $8,000, Bob is guaranteed to save money by buying from him.  The risk of continuing negotiations with Alice is that she might not come down to a price Bob is happy with.
* **The time constraint:**  The game has a limited number of rounds, and Bob doesn't want to waste time on a negotiation that might not lead to a favorable outcome.

It's more beneficial for Bob to secure a guaranteed good deal with John rather than risk further negotiations."
