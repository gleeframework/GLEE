"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is less than the product's worth to Alice, it's still more than your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's price, aiming for a large discount. This is a bold move, but it's important to show Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm not willing to pay close to her initial price.  We'll see how she reacts and if she's willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Alice down to a price that's more appealing. If she rejects again, I'll be happy to go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price, which is also John's price. If Alice rejects this offer, it means I can get the product for the same price from John. This is a win-win situation for me, as I'm not losing out on any potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not willing to budge much further. At this point, I can either take a small risk and make another counteroffer, hoping she'll accept, or just go with John's offer.  Since I'm already at my maximum budget, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down any further, I'm going to stick with John's offer and save myself some potential hassle."
