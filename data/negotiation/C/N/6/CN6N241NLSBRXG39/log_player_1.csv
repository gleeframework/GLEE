Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,100,000. I believe it presents significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, while still ensuring I'm well above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible price while acknowledging Bob's potential counter-offers and the fallback option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counter-offer indicates he's interested, and his initial offer being significantly lower than his perceived value suggests he might be willing to go higher. I'll counter-offer to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This would be a win-win, providing you with substantial value while reflecting the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, suggesting a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price point. 
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as mutually beneficial, emphasizing the value Bob gains while subtly reinforcing the product's worth.
* **Above Minimum, But Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm staying comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but leaving room for potential further negotiation with Bob before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This would allow me to get a good deal on the product while still being fair to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $950,000 is a strong offer, representing a significant profit above my minimum ($800,000).
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gains are becoming smaller and riskier. Bob might not move much further, and each round prolongs the negotiation. 
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting now guarantees a very good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation or selling to John at the lower price."
