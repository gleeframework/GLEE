"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $150, and Alice is offering the product for $150, there's no immediate advantage to accepting.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $120? "", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit tight for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $140, which is my lowest price for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $140, which is within Bob's budget. 
* Buying from Alice at $140 is still cheaper than buying from John at $150. 
* While there's still room for negotiation, accepting this offer minimizes risk and gets Bob the product for a lower price."
