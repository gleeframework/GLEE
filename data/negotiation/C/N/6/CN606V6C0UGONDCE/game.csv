"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $9,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is already below my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,5,
