"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. It's still a fair price for the product's value, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $775,000 just isn't enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $800,000? This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're still interested, let's close the deal. Otherwise, I'm going to have to move on to other potential buyers.",800000.0,Alice,5,
