"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than buying from John, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $1,100,000 is a substantial reduction from Alice's offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This price is still higher than the product's worth to Alice, giving her an incentive to negotiate.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This leaves room for several rounds of counteroffers before reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than the product's value to her.  There's a reasonable expectation that she'll be willing to negotiate further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a better price. Buying from John right now guarantees the product but at a higher cost. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome, closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Progress:**  Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by increasing his offer from the previous round. This demonstrates a genuine interest in reaching a deal.
* **Midpoint Approach:** The offer is a midpoint between Alice's latest offer and Bob's previous offer, suggesting a potential meeting point. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  The offer is still significantly lower than Alice's initial asking price, which puts pressure on her to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the Trend:** Alice's offer keeps lowering, but it's still more than the product's value to her. This suggests she's willing to negotiate further.
* **Staying Patient:**  Bob is in a strong position. He can still potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Minimizing Loss:**  Buying from John now would be a guaranteed deal, but it's the most expensive option. Continuing to negotiate gives Bob a chance to get a better price and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing the Waters:** This offer is almost at Alice's likely minimum price, testing her willingness to accept a deal close to her value. 
* **Potential for Agreement:** It's plausible that Alice might accept this offer, as it's close to what she likely wants to get. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can still choose to buy from John, but at least he's pushing for a price closer to his ideal."
