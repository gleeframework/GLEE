Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer the product to you for $9,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $9,000. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $8,000."
