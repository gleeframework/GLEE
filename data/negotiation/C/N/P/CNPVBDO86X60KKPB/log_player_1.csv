"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for Compromise:**  The offer is not too aggressive, allowing for potential counteroffers and a successful negotiation.
* **Plan B:** I'm aware of John's offer of $1,200,000, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While his offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob or John. 

By rejecting this offer, I maintain leverage and keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's still higher than his initial offer but closer to his perceived value, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value the product offers to Bob.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties, fostering a collaborative approach. 
* **Remaining Firm:** I'm not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable price point of $1,200,000. However, this counteroffer is a step closer to his offer, showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it still falls below my ideal target. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000, especially with John's offer of $1,200,000 as a fallback option. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm serious about achieving a price closer to my desired value. This will also incentivize Bob to potentially make a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $950,000 is a good price point for you. However, I need to ensure I get a fair return on the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,000,000. This would allow us to both benefit from this transaction.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's still higher than his offer but is now at my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I emphasize the importance of a fair return for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Focus on Agreement:** The message focuses on making the deal happen, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Remaining Firm:** I'm standing firm on my minimum acceptable price.  This counteroffer is a final compromise, leaving little room for further negotiation."
