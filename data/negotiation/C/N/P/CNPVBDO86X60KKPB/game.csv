"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $950,000 is a good price point for you. However, I need to ensure I get a fair return on the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,000,000. This would allow us to both benefit from this transaction.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
