"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer is still above your target of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to consider a price closer to $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant step towards your target price. It shows you're serious about buying the product but are also willing to walk away if the price isn't right. 
* **Justification:**  The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, making it seem more reasonable than a random number. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $10,500 leaves room for you to compromise if Alice counteroffers, potentially finding a price that works for both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  It's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit higher than your target price of $12,000. You have already shown your willingness to negotiate, and it seems like Alice is open to compromising. It's worth another round of negotiation to try and squeeze out a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,750? That's a fair compromise and would allow me to proceed with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small step:** This counteroffer is a smaller step than the previous one, showing that you're getting closer to a compromise.
* **Fairness:** Emphasizing ""fair compromise"" helps frame your counteroffer as a reasonable solution.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable and increases the likelihood of Alice accepting."
