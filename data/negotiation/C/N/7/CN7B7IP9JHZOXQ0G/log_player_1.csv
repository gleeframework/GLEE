Round 2
Bob's offer:

``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, I can still try to get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $115. Can you consider my previous offer of $110 again, or would you be willing to go a bit lower?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $110 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go down to $112, which is a fair compromise. This is the lowest I can go, so I hope you can consider it. "", ""product_price"": 112}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my comfort. I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to get a good deal with him, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's better to sell to John at this point and secure a guaranteed $120."
