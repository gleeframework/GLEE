"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. Can you consider this price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I can do $1300000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"
"I've taken your offer of $1100000 into consideration, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as I believe the product is worth at least this amount. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1200000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1150000. Can you consider this price?",1150000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand that you're still hesitant, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession by meeting you halfway at $1200000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm starting to think that you might be getting a good deal, and I'd rather explore other opportunities. I'm keeping the product on the market, and I'm open to other offers. You can think about it, but I'm not willing to budge from $1200000."
"I've decided to keep the product on the market, Bob. I'm still willing to sell it to you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000. If you're interested, I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not making any further concessions. If you're not interested, I'm happy to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,,
