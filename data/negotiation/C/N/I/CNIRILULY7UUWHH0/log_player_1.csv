Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could lead to greater profit.
* **Finding a Balance:**  We don't want to scare Bob off with a price too close to $12,000.  Offering it at $11,500 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **First Offer Advantage:** By presenting Bob with a strong initial offer, we set the tone for the negotiation and potentially secure a quick sale."
