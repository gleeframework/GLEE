"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I propose a starting price of $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product has some value, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,500,000. I'd like to meet in the middle and discuss further.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the true potential and worth of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but I think that's the maximum I can go. I'd like to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little under what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,250,000, which would be $1,150,000. I hope we can agree on this price.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
