Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product has some value, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,500,000. I'd like to meet in the middle and discuss further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the true potential and worth of this product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but I think that's the maximum I can go. I'd like to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

We're getting closer, but I'm still willing to hold out for a better offer from Bob before resorting to John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little under what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price that reflects the true value of this product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,250,000, which would be $1,150,000. I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could try to push for a little more, Bob is clearly getting closer to his maximum price. Accepting $1,150,000 is a good outcome and avoids the risk of him walking away completely."
