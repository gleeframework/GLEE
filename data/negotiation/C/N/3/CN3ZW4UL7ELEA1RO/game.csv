"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my target price as possible. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my value for it and leaves some room for you to still make a profit.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $950,000. This is a fair price that allows you to get closer to your target and me to acquire the product within my budget.  What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not quite there yet. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your offer, and I believe it's a price that still works for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your latest offer, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This is a fair price that leaves us both with a good deal. Let's finalize this agreement. ",975000.0,Bob,6,
