"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. This product comes with exceptional features that ensure high performance and reliability. Considering its quality and functionality, I believe it's worth more than its face value. For this opportunity, I am offering it to you for $120. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations or if you would like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  There's no guarantee Alice won't come down further in price, and you have 9 rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the quality of the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to go down to $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering our product, Bob. I understand your perspective and respect your budget constraints. In an effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am now offering the product for $110. This price reflects a compromise that considers both the value of the product and your comfort level with the cost. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations, and I look forward to your response.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $120 to $110. While I'd prefer to get it for $100, $110 is still a good deal compared to John's offer of $150. It's worth accepting before she potentially increases the price again."
