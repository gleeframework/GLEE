Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm aiming to gauge his interest and see how high he's willing to go."

{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above my minimum.  Hopefully, Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000.  While it's not my initial asking price, it's a decent profit, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. There's a chance Bob might not budge further, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
