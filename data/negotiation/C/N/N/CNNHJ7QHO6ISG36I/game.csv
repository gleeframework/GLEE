"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000.  This is a great deal for you, as you've already acknowledged it's worth $800000 to you.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1200000 is still a bit steep. I'd like to offer $1000000 for the product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1000000 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will be beneficial for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1050000. Can we compromise on that price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. Let's try one more compromise. I'm willing to drop to $1075000. This is a final offer from me, as I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1075000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can go up to $1025000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
