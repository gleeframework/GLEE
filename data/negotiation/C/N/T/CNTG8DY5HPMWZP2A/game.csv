"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to work with you on a fair price.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to recoup some of my initial investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  That's still a good deal for you, given the value you've placed on the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to recoup your investment, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm getting closer to your price point, but $1,250,000 still doesn't quite cover my costs. How about we split the difference at $1,275,000? This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident it's still a very good deal for you considering the product's value.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
