"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $850,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm prepared to pay $900,000.  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $925,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stand firm at $900,000. This is a fair price for a product we both value, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm at $900,000, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'll come down to $915,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",915000.0,Alice,7,
