I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm confident Bob will be interested since he values the product at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that still allows me to make a decent profit while giving Bob a better deal than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, $13,000 is a good deal considering Bob's previous rejections and the fact that I can sell to John for $12,000. It's a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the deal goes through."
