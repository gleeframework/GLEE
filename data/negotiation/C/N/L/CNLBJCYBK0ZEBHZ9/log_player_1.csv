I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still ensuring I get a good price. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, as I believe its worth much more than $1,000,000 to me. 

I'll be closely monitoring Bob's response and will adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise that's mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,400,000. This is a reasonable compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still valuing the product highly. I'm hopeful that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
