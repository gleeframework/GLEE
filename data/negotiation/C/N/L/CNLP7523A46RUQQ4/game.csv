"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,600,000 as a starting point for negotiation.  This represents a substantial investment on my part and is a good starting point for discussion.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for providing your perspective. While $1,600,000 is a significant investment, the true value of this product is considerably higher, as I'm sure you recognize.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $2,000,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and a compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, I can't accept anything less than $1,900,000. This slight concession on my part represents my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 remains a bit outside my budget. To finalize this deal, I'm prepared to offer $1,750,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Bob,6,
