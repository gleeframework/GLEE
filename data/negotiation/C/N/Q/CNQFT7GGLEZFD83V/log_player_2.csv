"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe the value is more than worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes sense to reject and start a counteroffer process to hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000, which still gives you a great deal.  Let's find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'll try to negotiate further to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway. While $900,000 is getting closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is within my budget and represents a good compromise.  While I'd prefer to pay less, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to secure the product now at a price that is still advantageous for me."
