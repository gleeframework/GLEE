# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm extending this opportunity to purchase it at a special introductory price of $120. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you is $100, and it's a chance to save compared to the full value. I look forward to hearing your decision soon! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

You should reject Alice's offer. Even though it's a ""special introductory price"", it's still more than you're willing to pay. You can get the same product from John for $100."
