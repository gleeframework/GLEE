Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose an offer of $105. This is a fair compromise between your original asking price and my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $105 is better than selling to John for $100, and it's within a reasonable range of my target price. I'll accept his offer."
