"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering my alternative options.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $1,300,000 is getting closer to where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,325,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
