"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's valuation:**  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate and potentially find a price that works for both of us.
* **Below your minimum:** This ensures you still get a good deal and leaves room for negotiation.

It's also a good idea to open with a friendly message to establish a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering my alternative options.  Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept a price that significantly undervalues my product.  

I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price slightly.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** My counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a compromise, offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above his valuation.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Going:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and gives Bob another opportunity to consider a price that might work for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,350,000 is still too high. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to an agreement. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product. 

I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a compromise that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $1,300,000 is getting closer to where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,325,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a clear commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Emphasis on Finality:** By mentioning ""finalizing the deal,"" I'm subtly putting pressure on Bob to accept this offer to avoid further negotiations.
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes that this price would be ""fair for both of us,"" making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to meeting your price, but $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000. This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product. 

I will reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and the possibility of selling to John, so I need to find a price that's closer to my desired range."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to an agreement, but $1,275,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would be a fair price considering the product's value and my need to reach a deal quickly. If we can agree on this, we can finalize the transaction.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, showing a commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Urgency:** I subtly emphasize the ""need to reach a deal quickly"" to put pressure on Bob.
* **Finality:** I mention ""finalizing the transaction"" to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

This counteroffer is a strategic move aimed at finding a middle ground while also putting the pressure on Bob to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,285,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,285,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the pressure is mounting. Bob's offer of $1,285,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,500,000, and I'm not sure I can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds. 

Given the time constraint and the potential of a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, it's in my best interest to stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John. This ensures I maximize my earnings and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
