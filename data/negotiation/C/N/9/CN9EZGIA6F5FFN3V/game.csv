"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's true worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering our respective needs.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering our individual needs.  If we can reach an agreement at this price, I'm ready to finalize the purchase.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
