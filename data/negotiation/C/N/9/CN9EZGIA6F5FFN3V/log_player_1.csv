"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and signals the product's value to you. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,300,000, we set a high anchor point, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value and his counteroffer. 
* **Leaving Room:**  This offer gives us ample space to negotiate downwards towards a mutually agreeable price that's still significantly above Bob's perceived value and our minimum.

**Important:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, it's strategically better to explore if we can get a higher price from Bob before settling for John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below both our minimum ($1,000,000) and the product's value to him ($800,000).  We have room to negotiate, and it's too early to accept an offer this low. We'll counter in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've lowered our price by $150,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Target:** This counteroffer keeps us well above both our minimum price and Bob's valuation, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price, subtly reminding Bob of its potential benefits. 

We aim to gradually close the gap with Bob, but we're also mindful that we have the option of John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering our respective needs.  Let's try to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, it's still below our $1,000,000 goal. We're only on round 4, and John's offer provides a safety net.  We'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Movement:** We've lowered our price by $75,000, signaling our strong desire to close the deal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer puts us just above our $1,000,000 target and allows for minor concessions if needed while still securing a favorable price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  We're halfway through the rounds, subtly introducing a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to agree to a price close to this offer. 

We're optimistic about reaching an agreement with Bob around this price point but are prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering our individual needs.  If we can reach an agreement at this price, I'm ready to finalize the purchase.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has reached our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. There's no strategic advantage to continuing negotiations, as:

* **Equal to John's Offer:**  Continuing carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through, leaving us with the same $1,000,000 from John. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainties associated with further negotiation rounds.

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees our minimum desired outcome and avoids unnecessary risks."
