"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $100 is too low for me, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."

I'm offering a slight compromise at $115. I'm hoping this is a sweet spot that Bob will find agreeable, while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
