"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",100.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $100. However, I am hoping to find a price closer to $80, which would be more in line with my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $95. This is still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. While $95 is a reasonable offer, I am still hoping to stay closer to my initial target of $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $85? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still trying to get as close to your target of $80 as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $92. This is still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. However, I am still aiming to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to agree on a price of $88? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",88.0,Bob,6,
