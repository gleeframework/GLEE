{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for a lower price than $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's value:** We know Alice values the product at $10,000. 
* **Your maximum:** You're willing to pay up to $15,000.
* **Negotiation:**  A counteroffer of $10,500 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her perceived value. This gives her room to negotiate while still saving you money."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:**  We know Alice values the product at $10,000.
* **Previous Offer:** Alice offered $11,800, showing she's willing to come down. 
* **Negotiation:** A counteroffer of $11,000 is a reasonable next step. It's higher than her perceived value but significantly lower than her last offer. This shows you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:**  $11,500 is a great price, significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While there's always potential to push for a lower price, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, considering she's already moved close to her perceived value. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to reject offers risks Alice getting impatient and sticking to a higher price, or even pulling out of the deal entirely.

Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
