Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price, considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to go much lower than $975,000. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk that Alice won't budge.  It's better to secure the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
