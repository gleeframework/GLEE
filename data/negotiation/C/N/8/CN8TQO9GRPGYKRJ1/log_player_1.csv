"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price, knowing that I can always come down. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and potentially reveal his perceived value of the product.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  $2,000,000 is a significant amount, but it leaves room for me to negotiate and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 

**Note:**  I'm aware that this strategy could lead to a failed negotiation with Bob. However, the risk is calculated because I have a backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my opening price, it's still above my minimum of $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate further. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's potential to get closer to my desired price, especially since Bob expressed interest in the product. 
* **Time to Counter:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**  I will counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer.  This will show flexibility while still aiming for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand your offer, but I'm still looking to get closer to my initial price. Would you be willing to pay $1,900,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Maintaining Value:** By dropping my price only $100,000, I am still maintaining a high value for the product.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping a positive and collaborative tone in my message, fostering a sense of partnership and encouraging Bob to reconsider.

**Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I will assess his potential for a counter-offer and determine if I should continue negotiating or move to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1900000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1800000 and $1900000, so how about $1850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $1,850,000 is exactly halfway between our previous offers, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Closing the Gap:** Accepting this offer will allow me to close the deal and get a good price for my product.
* **Time is Running Out:**  With 6 rounds remaining, it's getting late in the negotiation.  Accepting a slightly lower offer now is better than risking a breakdown and having to sell to John for less. 

**Next Steps:**  I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal.  This ensures I secure a significant profit while minimizing the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
