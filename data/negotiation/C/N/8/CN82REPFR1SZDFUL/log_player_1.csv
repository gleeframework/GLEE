Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $11,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500.  This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's still above my minimum threshold and hopefully appealing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is stubbornly low-balling me.  While I'd love to get more, I'm not going to risk losing a guaranteed $10,000 from John by continuing this negotiation.  Time to take the sure thing."
