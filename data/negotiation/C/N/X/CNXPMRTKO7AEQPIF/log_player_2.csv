"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this product, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high.  It's worth significantly less than your maximum budget, and you have the potential to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value, I'd like to offer you $750,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still within your budget and is closer to your desired price point. While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might not be willing to go lower, or you could spend too much time in the negotiation. Accepting her offer ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of losing it to another buyer or spending too long negotiating."
