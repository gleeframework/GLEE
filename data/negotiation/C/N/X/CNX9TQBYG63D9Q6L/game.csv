"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $8,500 is still a bit much. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $7,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $8,250 as a final compromise. This price still allows me to make a decent profit while offering you a fair deal.  Let's close this deal, what do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
