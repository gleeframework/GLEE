Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $95 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for a potential compromise without making a counteroffer feel too unreasonable. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, encouraging Bob to engage. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will assess his counteroffer and potentially adjust my price downwards. I will also consider the time spent in negotiation and the risk of losing John as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  While $85 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob is already showing interest, and I believe there's room for negotiation. 
* **Risk of John:** While $100 from John is a safe option, I'm willing to risk losing John for the chance to get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, potentially meeting him halfway at $90. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for you. How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Meeting Bob halfway at $90 shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Positive and Direct:** The message is clear and concise, emphasizing the value proposition for Bob. 
* **Urgency:**  The ""split the difference"" approach subtly encourages Bob to close the deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've achieved a good price. If he rejects, I will re-evaluate my options, considering the time invested and the potential risk of losing John as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $85. Would you be willing to meet me at $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While $87.50 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Time and Risk:**  Negotiating with Bob is becoming time-consuming, and the risk of losing John as a buyer is increasing.
* **Potential for Better Outcome:** There's still a chance to get closer to my target price, but I need to be more assertive in my next counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, potentially offering a price slightly higher than $87.50.  If he rejects this offer, I will accept John's offer of $100 to avoid further delays and minimize risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a little more to $89.  This is my final offer. If you're interested, let's finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 89}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer clearly communicates that I'm nearing the end of my negotiation flexibility.
* **Slight Concession:**  Offering $89 is a small concession but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the potential loss of the deal and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this final offer, I will immediately accept John's offer of $100 to avoid further delay and potential loss of revenue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable going above $85. Would you be willing to meet me at $86? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Money:**  Negotiating with Bob has taken several rounds, and there's no guarantee of reaching a mutually acceptable price.
* **Risk of Further Delay:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John as a buyer, which would result in a missed opportunity for a guaranteed $100 sale.
* **Minimum Price:** Bob's final offer of $86 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.

**Next Steps:**

I will immediately accept John's offer of $100 to secure the sale and maximize my profit. While I'm disappointed to not close the deal with Bob at a higher price, the potential delay and risk of losing John outweigh the potential for a slightly higher price from Bob."
