"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's split the difference and meet at $11,000.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $11,750. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here. $11,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we try $11,250?  That's a fair compromise and keeps us both in the middle ground.",11250.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make another small concession and offer it to you for $11,900. What do you think?",11900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to see eye-to-eye on this price. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  That's my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $11,500, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,700. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11700.0,Alice,9,
