"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation while still being close to my minimum price. I'm aiming to get as close to $12,000 as possible without pushing him away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price and leaves little room for me to profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price for this valuable product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 
 
I'm offering $11,000, which is a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be appealing to Bob while still being close to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with $10,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price.  I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 still isn't quite right for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's in our best interests to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm offering $10,750, a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still a substantial discount from my initial asking price. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while still being within my minimum price range. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to find a solution soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. I would like to counter with $10,600 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,600 is closer to my desired price than previous offers, it's still significantly lower than what I'd prefer.  I'm willing to try one more round of negotiation to see if I can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,600 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to make a final concession and go down to $10,800. This is a fair price, and I really want to make this deal work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

I'm offering $10,800, which is only $200 more than Bob's last offer. This shows my commitment to finding a solution, but I'm also running out of time. I hope this is appealing enough to Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your last offer, but I can only pay $10,700 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting very close to my minimum, but I'm running out of time.  I'm worried that if I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I might lose the opportunity to sell to John altogether.  It's better to secure the $12,000 deal now and move on."
