Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $150. I think you'll find it's a steal at this rate."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is already trying to push me to my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely further negotiation will get me significantly more, so I'll take the guaranteed $120 from John."
