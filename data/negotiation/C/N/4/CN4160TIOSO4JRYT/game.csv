"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and highly valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. This price reflects a compromise that allows me to consider the purchase while staying within my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This price still represents a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's closer to my target. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. This price is at the upper limit of what I am comfortable spending, and I hope it aligns more closely with your valuation of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet your offer of $1000000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1050000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 5-year warranty, which will add significant value to the product. Is this a deal you'd be willing to accept?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my budgetary constraints, Alice. While I appreciate the additional value you're offering, I must stick to my financial limits. I am willing to pay up to $1000000 for the product. This price includes all the extras you've mentioned, as well as the product itself. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
