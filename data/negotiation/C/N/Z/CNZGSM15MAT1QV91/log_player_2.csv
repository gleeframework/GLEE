"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a deal to get it into your hands. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately, $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum budget as possible while still leaving room for negotiation.  Offering $12,500 is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still leaves some wiggle room for Alice to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further.  $12,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm prepared to come down a little. How about $13,500?  That's a fair compromise and still allows me to get a decent price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is closer to his budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his maximum of $12,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  He's already shown a willingness to pay more than his maximum with his previous counteroffer, so there's room for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $13,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $13,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a good price for the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to reach a compromise with Alice.  He's moved up from his initial counteroffer of $12,500, demonstrating his genuine interest in the product.  Offering $13,000 is a reasonable middle ground between his maximum budget and Alice's latest offer.  This shows a willingness to meet halfway, which might encourage Alice to accept the deal."
