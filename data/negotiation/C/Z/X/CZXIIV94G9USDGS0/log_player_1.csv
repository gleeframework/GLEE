Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. Given my maximum is $800,000, I'm willing to start negotiations with a counteroffer of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  I'm hopeful we can find a mutually acceptable solution.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing at a slow rate. It's unlikely he'll reach a price close enough to your $1,500,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees you the best possible outcome at this point."
