,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. Given my maximum is $800,000, I'm willing to start negotiations with a counteroffer of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, my absolute lowest price for this product is $1,700,000.  I believe this still reflects a fair deal considering its potential.  What are your thoughts?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and would like to close this with you. My final offer is $1,550,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my best and final price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the effort you've made to close the deal. However, $1,550,000 is still above my budget.  To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  I'm hopeful we can find a mutually acceptable solution.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
