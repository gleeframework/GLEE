"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and potential impact on your operations, I propose a special introductory price of $12,000 for you. This is a unique opportunity to secure a high-quality asset at an attractive rate. I look forward to hearing your decision soon. Best regards, Alice. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still higher than the $10,000 you can get it for from John. You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with your alternative option."
