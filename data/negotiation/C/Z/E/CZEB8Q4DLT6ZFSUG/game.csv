"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to offer it to you at a price of $800,000. I believe this is a great deal considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product, given its value to me and your desired price. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Given its value to me and your desired price, I believe a price of $900,000 would be fair and allow us to both walk away happy. Let's see if we can bridge this gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
