"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to offer it to you at a price of $800,000. I believe this is a great deal considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if we can get a better price before resorting to John's offer of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product, given its value to me and your desired price. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I believe I can still get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Given its value to me and your desired price, I believe a price of $900,000 would be fair and allow us to both walk away happy. Let's see if we can bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer significantly.  While $1,050,000 is still more than I'd ideally pay, it's a much better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000.  It's worth accepting this offer to secure the product and avoid further negotiations."
