"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,375,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $1,375,000 is still far below the value I place on this product. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,562,500. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What's your decision?",1562500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,562,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000. I'll offer $1,450,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
