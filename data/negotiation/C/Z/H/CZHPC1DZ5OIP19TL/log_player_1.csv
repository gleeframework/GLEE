"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. Given your potential return on investment, I believe this is a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for negotiation and counteroffers, showing Bob we're willing to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Confident but Not Aggressive:** The tone is confident in the product's value but avoids an overly aggressive initial stance that might alienate Bob.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's eagerness:** A quick acceptance indicates we might have been able to start even higher.
2. **Set a strong anchor:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets a high reference point for subsequent negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $900,000.  Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both our initial offer and Bob's perceived value of the product. We have room to negotiate and aim for a better outcome. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, we signal that we're serious about finding a price that reflects the product's true worth while remaining open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant step down from my initial proposal. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,030,000? This recognizes the product's value while offering you a more agreeable price."", 
""product_price"": 1030000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial offer ($1,100,000) to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Target:** However, the counteroffer remains firmly above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justifying the Price:**  The message reiterates the product's value, anchoring our counteroffer in logic and encouraging Bob to meet us closer to the middle ground. 

This approach aims to:

1. **Encourage movement from Bob:**  By making a substantial concession, we hope to incentivize Bob to increase his offer significantly in the next round.
2. **Maintain a strong position:** We're not giving up too much ground and are still in a good position to secure a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and land at $965,000? I think that's a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $965,000 is tempting, we're still early in the negotiation, and Bob is consistently moving towards our desired price point. This indicates he's willing to pay more. Rejecting this offer encourages him to make another, hopefully closer to our ideal outcome.  We're confident we can still secure a better deal without risking losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, finding a fair compromise is key here. While I see the logic in your proposal,  $965,000 undervalues some key benefits this product offers.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. This feels like a very reasonable price considering the value you're gaining."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, But Holding Strong:**  We are making a smaller concession this time ($30,000), signaling that we're nearing our desired price point.
* **Psychological Price Point:** Offering $1,000,000 creates a strong psychological anchor. It's a clean, round number that might be more appealing to Bob.
* **Emphasis on Value:** We're reiterating the product's value and framing the price reduction as a significant concession to keep the negotiation moving positively. 

This approach aims to:

1. **Encourage Bob's final offer:**  By reducing our ask to a psychologically appealing number, we're hoping to prompt Bob to make his final, best offer.
2. **Maintain a profitable position:** We're still well above our minimum, ensuring a profitable deal if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been great to negotiate with and I respect your position on the product's value.  To be frank, my absolute limit is $980,000. If you can make that work, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $980,000 is a strong offer, exceeding our minimum price by $180,000.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob has indicated this is his absolute limit, creating urgency and suggesting he might not be willing to negotiate further.
* **Time Value of Money:** Accepting now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation and guarantees a significant profit. While we might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the potential gain is likely outweighed by the risk of Bob walking away. 

This is a good deal that meets our goals. It's time to close the sale."
