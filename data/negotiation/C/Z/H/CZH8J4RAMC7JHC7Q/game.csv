"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $8,500 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still a bit outside of what I can afford right now.  I'm really interested in this product and I think $9,500 is a fair compromise. This would give us both a decent deal, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
