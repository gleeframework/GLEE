Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $120 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, demanding a price too close to $120 might discourage Bob immediately. This approach balances profit with the chance of a quick sale."
