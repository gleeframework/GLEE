Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To better accommodate your budget while still ensuring fair compensation, I would like to propose an adjusted price of $90 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has lowered her price to $90. This is still a good deal for you, as you are willing to pay up to $100. It's better than buying from John and it's more than what you were initially offering. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product and save some money."
