"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I believe will be highly beneficial to you.  My asking price is $1,000,000, which I believe represents a fair value considering the product's worth to you.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision as soon as possible.  If you choose not to proceed, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a lower price."
