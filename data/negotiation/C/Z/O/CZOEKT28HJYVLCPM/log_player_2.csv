"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be extremely valuable to you. While I can't divulge details about the product's specific benefits, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to let you have it for $1500000.  This is a price point that allows for significant upside potential for you, while still being fair for me. Consider this a chance to acquire something truly special.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.
* However, there is no clear indication that the product is actually worth more than $1,500,000 to me.
* Since I can buy the product from John for the same price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and go with John. This way, I'm not taking a risk of overpaying for something that might not be worth it."
