"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. It's a great product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1200000 just isn't feasible for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This is a great deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1200000. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm still a bit higher than $1250000.  How about we meet in the middle again at $1275000? This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to stay within your budget and me to get a price closer to my value.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $1225000.  Let's split the difference one last time. How about $1250000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a deal we can both agree on.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in buying the product from you, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1250000. How about we meet at $1220000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise.",1220000.0,Bob,8,
