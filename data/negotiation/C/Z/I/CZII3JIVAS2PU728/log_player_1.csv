This offer is a starting point. It's a significant discount from your minimum value, making it appealing to Bob.  By starting high, you leave room for negotiation while still securing a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am proposing to purchase the product for $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal target.  I'm confident that I can push for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose purchasing the product for $1,060,000. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,075,000 at this point. I'll continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,060,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,065,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1065000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to compromise, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. Based on my financial considerations, I would like to propose purchasing the product for $1,062,500. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations have reached a point where further concessions from Bob are unlikely. While $1,062,500 is a respectable offer, it is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Instead of risking further rounds of negotiations with Bob, I'm going to take John's offer and sell the product for $1,200,000. This ensures a secure profit and avoids the risk of a stalemate with Bob."
