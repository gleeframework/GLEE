Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and avoids immediately shutting down the conversation.
* **Potential for counteroffers:**  A price of $12,000 allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without me having to immediately accept a significantly lower price.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I have John as a buyer willing to pay $15,000 provides me with a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is lower, there's still a chance I can push him closer to my desired price range with a counteroffer.
* **John's offer provides leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 allows me to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating without being forced to settle for a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,500.  This price still gives you a great value on the product, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm making a slight compromise by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,500. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Finding a middle ground:** $11,500 is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Reiterate the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a slightly higher price.
* **Keep John in mind:**  I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price and keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to counter with an offer of $11,200 for the product. I hope this proposal will be more suitable for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $11,200 is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit below my acceptable range.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing time and potentially ending up with a price I'm not happy with.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed deal:** John's offer of $15,000 is a sure thing. It's a significantly better deal than Bob's current offer.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John minimizes risk and guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal with Bob. 

By selling to John, I secure a profitable sale and avoid the potential for further negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
