"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose specifics without a confidentiality agreement, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While she claims the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to her, this doesn't necessarily reflect its true market value.  It's always better to negotiate or look for a better deal.  Since John is offering the product for your maximum budget, it's a safer option."
