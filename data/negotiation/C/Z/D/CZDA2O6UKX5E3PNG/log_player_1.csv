Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This allows for room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price.  I'm hoping Bob will see value in the product and be willing to pay something closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $150 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm going to counter with $165. This is still a decent profit for me, and it's a more reasonable compromise than Bob's offer. I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $145 is still a good deal for me, exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $120. Further negotiation might yield a better price, but the risk of Bob backing out entirely or me having to settle for John's $120 offer is too high. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a good profit."
