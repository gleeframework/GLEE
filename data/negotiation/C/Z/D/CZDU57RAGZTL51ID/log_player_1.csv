Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and positive message is crucial to establish rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the product's potential value to Bob, even without knowing his specific needs.

This approach aims to start the negotiation process on a positive note and leaves space for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Minimum:** Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Room for Improvement:** There's no reason to believe I can get a better offer from Bob, and I'm risking losing the sale if I reject him.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing time and the opportunity to sell to another buyer.

While it's tempting to try for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum desired value, ensuring I don't lose out on a valuable opportunity."
