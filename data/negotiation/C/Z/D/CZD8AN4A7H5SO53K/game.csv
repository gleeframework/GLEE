"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum asking price.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $10000. It's still a good deal for both of us, as it's within my budget and leaves you with a decent profit. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 is just a little too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11000? That leaves us both with a good deal, and I believe it's still within your budget.  Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,
