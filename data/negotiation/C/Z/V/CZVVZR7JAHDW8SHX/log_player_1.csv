Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $19,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $10,000, but that doesn't directly dictate your asking price. 
* **Your Minimum:** Your absolute floor is $15,000 (John's guaranteed offer).
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a higher offer ($19,000) gives you room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to ""reluctantly"" come down while still exceeding your minimum. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a possibility Bob values the product more than $10,000 but is keeping that information private. A higher initial offer explores this possibility.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't have ethical concerns about potentially overcharging Bob. In real-world scenarios, fairness and transparency are crucial for building lasting business relationships."
