"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for the first time. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's always worth exploring if you can get a better price. You're not losing anything by rejecting the offer and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you letting me know about this product.  While I'm interested, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counteroffer:** Starting with a lower offer is common in negotiations, especially when you have a clear budget in mind. A $20 drop shows you're serious about buying but also trying to get a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  Keeping a friendly tone helps maintain a good rapport with Alice, even when making a counteroffer. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** This encourages Alice to consider your offer and potentially engage in further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $110 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Alice's offer is a good compromise, splitting the difference between your initial offer and her original price. 
* **Within Budget:**  $110 is still within your budget of $120.
* **Potential for More Savings:** While you could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk Alice might reject further negotiation. It's a good opportunity to secure a decent deal."
