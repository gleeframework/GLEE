Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $12,000. I know it's valuable and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $8,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for profit:**  A $12,000 offer has the potential to earn you a $4,000 profit.
* **Backup option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out as John guarantees the $8,000 baseline.
* **Confident tone:** The message aims for a confident yet open tone, suggesting the product's value justifies the price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging you have other options if Bob declines."
