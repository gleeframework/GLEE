"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, but also wants to avoid going too low and risking Alice walking away.  A counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her valuation, making it reasonable. This gives Alice room to bargain while also making clear Bob's intent to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is still within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  Alice is clearly unwilling to budge significantly, but Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still rounds left to try to reach a more agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below Alice's current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also pushing for a price closer to his target. 

Bob is also trying to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise. If Alice rejects this offer again, Bob will need to consider whether to increase his offer further or start exploring the option of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to Bob's desired price, the offer is still too high.  Bob has already made several counteroffers and is showing a willingness to negotiate.  There's still room for Alice to lower her price, and Bob should continue trying to secure a more favorable deal. The option of buying from John is always available, but Bob should exhaust all options with Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but this time it's a significant jump to $1,100,000. This shows that Bob is serious about closing the deal and is willing to meet Alice halfway. It's also close to his own maximum price, so there's limited room for further negotiation.  

With only four rounds left, Bob is taking a risk by making a larger jump.  If Alice accepts, he'll secure the product at a price he's comfortable with. If she rejects, Bob will need to decide whether to make a final counteroffer or go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly the same as John's price, making it a no-win situation for Bob.  There are only three rounds left, and with Alice seemingly unwilling to budge any further,  it's not worth risking losing the deal completely.

It's time to cut his losses and buy from John. While it doesn't save Bob any money, it guarantees him the product within his budget."
