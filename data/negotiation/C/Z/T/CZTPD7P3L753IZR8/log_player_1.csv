Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's maximum might leave room for him to counter-offer, potentially landing on a price higher than $120.
* **Time Value:** While we have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even with a slightly lower profit.

This strategy aims to balance profit maximization with the probability of a successful sale to Bob."
