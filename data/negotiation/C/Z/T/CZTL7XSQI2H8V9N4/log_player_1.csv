{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to see if I can increase the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$80 is far too low for me.  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a profit. I hope this will be more appealing to Bob while still remaining above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$90 is still too low for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one more time to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate and meet him halfway.  If this fails, I'll have to consider selling to John for $120."
