"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $650,000?  I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",650000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $650,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $800,000. This is my final offer before considering other options.",800000.0,Alice,3,,
