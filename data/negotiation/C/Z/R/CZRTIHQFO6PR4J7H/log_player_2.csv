"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I will reject Alice's offer because the product is too expensive for me. I can get the same product from John for $80, which is a much better deal.
