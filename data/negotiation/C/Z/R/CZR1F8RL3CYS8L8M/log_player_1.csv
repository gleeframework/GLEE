Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting Bob's current offer means leaving $100,000 on the table. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations for a potentially small gain.  Selling to John guarantees the $1,000,000 and avoids further negotiation."
