Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a high offer to see where Bob stands. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 2,000,000}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see what he has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price. Since I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,500,000, I'll choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll sell the product to Bob for $1,500,000."
