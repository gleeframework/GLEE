Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $19,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Gauging Interest:** The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest and encourage a counter-offer. By saying ""starting price,"" you signal some flexibility. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so there's no pressure to accept an offer below that.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower your price, but remain firm on not going below your minimum of $15,000."
