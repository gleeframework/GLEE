"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're close to your target, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,100? That's a fair deal for both of us.",7100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference was a good idea. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,100. I'm willing to meet you at $7,300, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7300.0,Alice,7,
