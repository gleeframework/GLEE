"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is well above his budget of $800,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm really interested in the product, though.  Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's budget than the initial offer, it's still above his preferred maximum. He should continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to pay a fair price. How about $950,000?  That's still a good profit for you, and it's within my budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're serious about the product, I think this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is tempting, Bob is still a bit above his budget and should continue negotiating.  He could try a counteroffer slightly lower than $975,000 to see if Alice will budge.  There are still a few rounds left, so he has time to try and get the price down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to work with me, and I think we're very close.  $975,000 is still a bit out of my price range, though.  Would you be willing to come down to $950,000? I believe this is still a good price for you, and it's the maximum I can afford."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think we've been over this price already. I'm not willing to go back to $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $950,000, which is $962,500. This is my final offer, and I expect you to take it or walk away. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has tried to negotiate with Alice, but she's not budging from her price. He's already at his limit for what he wants to pay, and there's a risk of continuing to negotiate will lead to more rounds and a higher price. Buying from John is the best option at this point to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
