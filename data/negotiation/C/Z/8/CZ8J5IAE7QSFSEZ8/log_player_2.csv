"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $800,000?"",

}
``` 
 
Reasoning:

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone throughout the negotiation is important for a successful outcome. 
* **Justification:** While not strictly necessary, hinting at a budget constraint can sometimes make your offer seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
