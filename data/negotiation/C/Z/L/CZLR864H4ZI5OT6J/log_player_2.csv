"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While the product is worth $150 to you, Alice's offer of $120 leaves little room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  You have 10 rounds, and Alice's initial offer is not very appealing. There's potential for you to negotiate a lower price.

**Next steps:** You'll need to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  I'm offering $105, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Show willingness to compromise:** My message emphasizes that I'm interested in buying the product but need a better price. 
* **Set the stage for further negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for continued dialogue and the potential for finding a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While Alice has lowered the price from $120 to $125, it's still above your desired price point.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** You have 7 rounds remaining, and there's still room for you to negotiate a lower price.
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:** Accepting Alice's offer now would mean paying more than you'd like. It's better to continue negotiating and see if you can get a better deal.

**Next steps:**  You'll need to make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $115. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll enjoy the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to compromise:**  This counteroffer shows that you're willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.  
* **Reasonable offer:** $115 is a significant drop from Alice's offer of $125 and puts you closer to your desired price. 
* **Positive message:** Emphasizing fairness and confidence in the product helps maintain a positive relationship while pushing for a better price.

**Next steps:** This offer puts you in a good position to potentially reach an agreement in the next few rounds. You can adjust your counteroffers based on Alice's responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $130. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I think you'll really enjoy the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $130 is still above your target. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  You have 5 rounds left and can likely negotiate a lower price. 
* **No need to rush:**  Buying from Alice now would mean spending more than you'd like, and you're not in a time crunch.

**Next steps:** You'll need to make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to your target. You could try offering $120 or even $125, depending on how willing you are to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  It's the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer at that price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair offer:** This counteroffer shows that you're serious about getting the product but won't overpay. It also demonstrates your willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on a ""fair"" price:** Emphasizing fairness helps to make the offer more appealing to Alice.
* **Highlight the benefits for Alice:** Mentioning that you're confident Alice will find another buyer at that price can encourage her to accept.

**Next steps:**  If Alice rejects this offer, you can try offering $125 in the next round, or consider buying the product from John if you feel you've done enough negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit of a compromise, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $125. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** Alice has stubbornly stuck at $125, which is above your desired price point. You've already shown your willingness to compromise, and it's unlikely she will budge further.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** You only have 3 rounds left. While you could try to negotiate further, the chances of reaching a satisfactory price within this time are slim.
* **Consider the alternative:**  Buying from John for $150 is still a better option than accepting Alice's offer at $125.

**Next steps:** You will need to make a final counteroffer in the next round.  If Alice rejects it, you'll be forced to choose between accepting her offer or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $125 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time and offer $122. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 122}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This counteroffer clearly signals that you're reaching your limit. 
* **Small compromise:**  Offering $122 shows you're willing to negotiate a bit further but are standing firm on your price.
* **Threat of walking away:**  Mentioning that you'll consider other options adds pressure to Alice and encourages her to reconsider.

**Next steps:** This is your final counteroffer. If Alice rejects it, you'll have to decide between accepting her final offer or buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $122 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to accept it. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $128. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has made a concession, $128 is still above your target price.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** You only have one round left. 
* **Better alternative:** Buying from John for $150 is a better deal than accepting Alice's offer at $128. 

**Conclusion:**  You've reached the end of your negotiation with Alice. Despite your efforts, you weren't able to secure a price that meets your desired target.  It's time to move on to John, who offers a fair price within your budget."
