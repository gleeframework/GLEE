"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price point.  There's no harm in trying to negotiate a lower price. Even if Alice rejects your counteroffer, you can always go to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $15,000 to $13,500. That's a decent discount but still within my budget.  It's worth pushing for a bit more to see if I can get it lower. If she rejects my counteroffer again, I'll still have the option to go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $13,000? I think this is a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product to you for $14000. It's a great value, and I think you'll really benefit from it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $14,000. While I'd prefer to go even lower, this is getting close to my limit.  Considering I can buy the product from John for $15,000, accepting this offer saves me $1,000. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product by pushing for a lower price."
