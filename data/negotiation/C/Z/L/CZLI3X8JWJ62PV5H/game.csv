"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  $100 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $75. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your interest, $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $85 is closer, I'm still looking to get it for a bit less.  I'm ready to offer $80.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",80.0,Bob,4,
