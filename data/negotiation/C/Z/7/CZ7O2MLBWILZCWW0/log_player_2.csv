Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite low for the value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  $11,500 is still a significant way off from what I had in mind, but I'm willing to go down to $15,000. This is my final offer, as this is the absolute lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer and the lowest she'll go.  Since her final price of $15,000 is still higher than John's guaranteed price of $12,000, it's in Bob's best interest to cut his losses and go with the sure thing."
