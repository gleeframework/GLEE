"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $7,500.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it gives me some room to work with.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
