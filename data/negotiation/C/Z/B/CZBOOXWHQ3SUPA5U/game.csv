"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $16,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $14,500. Let me know if that works for you.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay at $13,000.  If you're willing to budge to that, I'd be happy to buy the product from you.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already discounted the price by $2,500 from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let me know.",14000.0,Alice,5,
