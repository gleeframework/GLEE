Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I understand its value, my budget allows me to offer $1,000,000 for the product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I still feel that $1,000,000 is the most I can realistically offer. Let's aim for a compromise at $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly coming up in price, indicating he's willing to negotiate.  We're getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not there yet. It's worth seeing if I can push him a bit further before accepting or going to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $1,450,000? This reflects both the product's value and your budget considerations."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in finding a middle ground, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While he might go a little higher, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, securing the guaranteed $1,500,000."
