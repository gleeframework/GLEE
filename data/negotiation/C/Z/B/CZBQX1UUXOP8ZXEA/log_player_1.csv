"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe a good strategy is to start high and gradually lower the price, hoping to maximize my profits.  I'll be keeping a close eye on Bob's responses and John's offer to make the best possible deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price. I'll use the remaining rounds to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable value, and it's also the price John is willing to pay. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for anything less than what I consider fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, even though it's closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I have 6 rounds left and John is still a viable option, so I have room to negotiate without settling too low. I'm hopeful that I can reach a price that is closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,400,000.  This is a compromise, but it's still within my minimum acceptable range. It shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible and reach an agreement, but I'm not going to undervalue my product.  I'm hoping that with a few more rounds, we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not quite there.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to squeeze out a little more in the next few rounds. With only four rounds remaining, I'm starting to feel the pressure to close a deal. However, I believe that I can get closer to my target price, so I'm going to push for a bit longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to lower my price one last time to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, but it's still within my minimum acceptable range. With only three rounds left, I need to make a decision. I believe that Bob might be willing to accept this offer, but if he doesn't, I'll be forced to either settle for his offer or sell to John."
