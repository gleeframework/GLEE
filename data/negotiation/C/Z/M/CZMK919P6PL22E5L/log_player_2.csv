Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer and sell the product to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $125. You've reached your maximum budget and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $120 price."
