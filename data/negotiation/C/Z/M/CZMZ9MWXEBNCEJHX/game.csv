"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $140. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $150, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is your absolute limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $155. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",155.0,Alice,5,
