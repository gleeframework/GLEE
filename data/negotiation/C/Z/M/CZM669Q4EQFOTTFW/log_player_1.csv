"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significant and $1,200,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1350000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still early in the negotiation. Holding firm and countering again keeps the door open for a better offer, potentially closer to $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, I was hoping for a figure closer to my previous offer.  I'm willing to accept $1,300,000, but I can't go any lower than that."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to a price point where walking away and selling to John starts to become a real option.  By stating a firm bottom line, we're hoping Bob meets us at that middle ground. This approach balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,275,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope you can work with me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly committed to the negotiation, as he continues to make incremental increases in his offers. While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the difference is becoming smaller and the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting $1,275,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of continuing the negotiation."
