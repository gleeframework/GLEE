"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significant and $1,200,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, I was hoping for a figure closer to my previous offer.  I'm willing to accept $1,300,000, but I can't go any lower than that.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,275,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope you can work with me.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
