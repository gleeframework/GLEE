"Hey Alice, that's a bit steep for me.  I'm only willing to go up to $85 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $85 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a steal for the value you're getting.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still too high for me.  I'm comfortable at $95.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need a price that works for me too. How about we split the difference and settle at $105? This is my final offer.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to get this product, but $105 is still more than I'm willing to spend.  Let's do $100.  That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,
