"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $18000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $15000?  I'm willing to close the deal quickly at that price.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16500, which is a good compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal!",16500.0,Alice,3,
