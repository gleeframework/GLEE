"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.  I'm confident I can get at least $100 from John, so I'm not afraid to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a decent offer, I'm still confident I can get closer to my minimum target of $100.  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with my counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired target.  I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider while also leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is close to Bob's perceived value, I'm still hoping to close the deal for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to stick with my previous counteroffer of $90. Since Bob has shown some willingness to move up in price, I think this is a fair offer that might be enough to entice him. If he rejects again, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, it's unlikely I can convince Bob to go higher.  The risk of further negotiation is too high, and I'm guaranteed $100 by selling to John.  I'm confident this is the best decision to maximize my profits."
