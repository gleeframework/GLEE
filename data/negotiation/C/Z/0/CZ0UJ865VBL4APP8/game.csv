"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've had other interested buyers, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $110 for the product. Is that something you'd be interested in?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you've received a competing offer, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I can do $108 for the product. It's my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",108.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $108, Bob. At this point, I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying the product. I'm going to make one last offer, and if you don't accept, I'll have to consider other options. I'll meet you at $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer.",105.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, thank you for your persistence. I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. However, I must adhere to my decision. I am unable to match $105, and I will proceed with purchasing the product from John for $100.",100.0,Bob,10,
