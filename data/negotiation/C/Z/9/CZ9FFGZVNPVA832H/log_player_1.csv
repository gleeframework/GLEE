"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $70 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, Alice, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $78 is close to John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $82.  This is still well within the value of the product for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
