Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $12,000, which reflects its worth in the current market."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Starting with a higher offer ($12,000) leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John as a backup buyer gives you leverage. You don't have to desperately lowball the price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between:

* **Greed:**  Trying to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation as possible.
* **Risk Aversion:** Not pricing so high that Bob rejects the offer outright."
