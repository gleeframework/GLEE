"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $900,000 to you, as it's a fair compromise between our respective valuations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $900,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000 minus the potential savings. 
* By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or proceed to buy from John for $1,000,000. 
* There's room for negotiation before resorting to John's offer."
