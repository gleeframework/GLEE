"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I recognize the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,300,000. This would still represent a great deal for you, and it would allow me to achieve a more reasonable price. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

This price reflects the value you place on the product while allowing me to achieve a reasonable return. If this doesn't work for you, I may need to explore other options, as I'm sure you understand.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
