"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's value for the product, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth attempting to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can reach a price closer to your $1,000,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above your maximum budget. While you could continue to negotiate, the risk of Alice's counteroffers going even higher exists.  At this point, it's more prudent to go with John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 and avoid any further potential for increased costs."
