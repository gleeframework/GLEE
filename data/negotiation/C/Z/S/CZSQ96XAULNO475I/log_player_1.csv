"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value. However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This would still represent a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
