Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain from it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value is higher than Bob's perceived $10,000.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  The $19,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still significantly above your minimum.
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and open tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get a great deal at $19,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to decrease the price, potentially settling somewhere between $15,000 and $19,000. 
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John at your guaranteed $15,000. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to purchase the product."
