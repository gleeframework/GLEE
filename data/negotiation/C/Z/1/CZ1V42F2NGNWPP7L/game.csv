"Hi Alice,  $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still leaves room for you to profit from this purchase. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my initial offer. $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to find common ground here.  ",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $887,500. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
