"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this work.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still not quite there at $13,750.  Would you be willing to go to $14,500?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we can close the deal.  What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's meet at $14,250. This would be a good compromise and we can finally finalize the sale. What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,7,
