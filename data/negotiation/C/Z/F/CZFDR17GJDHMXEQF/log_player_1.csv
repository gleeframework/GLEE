"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range.  Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I want. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still not quite there at $13,750.  Would you be willing to go to $14,500?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we can close the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close. How about $14,000 and we shake on it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is getting closer to my target price, I believe I can still squeeze a bit more out of this negotiation.  There are still four rounds left, and I'm determined to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's meet at $14,250. This would be a good compromise and we can finally finalize the sale. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm running out of time here.  My final offer is $14,100.  If you don't accept, I'll have to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call, but with only two rounds left, I need to make a decision. While $14,100 is not my ideal price, it's only $900 less than my last offer, and I'm running the risk of losing out on the deal completely if I reject Bob's offer.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
