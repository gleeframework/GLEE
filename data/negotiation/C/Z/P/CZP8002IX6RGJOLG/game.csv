"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $120 for this fantastic product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $120 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind.  Could we settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $75 is just not feasible for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  This is a great price for such a valuable product.",100.0,Alice,5,
