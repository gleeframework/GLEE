"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'll see if Bob bites, or if he makes a counteroffer.  If he doesn't, I have John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is better than $800,000, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to be a little stubborn."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I think this price is reasonable considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While it's not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at $825,000 is better than selling to John for $800,000. I've only got 6 rounds left, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price."
