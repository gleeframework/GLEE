"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Even if you fail, you can always buy from John for your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget, hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate down to my price. This is a bold move, but it's the best way to maximize potential savings.  If she rejects, I can always buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation. If I reject, I can either make a new counteroffer or simply buy from John. The potential savings from negotiating further outweigh the risk of losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so I'm increasing my offer slightly to $900,000. This is a compromise, but it still keeps me within a comfortable range. Hopefully, she'll accept this offer, but if not, I can always buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, but it's still above my ideal price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I believe there's still room for a lower price.  I have a safety net with John, so I can take a risk here.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my offer one last time to $950,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but I believe Alice might be willing to accept it. It's still below my ideal price, but it's a good balance between saving money and securing the deal. If she rejects, I'll finally buy from John to avoid further negotiation."
