Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for him to negotiate down slightly while still netting me a great price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing out on the deal."
