Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  This would give us both a fair price."", ""product_price"": 105}
