{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation, keeping in mind Bob's perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $875,000 isn't my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and still leaves me with a decent profit margin.  It's also a good compromise, and it seems Bob is serious about this offer.  I'll take it."
