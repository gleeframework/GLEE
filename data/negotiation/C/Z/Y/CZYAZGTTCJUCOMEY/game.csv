"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you consider something closer to $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $13,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product and I appreciate that. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250? That's a fair deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, while that's closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little over my budget. I can do $10,500, and I think that's a fair offer.",10500.0,Bob,6,
