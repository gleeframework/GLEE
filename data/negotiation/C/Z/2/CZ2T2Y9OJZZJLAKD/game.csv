"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for meeting me halfway. While I appreciate your flexibility, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $825,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $835,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer on the product at this price point.",835000.0,Alice,5,
