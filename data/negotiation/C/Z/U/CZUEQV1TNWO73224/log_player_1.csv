Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $20,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** My message emphasizes the product's value and attempts to justify the higher price, increasing the chances of Bob considering it seriously.
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation."
