"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000) than Alice's asking price ($9,500). This creates room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Respectful Tone:** I'm maintaining a polite and respectful tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** By phrasing it as a question (""Would you consider...""), I'm signaling that I'm open to hearing Alice's counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,000 is too low. Could you do $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to her bottom line ($8,000), and we're getting closer to John's offer ($10,000). I'll make one more attempt to get a slightly better price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand $7,000 is quite a jump. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** I'm proposing a price directly this time ($8,000) since we are getting into the later stages of negotiation.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This framing suggests fairness and a willingness to compromise.
* **Final Offer (Implied):** While not stated explicitly, this offer is close to my limit considering John's alternative. Alice is likely to accept, knowing I have another option."
