``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It is higher than John's offer, but leaves room for negotiation to reach a price closer to the product's value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am hoping to keep my investment within a budget of $1,050,000. Would you be able to consider this lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price. I can potentially still get a better deal by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $1,050,000 is below what I am willing to accept. Let's compromise at $1,080,000. This price still leaves you with a significant profit margin while allowing me to achieve a reasonable price for my product."", ""product_price"": 1080000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered my budget and would like to propose an offer of $1,060,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is only slightly lower than my counteroffer of $1,080,000. It's a reasonable price considering the risk of further negotiations, and I believe it's the best deal I can get at this point.  It's better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
