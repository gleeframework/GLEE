Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $300,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  This also leaves room for potential compromise in the future rounds."

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice. If I can get her down to my target price, I'll buy from her. However, if she doesn't budge, I'll buy from John in the next round."
