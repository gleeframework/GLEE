Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This price is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,500,000.  It's also a good starting point for negotiation, as it leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer while still giving me a good profit.
* **Message:** This message is friendly and professional. It highlights the value of the product to Bob while offering a price that is attractive to him. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum value as possible while still securing a deal with Bob. Starting with a lower price than my minimum allows for negotiation and potentially getting a better price than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $1200000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  While it's better than nothing, it's not a good deal for me. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price, especially considering John is willing to pay my minimum. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price by making a counteroffer.  I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum value,  but I'll also be mindful of the risk of losing Bob altogether if I push too hard."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,300,000:** This price is a compromise between my minimum desired price of $1,500,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000. It's a reasonable price that I'm willing to accept, and it leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the benefits of reaching an agreement. It also shows that I'm willing to be flexible and work with Bob to find a solution that works for both of us.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum value as possible while still maintaining a good relationship with Bob. By splitting the difference, I'm showing that I'm serious about negotiating a deal, but I'm also not willing to settle for a price that is significantly lower than my minimum.  I believe this approach gives me the best chance of securing a profitable deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but based on my current financial situation, I am unable to increase my offer beyond $1250000. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than the $1,500,000 I can get from John.  I'm not willing to take a loss on this sale, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer who is willing to pay my minimum.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit. By selling to John, I guarantee myself the best possible outcome, even if it means ending negotiations with Bob. I'm prioritizing certainty and a strong return over potential future negotiations with Bob.  There's always a risk that I could continue negotiations with Bob and fail to reach an agreement, leaving me with nothing."
