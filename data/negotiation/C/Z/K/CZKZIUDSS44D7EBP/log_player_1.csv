Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'm counter-offering $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'm counter-offering $990,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $990,000 is a strong deal. It avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds and nets a significantly higher profit than John's offer."
