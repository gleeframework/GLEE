"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is well above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will counteroffer, allowing us to start a dialogue. If he rejects outright, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired earnings. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him higher with my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's still a decent profit for Bob. I'm hoping he'll see the value in closing the deal and won't risk losing the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm determined to see if I can reach my desired price point, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,100,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a profit margin.  I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept before I have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him further in the next round. I have a few rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for less than I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  It's only a little below my minimum, and I'm hoping it's enough to convince Bob to accept before I have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a critical point. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but we're still far apart.  With only two rounds left, I don't have time to push for a better deal with Bob.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale and a good profit. I'll have to be more aggressive in future negotiations."
