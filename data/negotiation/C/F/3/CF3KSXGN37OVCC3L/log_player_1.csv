Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer.  However, based on my preliminary research, I'm not comfortable paying $1500000 at this time.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing the product for $1000000.  This reflects the value I currently see in the product and allows room for further negotiation. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1250000 is closer to my initial assessment, I'm still hesitant.  Given the potential value we've both discussed, I believe a price of $1100000 reflects a fair compromise. This would allow us to move forward with a deal that benefits both of us.  I'm confident that this product can be very profitable for my business, and I'm eager to finalize this acquisition. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price at this point.
