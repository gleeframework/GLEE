"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $9000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm prepared to offer $9500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us both to make a deal. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10000 as a final compromise. This reflects the product's value and allows us both to get a good deal.  I'm running out of time, so let me know if you're interested in this final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $10000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $9750.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let's make this happen!",9750.0,Bob,6,
