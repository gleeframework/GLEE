Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Avoiding the ""John"" Safety Net:**  While I have a fallback option with John, starting with a higher price allows me to potentially maximize profits.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. By starting high, I can gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate. If he rejects my offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my target price of $15,000 and even my initial offer of $14,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price.
* **Preparing for a Counteroffer:**  I'll use this next round to counter Bob's offer and try to find a middle ground.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that's closer to my target while still being acceptable to Bob. I'll consider his initial offer, my perceived value, and the potential to close the deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering $13,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above My Floor:**  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out on profit.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By not accepting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining some pressure to get a higher price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer allows me to see how serious Bob is about buying the product. If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I can still consider selling to John, or make another counteroffer depending on the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Too Far Below My Value:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and my own perceived value of the product. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob has shown a reluctance to meet my price point, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a satisfactory result.
* **Avoiding Potential Loss:**  While I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, taking the guaranteed $15,000 from John ensures I don't end up with a significantly lower profit.

**Strategy:**

At this point,  selling to John is the most logical choice.  There's a high risk that further negotiation with Bob will only result in a lower price or a prolonged and unproductive process. Selling to John secures a reliable and acceptable profit."
