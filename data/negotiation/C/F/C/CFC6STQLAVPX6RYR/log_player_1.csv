"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm thinking in the region of $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price than my initial offer. It's tempting to hold out for more, but there's a risk he'll walk away.
