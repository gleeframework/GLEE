"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for this product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this incredible product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I can do $9,000. That's a significant increase from my last offer and a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
