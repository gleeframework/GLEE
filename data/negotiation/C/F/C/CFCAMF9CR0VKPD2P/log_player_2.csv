Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this incredible product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems firm on not going below $10,500. While she *might* budge a little more, it's not worth the risk. You have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000, which meets your budget. Taking John's deal ensures you get the product and don't risk overpaying in further negotiations."
