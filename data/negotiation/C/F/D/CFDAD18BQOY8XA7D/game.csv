"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price. How about $1,100,000? This still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
