"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,300,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,250,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,275,000. This is a final offer from me. Let me know if you're interested.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
