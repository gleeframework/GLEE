,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think the initial price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,400,000 is still below my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'd like to counteroffer at $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
