"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $17,000.  This is above Bob's value, but I want to see if there's room for negotiation.  I'm also leaving myself some wiggle room in case Bob rejects my offer and we need to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price.  I'll counter offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $15,500. This is still above Bob's value, but it's closer to my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm serious about selling and agree to a price that is closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $14,500 is still a decent profit for me, and I'm not sure I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
