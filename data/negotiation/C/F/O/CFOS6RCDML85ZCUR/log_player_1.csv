Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it's really valuable, so I'm starting the price at $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** By starting at $200, you can gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat out rejects it, you know he's pretty set on a lower price. If he counters, you can get a better sense of his price range.
* **John as Backup:** You always have the option to walk away and sell to John for your minimum acceptable price, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low and significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's clear there's a substantial gap to bridge. You have a much better alternative in John ($150), so there's no need to settle for such a low price. It's time to counter and see if Bob is willing to negotiate more reasonably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is quite low for what I'm offering.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would you consider $160?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:** While $160 is a significant decrease from your initial offer, it's still comfortably above your minimum of $150 and leaves some room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting you ""meet in the middle,"" you're appealing to a sense of fairness and compromise, which can be persuasive in negotiations.
* **Testing Bob's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how flexible Bob is willing to be on price. If he rejects this offer outright, it might indicate he's not willing to move into a range acceptable to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $160 is still a bit much for me. Could we settle on $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer by only $10, signaling he's not willing to move much closer to your acceptable range.  Since you have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John, it's no longer worthwhile to continue negotiating with Bob. You're better off taking the guaranteed profit than risking further time and effort for an uncertain outcome."
