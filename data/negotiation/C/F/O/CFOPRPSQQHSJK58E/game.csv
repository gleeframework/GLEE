"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I need, it's still a bit lower than where I'd like to be.  Let's try $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to make a reasonable deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer.  $1,280,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make a final concession.  How about we settle on $1,320,000? This is a fair price for both of us.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1,320,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about we discuss $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,8,
