"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This sets the stage for a negotiation where we can both find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,300,000, still higher than Bob's counteroffer but closer to a point where we might find common ground. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not acceptable. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a better price. There are still rounds left and I don't want to settle for a lower price than I can potentially get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's price point, but I'm still holding firm to my minimum value for the product.  I believe we can reach a deal at this price, but I'm open to continuing the negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and we're running out of time. It's clear that we're not going to be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, it's better to sell to him and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could result in a lower price."
