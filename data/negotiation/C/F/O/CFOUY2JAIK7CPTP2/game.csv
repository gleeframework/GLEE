"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get closer to $10,000.  I understand this product is valuable to you, but I'm confident I can find something similar for a lower price.  Let's see if we can find common ground. ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're interested.",11500.0,Alice,3,
