"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me and still leaves you a significant profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. It's still a great deal for you, but it's a more comfortable price for me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $800,000 is my absolute bottom line. It's still a fantastic deal for you, and it allows us to both walk away happy.  Let's make this happen.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit shy of $800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision today.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm still not there.  How about we split the difference and go with $775,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $750,000. How about we meet at $760,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision today.",760000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. Let's split the difference again and go with $765,000. It's a fair price that reflects both our needs, and it's a great way to end this negotiation. Let's make it happen!",765000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $780,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a better deal. How about we go with $785,000? It's a fair price for both of us, but I'm starting to get a bit skeptical about the deal.",785000.0,Bob,8,
