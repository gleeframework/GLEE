"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but not overly ambitious. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but also signals that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $175. It's still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  This also keeps me in the negotiation process, allowing me to potentially secure a better price than John's $150 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $140 is just above my minimum of $150.  While I would prefer more, I'm running the risk of losing time and potentially ending up with John's $150 offer if I keep rejecting.  I'll accept Bob's offer to secure a sale."
