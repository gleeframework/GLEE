"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his maximum budget of $15,000 and also closer to his initial counteroffer of $10,500. Continuing to negotiate might get a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice backing out or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it."
