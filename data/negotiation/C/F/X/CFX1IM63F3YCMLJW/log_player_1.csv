Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly and inviting tone can make Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer if he wants to. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum as possible.
* **Keep the negotiation open:**  If Bob rejects, I can counteroffer or go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.
* **Negotiation leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain my leverage.  I can counter with a price closer to my desired amount, and potentially reach a mutually acceptable deal.
* **John is a backup:** Knowing that I can sell to John for $150 gives me confidence to hold out for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. However, $130 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $135? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This signals my willingness to negotiate while still trying to maximize my profit. 
* **Maintaining Value:** $135 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't sell the product below its worth.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle at $132.50.  That would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would mean a loss of only $7.50.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  If I reject, I can counter with a slightly higher price, but it's possible Bob will walk away, leaving me with no sale.
* **Time Factor:**  Further negotiation could prolong the process, and I don't want to risk John deciding to buy from someone else. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that's almost at my minimum, minimizing the potential for loss and ensuring a quick transaction."
