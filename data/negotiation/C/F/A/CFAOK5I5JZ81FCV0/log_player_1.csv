Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,750,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,350,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is not budging significantly on price.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll reach our minimum price of $1,500,000. John offers a guaranteed sale at our minimum acceptable price, making it the most logical option at this point."
