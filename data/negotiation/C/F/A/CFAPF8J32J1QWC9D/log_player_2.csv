"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $700,000 is a bold move, but it's a good starting point for negotiation.  This price is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000, leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and potentially raising her price again is high.  At this price, Bob is saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John, and the negotiation process is likely to take additional time.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice in this situation."
