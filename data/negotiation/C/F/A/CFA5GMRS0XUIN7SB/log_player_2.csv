"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $14,000. I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's room to negotiate down towards a more favorable price.  I'll counteroffer next."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful while clearly stating my price target. 
* **Leaving Room:**  There's a good chance Alice will counter, so I want to leave space to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, but there's still a gap. I'll counteroffer again, moving closer to her price but still aiming for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between her current offer ($13,000) and my previous offer ($11,000). 
* **Targeting Her Value:**  I know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so this offer is her break-even point. She might be willing to accept to avoid further negotiation.
* **Alternative in Mind:** If she rejects this, I'm getting close to my walk-away point. I'll likely take John's offer if she doesn't budge."
