"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum, you can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  You know the product is worth less than $1,000,000 to you, and you have a fallback option with John.  It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within your budget. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while aiming for a substantial saving. The message is polite and emphasizes a desire for a win-win situation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1025000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and still allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your target, but you can still potentially get a better deal. You know the product is worth less than $1,000,000 to you, and you have a fallback option with John.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This price would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while remaining within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

* **Target Price:** This counteroffer is your absolute maximum price. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is clear and concise, reiterating your budget constraints.
* **Fair Compromise:** It presents your offer as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Alice's sense of fairness. 
* **Direct Approach:** This direct approach focuses on the specific price, avoiding further lengthy negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1000000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price Comparison:** Alice's final offer is $1,050,000, which is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, which is within your budget and a better deal than Alice's final offer.
* **No Further Negotiation:** You've already made two counteroffers and Alice has rejected them. It's unlikely that further negotiation will result in a lower price from Alice. 

It's best to take advantage of John's offer and secure the product at your target price."
