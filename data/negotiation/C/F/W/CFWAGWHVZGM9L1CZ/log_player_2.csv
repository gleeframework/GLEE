"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is far too high for Bob's budget.  Bob should reject the offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but the product's intrinsic worth and potential are significantly higher.  I could consider letting it go for $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob should continue negotiating and try to bring the price down further. He can still purchase from John for $800,000 if the negotiation fails, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This reflects the value I place on the product while staying within my financial limits.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, and I respect that. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on $1,050,000? This price reflects the true value of what you're getting, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $800,000. There's still room for negotiation and Bob should continue to push for a lower price. He can always purchase from John for $800,000 if the deal with Alice falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This reflects a significant investment on my part and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
