"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider a price of $1,050,000. This reflects a more reasonable compromise considering its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is better than John's price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice and try to reach a price closer to his target of $900,000."
