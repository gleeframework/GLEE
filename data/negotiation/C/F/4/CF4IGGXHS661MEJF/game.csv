"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a significant amount for me and a fair price considering your asking price. I believe this is a good middle ground that allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I believe this is the minimum price I can accept to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. Would you be willing to meet me at $915,000?",915000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $915,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $890,000, which is a significant step for me. It's closer to your desired price and still allows for a profitable sale for you. I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price with this offer.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000.

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $912,500 is still more than I can afford at this time. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant amount for me.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise, allowing us both to walk away satisfied. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $900,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $910,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can see the value in this compromise.",910000.0,Alice,9,
