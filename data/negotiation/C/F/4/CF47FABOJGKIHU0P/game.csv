"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $14,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, however, $9,500 is quite a bit lower than I can accept.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value you place on the product, $11,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a good compromise. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
