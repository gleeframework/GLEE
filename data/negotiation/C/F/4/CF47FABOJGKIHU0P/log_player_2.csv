"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes sense to reject and negotiate. You can start with a counteroffer closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $14,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, however, $9,500 is quite a bit lower than I can accept.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle between your last offer and hers. You have room to make a counteroffer and still potentially save more money than buying from John."
