Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $140 is more than your minimum value of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's within a reasonable range:** $140 is not too far from Bob's value of $120, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **It allows for negotiation:** This offer provides room for Bob to counteroffer and for you to potentially meet in the middle.

Remember, the key is to find a price that maximizes your profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your value for the product, but I believe I can't exceed $120 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, and you don't want to risk losing the deal by rejecting it.  It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
