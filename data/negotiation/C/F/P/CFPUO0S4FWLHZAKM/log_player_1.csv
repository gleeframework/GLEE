Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate if he counteroffers.  If he rejects, I'll reassess and potentially drop the price a bit, but I won't go below $10,000.  I also have the option to sell to John at any point if the negotiations don't lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my ideal price before potentially accepting his offer or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm willing to come down a little more to try and close the deal with Bob.  I think $10,500 is a fair compromise, and if he rejects it, I'll be happy to sell to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to go below $10,000.  I've already come down from my initial price, and it seems like Bob is not willing to budge much further.  Therefore, I'll take John's offer and sell the product for $10,000, which is a fair price considering my minimum value for the product."
