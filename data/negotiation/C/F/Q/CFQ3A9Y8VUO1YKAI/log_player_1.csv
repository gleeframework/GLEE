{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $8,000.  I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $8,500?  That's a fair price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I think I can still squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, this product is truly worth more than $7,500. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $8000. I'm willing to go up to $7200, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'd like to get more from Bob, I'm running out of time and his offers are getting too low.  I've reached my minimum price with John, so it's time to sell to him and secure the deal."
