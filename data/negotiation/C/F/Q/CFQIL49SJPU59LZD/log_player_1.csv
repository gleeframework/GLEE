Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $19,000, which reflects its true worth and potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can confidently start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Aiming for the Most:** While Bob values the product at $10,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more, especially if your ""message"" effectively highlights the product's value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $19,000 offer leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, with a guaranteed sale to John, you're not losing out completely. This strategy maximizes your potential profit."
