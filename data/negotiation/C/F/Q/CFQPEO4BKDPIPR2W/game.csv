"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good profit, and I believe it's a fair price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value you've placed on the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,150,000? This would be a fair compromise, and would still give you a solid profit margin.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,150,000. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $1,250,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
