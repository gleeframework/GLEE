"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and assess his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $10,000 is far too low for me, as I value the product at no less than $15,000. It's better to continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,500.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but still maintains a substantial profit for me. I believe this price is fair and gives Bob a good opportunity to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable accepting. John's offer of $15,000 is still a better option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $16,000. This is a compromise that gives Bob a bit more room to bargain, but still allows me to earn a significant profit. I believe this price is close enough to John's offer that it's worth pushing for a deal with Bob, as he may be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a difficult decision, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I can still sell to John for $15,000, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds.  Accepting Bob's offer at $14,000 guarantees a sale and  is a reasonable profit. It's important to remember that every round is a chance for Bob to walk away."
