Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $80,  it's best to start negotiations with a price closer to your minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer rather than risking losing the deal.

**Alternative Strategy:** You could also open with a slightly lower price (e.g., $130) to increase the chances of Bob accepting immediately. However, this strategy risks leaving potential profit on the table if Bob was willing to pay closer to $140."
