``` 

While I could continue to push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,230,000 is the most strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** We are still securing a profit of $430,000 ($1,230,000 - $800,000), which is well above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to push Bob could lead to negotiation fatigue and potentially make him less willing to compromise. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now allows us to access and utilize the funds sooner, which has its own inherent value.

Accepting this offer balances the desire for maximum profit with the practicalities of negotiation and the time value of money."
