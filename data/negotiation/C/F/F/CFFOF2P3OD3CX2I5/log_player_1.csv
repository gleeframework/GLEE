"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with a price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that sets a high expectation for the negotiation.  I'm aiming to maximize my profits and see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still aiming for something above $900,000.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product and how much he's willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to close the deal, but if he rejects again, I'll have to reassess my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $920,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm confident I can get closer to my target with another counteroffer. I'm going to try to bridge the gap between our positions in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 935000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $935,000. This is a smaller increment than before, demonstrating my willingness to compromise further while still trying to get a price I'm comfortable with. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the offer, but if he rejects again, I'll have to reconsider my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  The negotiation has been going on for a few rounds, and while I'd prefer a higher price, I'm realizing that Bob might not be willing to go much higher.  $925,000 is a good price, and it's important to close the deal before I risk losing both Bob and potentially John as a buyer.  This is a good balance between profit and risk."
