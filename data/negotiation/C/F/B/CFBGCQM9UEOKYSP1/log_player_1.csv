Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price point gives me a buffer to potentially accept a counteroffer if necessary. 
* **Positive messaging:** The message focuses on the benefits for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Maintaining John as a backup:** I keep John as an option to sell the product for my desired price if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1150000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1050000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for counteroffers:** I still have room to negotiate with Bob. I can counter with a price closer to my desired value,  hoping to find a middle ground.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  John is a reliable backup option, guaranteeing my minimum desired profit if the negotiation with Bob fails."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer,  $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the value of the product to remind Bob of its worth.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation friendly. 
* **Still above my minimum:**  $1,100,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's lower than my initial offer.  

This strategy aims to find a compromise that's acceptable to both parties while keeping my potential profit as high as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $1100000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1075000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that you're still making a good profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, $1,075,000 is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. 
* **Closing the gap:** There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit, allowing me to take a calculated risk with Bob.

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground that allows for a good profit."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,087,500. This is a fair compromise, and it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1087500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's last offer and my previous one. This demonstrates a willingness to find common ground and shows a commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Highlighting the benefit for both:** The message focuses on the ""good deal"" for both parties, emphasizing the fairness of the offer.
* **Finalizing the deal:** By using phrases like ""finalizing the deal"" and ""move forward,"" I create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

This offer strategically balances my desire for a higher price with the need to close the deal and avoid selling to John at a lower profit."
