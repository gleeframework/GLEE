"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer,  $1050000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $1100000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1075000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that you're still making a good profit.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $1075000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1087500. This is a fair compromise, and it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
