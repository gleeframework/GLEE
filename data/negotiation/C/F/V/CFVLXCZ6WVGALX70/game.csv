"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I'm willing to be flexible, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product to you. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer it for $925,000.  This would ensure a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $925,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you consider $880,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",880000.0,Bob,4,
