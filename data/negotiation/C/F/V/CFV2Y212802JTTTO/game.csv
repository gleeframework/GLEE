"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to your business. I understand it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This price represents a significant opportunity for you, while still allowing me to achieve a substantial return on my investment.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
