Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and still being attractive to Bob.  

* **For me:** I'm earning $1,500 more than I would from John. 
* **For Bob:**  He's still getting a good deal, saving $500 compared to his perceived value. 

This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while ensuring I get a better price than John's offer."
