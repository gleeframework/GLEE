"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,500.** This is lower than your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Buying from John would cost you $12,000.** 
* **Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $500.** 

It's always better to get the product for a lower price, even if it's only a small difference."
