"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is competitive, it's still higher than my maximum budget. There are 10 rounds for negotiation, and it's likely I can get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise.

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I have more rounds available to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can further reduce the price."

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, but $1,150,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a lower price before considering purchasing from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is closer to where I want to be, it's still a bit high.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to $1,125,000 or potentially even lower.  If I can't make significant progress in the next couple of rounds, I'll likely go with John's offer."

Round 8

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round, and while Alice has lowered her price, $1,135,000 is still above my ideal price. Given that we're almost out of time and I have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, it's more prudent to take John's offer and secure the product at a lower price than to risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up with no deal."
