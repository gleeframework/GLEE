"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way beyond my budget for this.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  What can you do?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value, I understand your perspective.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, $1,700,000 is still more than I'm able to spend. To make this work, I can go up to $1,100,000.  Let me know if that's within the realm of possibility.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations here.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,450,000, but that's my firm limit.  This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
