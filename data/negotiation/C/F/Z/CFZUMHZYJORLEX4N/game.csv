"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,300,000 is a fair offer, I'm looking for something closer to my initial price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This gives us both some room to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000?  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm willing to be flexible,  $1,325,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,337,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to achieve a positive outcome.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
