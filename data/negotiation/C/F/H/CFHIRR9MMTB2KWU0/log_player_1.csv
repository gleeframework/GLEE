Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is higher than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, allowing for potential counteroffers and a win-win scenario.
* **It shows confidence:**  By starting high, you demonstrate the value of the product and set a strong negotiating position.

If Bob rejects, you can consider lowering the price slightly depending on his counteroffer and your urgency to sell. However, always remember that John is waiting in the wings with a $10,000 offer, so you're not under immense pressure to accept any deal lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than what you want to get for the product. You can do better!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, I can't go as low as $10,000.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,750? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is too low. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that Bob is trying to push the price down as much as possible. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when you already have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000. Selling to John ensures you get a reasonable price without any further hassle."
