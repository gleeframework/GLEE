"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to you. I'm happy to offer it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer. 
* **Open-ended:** The question encourages Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Even though Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price.
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm not desperate to sell, so I can use John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's price, showing flexibility.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, justifying my price point. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $135, so how about $132.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:**  Bob's offer is only $2.50 away from my last counteroffer, which is getting very close to my desired price range.
* **Time Factor:**  We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John.
* **Risk/Reward:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, it's not clear if Bob will budge further. Accepting his offer is the safest move to ensure a sale."
