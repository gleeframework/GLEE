"I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'd like to accommodate you, the cost of production and our business margins require us to maintain a minimum price. Therefore, I propose a compromise of $85 for the product. This is a price point that allows us to cover our costs while still being competitive in the market. I hope this meets your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $75. I think this is a fair price that takes into account the value I'll get from the product, and I'm willing to make a decision at this price. Can you consider this offer?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. After careful consideration, I would like to extend a counteroffer of $80 for the product. This price reflects a balance between covering our costs and remaining competitive in the market. I believe this offers a fair solution for both parties involved. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations and allows us to finalize the transaction.",80.0,Alice,5,
