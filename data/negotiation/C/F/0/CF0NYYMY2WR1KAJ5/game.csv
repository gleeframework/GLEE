"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $8500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $8000, but I'm not ready to accept yet. I've already received another offer from a potential buyer, and I'm not sure if I want to wait. I'll make one more counteroffer to you: $8500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go as high as $8750. This is my last offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",8750.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'm unable to meet at $8750. My final offer remains at $8000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,6,
