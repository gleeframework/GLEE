{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate, but also leaves some space for him to feel like he's getting a good deal.  It's also lower than your minimum acceptable price, so you still have room to maneuver if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to try and counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering our both trying to reach an agreement. Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and it seems he's unlikely to go higher.  While I'd prefer $15,000, it's better to accept this offer than risk losing the sale altogether or having to go through more rounds of negotiation."
