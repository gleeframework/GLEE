I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's lower than what the product is worth to him, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  This allows for some potential negotiation room while still ensuring a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is a good deal for me. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price,  $13,500 is still a reasonable price that allows me to make a good profit. It's also above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting his offer avoids the risk of further negotiation and ensures a quick sale."
