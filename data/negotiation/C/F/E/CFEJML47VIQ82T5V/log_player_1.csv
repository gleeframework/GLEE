Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, I am currently working within a budget that restricts me to a maximum of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to counteroffer at $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is stubbornly sticking to a price far below what we know the product is worth to him.  It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would be a substantial loss. Selling to John guarantees our minimum acceptable profit."
