Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $160. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and creates the impression that the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting high, I give Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer. This helps me gauge his interest level and willingness to pay.
* **Backup Plan (John):** I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I don't have to settle for less than $120. This knowledge allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $160 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob increased his offer, $100 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  His counteroffer suggests he's interested and willing to negotiate further. There's a chance I can get him closer to my desired price. 
* **John as leverage:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer allows me to be patient and not settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $130? This product is truly high-quality, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and show willingness to negotiate by moving down from my initial price. 
* **Strategic Price Point:** $130 is still comfortably above my minimum, but it's a significant decrease from my previous offer, which might make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm reinforcing the product's value to encourage Bob to accept the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and settle on $115? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $115 is above my absolute minimum of $120. While I could push for more, the difference is now relatively small.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether. Bob has shown a willingness to meet in the middle, and further haggling might make him walk away.
* **Time Value:** Reaching a deal now means I can move on to other potential sales. The extra $5 I might gain from selling to John isn't worth the potential time and effort of further negotiation with Bob or finding a new buyer."
