Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $9,500 is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth without immediately hitting a wall. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response and the potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it's also below my initial offer of $9,500.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, potentially even getting closer to my desired $10,000. 
* **Avoiding Selling to John:**  While selling to John guarantees $10,000, I'm willing to risk a bit more to potentially maximize my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  $9,000 is a compromise between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also highlights that the product has value.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  This offer still allows for further negotiation if Bob rejects it. 
* **Signal a Desire for a Deal:** By offering a price in the middle ground, I'm signaling my willingness to reach an agreement. 
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** This offer remains above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, ensuring I'm not losing money on the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** Bob's offer of $8,750 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate may result in a lower price, putting me at a significant financial loss.
* **Time is Money:**  Negotiations can take time and energy, and I'm losing potential profits by delaying the sale. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees a decent profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.

**Conclusion:**  It's time to cut my losses and secure the deal with John. While I might be able to get slightly more from Bob, the risk of a lower price or prolonged negotiations outweighs the potential gains."
