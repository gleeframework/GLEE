Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for significantly less."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that I'm willing to consider, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still $2,500 more than he's willing to pay.  He can still get the product from John for his desired price."
