"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a new offer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm willing to let go of the product for. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500. This is a fair compromise, considering I'm already paying more than what I'd get from John. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $15,000 is still a bit too high for you, but $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $14,500. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping you'll find it acceptable.",14500.0,Alice,5,
