"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I find the price of $2,300,000 to be a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my end and reflects the maximum budget I have allocated for this acquisition.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and the investment put into its development.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,850,000.  I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $1,250,000? I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the product's value and allows me to make this important investment.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, and I want to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,550,000?  This allows me to recoup a fair value for the product while staying within a reasonable range for you.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, $1,550,000 is just a bit outside of what I had budgeted. I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $1,400,000. It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can make this work.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
