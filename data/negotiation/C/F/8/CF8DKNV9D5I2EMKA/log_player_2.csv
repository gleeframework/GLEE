# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is lower than your maximum willingness to pay of $12,000. This means you're getting a good deal. While you could potentially bargain further, it's not necessary since you're already getting a $2,500 discount."
