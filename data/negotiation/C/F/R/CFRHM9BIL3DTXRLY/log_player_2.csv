{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still possible to negotiate lower. We have 10 rounds, so there's room to explore a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A $2,000 reduction from her initial offer demonstrates my serious interest while leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but there's still room for further negotiation. I want to see if she's willing to go lower than $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying within my budget.  This counteroffer is a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally met my counteroffer. While I would ideally like to pay less, accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a significantly discounted price compared to John's offer. With 5 rounds remaining, there is a risk that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or Alice's counteroffers becoming more unfavorable."
