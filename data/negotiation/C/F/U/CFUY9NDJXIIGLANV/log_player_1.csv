``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.  I've also emphasized the value proposition to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price. While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000.  How about we settle on $1,350,000? It's a fair compromise and a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've considered your proposal, and I would like to counter with a price of $1,325,000. This is my best offer given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,350,000. While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still negotiate a slightly higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product at a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1340000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I've reviewed it carefully, and I would like to counter with a price of $1,330,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise given our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $1,330,000. While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and this offer is still significantly better than selling to John for $1,200,000. There's a good chance Bob might reject my counteroffer, and we might end up at the same price after a few more rounds. I'm confident that I've secured a fair deal, considering the time constraint and Bob's willingness to negotiate."
