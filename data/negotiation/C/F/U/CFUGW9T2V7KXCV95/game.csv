"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering you a deal at $82. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $82 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet in the middle and pay $78.  Let me know what you think.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $80, as that's the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $78 and $80, so I'm offering you a deal at $79.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",79.5,Alice,5,
