{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob:**  This creates room for potential compromise.
* **It establishes a firm price point:** This makes it clear what you're willing to accept. 

By starting high, you can potentially secure a higher price while still giving Bob room to negotiate. Remember, you can always lower your price if Bob rejects your initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
