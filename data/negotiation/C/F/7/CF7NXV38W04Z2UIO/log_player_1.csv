{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $16,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I've started with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, as this gives me room to negotiate if he counter-offers. I've also used a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering your product. I'm interested, but $16,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I want to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to compromise that much. I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $14,000?  It's still a fair deal for both of us, and it gives you a great value."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I've counter-offered with $14,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's closer to Bob's offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate. I've also reiterated the value of the product and the fairness of the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $14,000 is closer, but still a bit much. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise that much further.  I'm confident that John will purchase the product at my desired price, so I'll take the safe option and sell to him."
