"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm still very interested in the product, but I'd like to get a better deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering, and it's still within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final adjustment to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $10300. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to make the deal.",10300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to make one final adjustment, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $9800, as I mentioned in my previous offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere.",9800.0,Bob,6,
