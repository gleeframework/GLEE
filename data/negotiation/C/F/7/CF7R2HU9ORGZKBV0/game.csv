"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $825000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $825000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident I can find a similar product for closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $815000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",815000.0,Alice,5,
