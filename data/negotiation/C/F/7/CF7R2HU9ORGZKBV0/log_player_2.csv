# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $825000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

You can likely get a better price than $825,000.  You've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate.  Try to get closer to your target price of $750,000."

Alice is now offering a price that's very close to your counteroffer.  It's likely that you won't be able to get a significantly lower price, and you're only $15,000 away from your target price.  Accepting her offer is the best decision at this point."
