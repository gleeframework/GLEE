"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and so am I. While I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This reflects a more accurate assessment of its value and allows us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I still think $1,000,000 is too high. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential and my willingness to negotiate.",850000.0,Bob,4,
