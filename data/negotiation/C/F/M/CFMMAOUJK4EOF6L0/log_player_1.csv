Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I believe it's worth at least $800,000 to you, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000,  starting high anchors the negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely implies the product's value is even higher than Bob's valuation.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency, pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**This strategy aims to:**

* **Maximize profit:** If Bob accepts, you earn significantly more than your minimum.
* **Provide a fallback:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a secure buyer."
