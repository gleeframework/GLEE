Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. I believe it's a great deal and worth considering."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $115 offer allows space for Bob to negotiate and potentially meet in the middle, still netting me a profit above my minimum.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John gives me leverage. I won't feel pressured to accept low offers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price around $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate. Accepting immediately would leave potential profit on the table. I'll aim for a counteroffer that's closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob. How about we settle at $110? That feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer to show willingness to negotiate but held firm on a price above my minimum. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and emphasizes fairness, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Backup Option Still Valid:** I haven't forgotten about John, so I won't feel pressured to accept an offer below $110."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:**  $107.50 is still a profitable price, exceeding my minimum of $100.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant gains. Bob is clearly trying to get the best deal, and we're already very close.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of Bob walking away or finding an alternative. Accepting now secures the sale and avoids potential delays."
