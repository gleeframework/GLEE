"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1200000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to that.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid $800000 is below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1000000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1000000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $900000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $1050000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
