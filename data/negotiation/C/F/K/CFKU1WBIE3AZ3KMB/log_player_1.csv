Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000.  This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, while still leaving me a good profit. I'm confident that he'll be willing to pay at least $8,000, so there's potential for a deal here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is a compromise that's still within my acceptable range, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $7,800 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation and it's clear that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price. To avoid further delays and ensure I get a decent price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000."
