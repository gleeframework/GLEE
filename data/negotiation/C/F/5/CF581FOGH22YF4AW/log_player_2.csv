"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. However, I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for my investment. With that in mind, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still above my budget.

This would be a significant savings for you compared to selling to John, and would allow me to acquire the product within my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value I've invested in this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $975000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell it to you for $925000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value I've invested in this product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting close to his budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price, potentially closer to his $800,000 budget. While there's a risk that Alice will walk away, Bob still has the option to buy from John if negotiations fail."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $925,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a substantial amount and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product. This would be a win-win situation, as it's a significant discount compared to your initial offer, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's find a common ground and reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 910000}
