Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your work, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially offering it for $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to discussing that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $22,000 is still a significant drop. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and what it can do for you."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is not budging significantly from his initial offer. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's beneficial for me.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
