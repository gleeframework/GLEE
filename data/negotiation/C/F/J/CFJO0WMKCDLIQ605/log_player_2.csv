# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,000? That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already saved $500 from his original budget of $12,000.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away and he'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
