"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers substantial value that goes beyond its immediate price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I am unable to meet at $1,900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This price still allows me to consider the product's potential while staying within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
