"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $107.50?  That's a good compromise, and I'm sure we can agree on it.",107.5,Bob,4,
