"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,200?  This price reflects the value you'll gain from it.",10200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle on $9,850. This would ensure a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",9850.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $9,850 is tempting, I can't let it go for less than $10,000. This is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings.",10000.0,Alice,5,
