"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $9,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I don't want to insult Alice, starting significantly lower than her offer leaves room for negotiation and signals I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation.
* **Justification:** I've provided a reason for my counteroffer without revealing my absolute maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but the price is still too high. I'll continue negotiating to try and get closer to $10,000. It's important to remember I have the backup option of buying from John, so I won't accept a price that's not beneficial for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  I'm proposing a price directly in between our last offers, signaling a willingness to compromise but also holding firm on my budget. 
* **Clear and Direct:** The offer is straightforward, aiming for a quick and agreeable resolution.
* **Sense of Finality:** While open to further negotiation, the tone suggests this is a strong offer and close to my final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to an agreement, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has declared her ""final offer"" and seems unwilling to budge further. 
* **Unfavorable Price:** $11,500 is still significantly above both Alice's valuation and a reasonable compromise point. 
* **Backup Option:**  Knowing I can get the product from John for $15,000 provides a safety net. While not ideal, it's better than overpaying with Alice. 

It seems unlikely further negotiation will yield a satisfactory result. It's time to walk away from this deal and exercise my backup option."
