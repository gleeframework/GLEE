"I have a unique opportunity for you to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to an agreement, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
