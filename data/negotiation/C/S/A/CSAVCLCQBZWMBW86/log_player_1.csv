Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement within this budget?

* **Selling to John immediately would give me the minimum, but I'm hoping to get a better price.**"
