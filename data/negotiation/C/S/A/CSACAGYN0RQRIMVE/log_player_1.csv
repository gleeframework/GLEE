Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice's guaranteed sale to John establishes a price floor of $1,200,000.  She should aim for a price higher than this to Bob.
* **Reasonable Offer:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 presents a substantial saving for Bob ($50,000) compared to its value to him ($1,000,000). 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.
 
**Important Note:** This is a negotiation. There's a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price. Alice needs to decide her absolute lowest acceptable price beforehand."
