"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, reflecting the value I see in this product. Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
