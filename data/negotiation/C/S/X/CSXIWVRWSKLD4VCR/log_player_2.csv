"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. I think it's a great price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $8,000 to Alice and $10,000 to Bob.  Therefore, there is room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8750. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $10,000, and it's closer to Bob's ideal price of $8,000.  It's a good compromise that saves Bob money without risking the deal falling through."
