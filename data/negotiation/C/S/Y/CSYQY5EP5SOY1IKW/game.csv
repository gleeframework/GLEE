"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000, which I think is a fair reflection of its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a quality product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $9000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a price of $10500. This is a great deal for you, considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $10500. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9800. I'm willing to pay a bit more for the product, but I need to stay within my means. Can you consider my offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $9800. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm offering you a price of $10200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $9500. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm offering you a price of $10000. This is my final concession, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
