"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum target. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a better compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $13500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum target, and I'm comfortable accepting it at this point. There's a chance I could get a better deal with another counteroffer, but I'm also concerned about running out of time."
