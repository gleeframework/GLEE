Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is certainly a significant sum, the true value of this product goes beyond that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,000,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

We're getting close, but I think there's still room for Bob to go higher. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $975,000 at this point."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm still a bit short on my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I need to get closer to my target. Can you consider $955,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $955,000

While I'd prefer to get closer to $975,000, accepting Bob's offer of $955,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly more than my fallback option with John, and prolonging the negotiations further might not yield a much better outcome."
