"Alice, $20,000 is way out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider $16,000? I'm willing to negotiate but need a price that reflects the product's worth.",16000.0,Alice,3,
