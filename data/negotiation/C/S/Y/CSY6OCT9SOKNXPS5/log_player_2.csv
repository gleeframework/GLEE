"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is your maximum, there's no reason to immediately accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows for potential negotiation and a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (20%) is a common negotiation tactic. This shows Alice you're serious about buying but also willing to push for a lower price.  It sets the stage for a potential back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit from her initial price, but it's still above my ideal price point. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows me to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from Round 2, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise.  A $500 increase is a smaller step than Alice's $500 decrease, suggesting I'm closer to my final price point.  This keeps the pressure on Alice to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down further, $11,200 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my goal of $10,500.  I've also got 5 rounds left, so there's time for more back-and-forth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and I'm doing the same by meeting her halfway. Offering $11,000 shows good faith while still leaving room for potential concessions from Alice.  With only four rounds left, it's important to make a move towards closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,100, which is very close to my last offer of $11,000. With only three rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting.  While I'd prefer to get it for $11,000, it's likely Alice won't budge further. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price within my acceptable range and avoids potentially ending up buying from John at a higher price."
