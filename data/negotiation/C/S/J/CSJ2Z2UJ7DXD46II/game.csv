"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is significantly higher than I had budgeted.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is a significant jump, we're still quite a ways apart.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price reflects the true value of this unique product and the immense potential it holds.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I'm targeting a price closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider something in that range?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I appreciate your position and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the very lowest I can go while still reflecting the product's significant value.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but that price point is still not feasible for me. I can go as high as $1,350,000, but that's absolutely my limit. If we can make a deal at that price, I'm ready to move forward. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
