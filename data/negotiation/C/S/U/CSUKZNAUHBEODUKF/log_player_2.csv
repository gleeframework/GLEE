Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $800,000?  I believe that's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Could we consider $950,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 just isn't feasible for me. Given the product's unique value and potential, I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end, and it's a price that reflects a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find common ground and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not budging much below $1,100,000.  While she might come down a little more, it's unlikely she'll go as low as John's $1,000,000 offer.  At this point, cutting your losses and securing the product from John for the guaranteed best price is the most logical move."
