"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $800,000?  I believe that's a fair price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Could we consider $950,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 just isn't feasible for me. Given the product's unique value and potential, I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end, and it's a price that reflects a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find common ground and make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
