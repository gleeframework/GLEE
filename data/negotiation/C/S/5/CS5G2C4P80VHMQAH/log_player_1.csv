Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to what I believe the product is worth.  It's also a significant enough increase from my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) to make it worthwhile for Bob to potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is still a considerable amount above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will lead to a better deal.  Given that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, I'm going to sell the product to him to guarantee that I receive at least my minimum acceptable price."
