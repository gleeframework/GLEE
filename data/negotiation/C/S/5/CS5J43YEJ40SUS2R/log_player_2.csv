"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and importance to both of us, I propose a special introductory price of $11,500 for this round. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good starting price, it's still a bit higher than Bob's ideal value for the product.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm aiming to stay closer to my budget. Would you consider $10,500?  I believe this price reflects the value I place on the product, while still offering you a fair return."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet within your budget. In light of that, I would like to extend a counteroffer of $11,000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the value we place on the product and your budget constraints. I hope this proposal is more amenable to your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $11,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price. Since there are many rounds left, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I value the product, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This offer demonstrates my commitment to a deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've considered your latest offer and I'd like to respond with a counteroffer of $10,900. This price aims to find a middle ground between our positions, ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. I hope this proposal is more acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now come down to $10,900, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $10,500.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there is a risk that Alice might walk away.  Since there are only 5 rounds remaining, it's a good time to accept the offer and avoid the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
