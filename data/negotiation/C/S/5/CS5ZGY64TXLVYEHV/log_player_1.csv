"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price or potentially reach a compromise.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $11000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I believe there's room for further negotiation.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $11,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $11,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11250}
