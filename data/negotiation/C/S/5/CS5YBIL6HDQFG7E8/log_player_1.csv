Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be very valuable to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is more than Bob's perceived value but less than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value to Bob, increasing the likelihood of him considering the offer. 
* **Option to Walk Away:** I'm leaving the door open for a deal with John if Bob doesn't accept. This creates pressure on Bob to come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,050,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is willing to negotiate, indicating there's room for a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the leverage to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. This reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm countering with a price of $1,150,000, which is a significant move from my previous offer but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Framing for Value:** My message emphasizes that this price is still a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** I reiterate the goal of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement to encourage a positive response.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I'm still holding the option of selling to John, which keeps the pressure on Bob to come to an agreement."
