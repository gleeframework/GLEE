Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have John as a backup.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offered price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($80), but low enough that he might consider it a good deal if he's motivated to buy. 

**Important:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $140. He might counter-offer, or reject it outright. The important thing is to start the negotiation from a strong position."
