"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Knowing how much this could benefit you, I'm offering it to you for $925,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). This means there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you can potentially push for a lower price or explore other options."
