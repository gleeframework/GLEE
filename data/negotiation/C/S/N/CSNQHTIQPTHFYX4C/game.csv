"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product is valuable, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $750,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your concerns. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. While $750,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would that price point be feasible?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're getting close to your target, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
