# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $750,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your concerns. What do you think?

# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to your target, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?

This seems like a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:**  You're getting a $275,000 discount from Alice's original offer and a $275,000 discount compared to John's price.
* **Alice's Limit:** Alice has indicated this is her lowest price.  Further negotiation might be fruitless and risk the deal.
* **Time Value:** Continuing negotiations has a cost in terms of time and effort. Accepting now secures the product."
