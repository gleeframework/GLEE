"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering less than my minimum, even if it's only slightly.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a better price for a couple more rounds.  If I don't get closer to my target, I'll be willing to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also serious about getting a fair price.  We are getting close to the end of the negotiation. If this offer fails, I may consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still offering less than my minimum acceptable price, and we are getting close to the end of the negotiation. While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price from Bob, I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer and will pay my minimum.  It's better to secure a guaranteed sale at a reasonable price than risk losing a deal with Bob and potentially ending up with no sale at all."
