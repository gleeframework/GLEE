"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value the product offers you.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While I understand the value, $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you consider $9,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is still a bit lower than I can accept.  Could we split the difference and go with $11,250?  I'm genuinely trying to find a solution that works for both of us. Let me know if this is something you can consider.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your counter.  I'm getting closer to my limit.  How about we make it $10,500 and call it a deal? That's a fair offer considering my budget.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence. $10,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Would you consider $12,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's try to make this deal happen!",12000.0,Alice,7,
