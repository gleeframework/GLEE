Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (your minimum acceptable price), you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strong Starting Point:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 gives you room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties, you create a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Value-Based Language:**  The message focuses on the ""value and potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or has concerns about the price. You can always adjust your offer slightly downward during the negotiation process, but remember your bottom line is $1,200,000."
