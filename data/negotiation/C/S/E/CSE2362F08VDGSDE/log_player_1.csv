Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still giving me a profit. I'm confident in the value of the product and believe I can get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept Bob's first counteroffer.  I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping the price slightly to $110. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to make a profit. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where I'm not willing to negotiate further with Bob. He's not budging on his price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm better off selling the product to John for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price."
