"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and Alice is offering it at the same price, there is no immediate benefit to accepting. It's best to start negotiating and try to get a lower price."

Alice's counteroffer of $1,400,000 is still too high. I'm aiming to save as much as possible, so I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, which is a bit closer to my target. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for me.  I'm happy to accept this offer and save $150,000 compared to buying from John."
