"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's something I truly value, but I believe it can be even more impactful in your hands.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and my belief in its potential for Bob, subtly justifying the high initial price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-propose rather than walk away.

By starting significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value, I aim to understand his negotiation style and willingness to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree the product has potential, but that price is quite steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's counter-offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value of the product. This indicates he's likely testing my willingness to concede.  By rejecting this lowball offer, I signal that I'm serious about the product's worth and am not desperate to make a quick sale. I'm willing to negotiate, but not from a position of weakness."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, your offer is quite a ways off from what I believe the product is truly worth. To find middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This reflects my strong belief in its value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above My Minimum:** I've reduced my price considerably from the initial offer, signaling flexibility.  Importantly, this counteroffer remains significantly above my $1,000,000 minimum and closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justified Compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a compromise and reiterates the product's value as justification for the still-high price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal whether Bob is willing to engage in meaningful negotiation or if he's anchored to a drastically lower valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value to you, but I need a price that works for me too. I can go up to $650,000.  That's a significant offer. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still far below both my minimum and a reasonable compromise point.  His incremental increases suggest he might be trying to bargain at a very slow pace to wear me down.  I need to show him that while I'm open to negotiation, I'm also prepared to walk away from a deal that doesn't value the product fairly.  Rejecting this keeps the pressure on Bob to make a more serious offer while leaving me the option to go with John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offer is still significantly below what I consider a fair price. This product has considerable value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm, But Fair:** I'm making it clear that while I'm open to a deal, I won't undervalue the product. The message is firm but maintains a professional tone.
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm introducing a sense of urgency and emphasizing the need for Bob to respond seriously.
* **Strategic Price:** The price is still a significant markup from my minimum and a reasonable compromise considering Bob's perceived value. 
* **Prepared for Both Outcomes:** This offer puts the ball in Bob's court.  If he accepts, I get a great deal. If he rejects it, I'm prepared to walk away and work with John, ensuring I don't go below my minimum."
