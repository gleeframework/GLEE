"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,050,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum. He can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, or he has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to explore more options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering an alternative purchase from another seller.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,030,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous one. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already made his final offer of $1,000,000 and Alice rejected it.  While Alice has come down slightly to $1,030,000, it is still above Bob's budget. It's clear that further negotiation will be difficult and time-consuming. 

At this point, Bob has a better alternative: buying the product from John for $1,000,000.  This saves him $30,000 compared to Alice's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  It's time to move on and secure the deal with John."
