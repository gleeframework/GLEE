"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is enticing, it's still above her valuation of the product ($1,200,000).  There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to work with you.  While I value the product highly, I'm currently unable to go that high.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This price still represents a significant profit for you and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $1,000,000 price tag. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good deal. It's lower than my initial maximum budget of $1,500,000 and still leaves room for profit for Alice.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice walking away or me having to buy from John at a higher price makes this offer attractive."
