"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your budget. How about we meet in the middle at 135? It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a little more than I'm willing to spend.  How about we split the difference and settle on $127.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a decent profit.",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. How about we settle on 130? It's a small compromise, but I think it's fair for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
