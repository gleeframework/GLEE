"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. Let me know if you're interested!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase such an item. However, my budget is limited to $800000 for this product. Would you consider accepting this offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $800000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique product. How about we meet in the middle at $1200000? If not, I'm open to further discussion.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1200000 is closer to my budget, I still feel it's a bit too high. Could we aim for $950000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $950000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1075000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your effort in trying to meet my budget constraints. I am willing to consider $1050000 as a fair compromise, given the unique nature of the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $1050000 is a good starting point. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $1075000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts in trying to reach a mutual agreement, Alice. Given the situation, I believe $1050000 is the most I can offer. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you, considering the unique nature of the product.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
