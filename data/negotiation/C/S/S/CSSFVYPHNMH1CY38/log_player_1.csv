Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  Would you be willing to come down to $6800?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
