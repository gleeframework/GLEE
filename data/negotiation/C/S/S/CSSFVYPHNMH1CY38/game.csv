"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  Would you be willing to come down to $6800?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",6800.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $6800 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $7250, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",7250.0,Alice,3,
