"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob can likely get a better deal than $7,500.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,800?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 6800}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $6800 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $7250, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,250 is still more than he'd like to pay, it's a better deal than buying from John for $8,000. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a lower price."
