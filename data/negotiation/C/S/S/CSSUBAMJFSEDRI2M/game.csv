"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price of $12,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a valuable item that's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, and I'm willing to be fair.  How about we settle on $11,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it's a price we can both agree on.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great price for a product worth $15,000 to you, if I do say so myself.",12000.0,Alice,5,
