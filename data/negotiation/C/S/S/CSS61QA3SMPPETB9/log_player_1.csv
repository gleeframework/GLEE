Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring I make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no pressure to go below my minimum."
