"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,060,000. This is my maximum price, and I hope it allows us to reach an agreement.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
