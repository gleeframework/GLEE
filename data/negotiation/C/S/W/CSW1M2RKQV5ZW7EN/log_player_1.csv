Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for negotiation, indicating that I'm willing to work with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer. 
* **If negotiation stalls:** I'll consider selling to John for $12,000 to ensure a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value to you, but I believe I can't exceed $12,000 for this purchase. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, the negotiation has already taken some time. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potential rejection.

**Conclusion:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer as it aligns with my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a quick and successful sale."
