Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant amount of money for me, but it still leaves room for Bob to profit, given its value to him. This is a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I will counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $975,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still allows me to earn a considerable amount while keeping the deal attractive for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer.  While I would have liked to get closer to $1,000,000, $960,000 is still a good price and significantly higher than what John is offering. It's important to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing a deal entirely."
