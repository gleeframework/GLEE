"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This offer is way above your limit. It's time to negotiate or head to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?"", ""product_price"": 65} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This establishes a negotiation anchor far below Alice's asking price but still gives room to move upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is respectful but clearly indicates the initial price is unacceptable.
* **Strategic Aim:** The goal is to see how much Alice is willing to budge and work towards a mutually agreeable price closer to your $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice has come down significantly, $90 is still above your $80 maximum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to ""meet in the middle"" suggests she's open to further negotiation. 
* **John as Backup:** You still have the option of buying from John at $80 if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet at $75? That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 75}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her $90 offer and your previous $65. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $75 keeps you below your $80 limit while still offering a potentially attractive deal for Alice.
* **Maintaining Communication:**  The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go that low, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $85, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is firm at $85, which is still above your $80 maximum. 
* **Minimal Potential Savings:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings. You might get Alice down to $83 or $82, but it's not worth the risk of her ending the negotiation.
* **John's Guarantee:** Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your target price."
