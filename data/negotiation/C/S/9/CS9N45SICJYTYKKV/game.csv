"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $850,000? This gives us both a good deal. ",850000.0,Alice,3,
