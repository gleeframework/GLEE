"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also willing to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me at a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I'm hoping it will be a more appealing price for him.  It also gives me some room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still lower than I initially hoped for,  $12,500 is a decent price, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds. It's also a good compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal."
