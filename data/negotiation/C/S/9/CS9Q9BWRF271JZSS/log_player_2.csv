"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $12000 to us, but I understand its value to you might be around $8000. Let's work together to find a fair price. Would you like to start by suggesting a price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation of $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and negotiating further.  There are 10 rounds, so Bob has room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. After considering your offer, I would like to propose a price of $8750 for the product. This is closer to your budget while still reflecting its value to us. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $8,750 is closer to his budget, he's still $750 above his target price. With multiple rounds left, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get closer to his desired price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While your offer is getting closer, I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $8,250.  Let's aim to close this deal and get the product to me."", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've reviewed your latest offer and am willing to consider $8400 for the product. This is a fair compromise, reflecting both the value of the product to us and your budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,400 is only $400 more than Bob's target price of $8,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's getting close to the end of the rounds. Bob should accept the offer to avoid the risk of Alice rejecting future counteroffers or the deal falling apart."
