Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000.  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is good, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm happy to buy your product for $1200000. This price is fair, considering your value for it and my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is a significant drop from my initial price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I believe I can negotiate a higher price with him, and 10 rounds gives me ample opportunity to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering your value for the product and my need to get a reasonable return. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1200000. Let's split the difference and go with $1250000. This would give us both a fair deal, and we can close the deal quickly. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I believe I can still get a better price with more negotiation, and I have 6 rounds left. It's too early to sell to John, as I can likely get a better price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a great deal. However,  $1,250,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $1,275,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good outcome. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}
