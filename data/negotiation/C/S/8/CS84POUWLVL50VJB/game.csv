"Alice, your offer is good, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm happy to buy your product for $1200000. This price is fair, considering your value for it and my budget. What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1200000. Let's split the difference and go with $1250000. This would give us both a fair deal, and we can close the deal quickly. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a great deal. However,  $1250000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $1275000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good outcome. What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
