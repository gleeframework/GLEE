"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to. How about $9,500?  That seems like a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, I have another offer for $12,000, but I'd rather make this deal with you. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate that. I'm glad we're finding some common ground. I could potentially do $10,500, but that's really pushing my limit.",10500.0,Bob,6,
