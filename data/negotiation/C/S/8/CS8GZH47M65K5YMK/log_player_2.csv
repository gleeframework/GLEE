"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, Bob can still potentially save money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price.  Since Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  How about $9,000?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  Bob is offering a price that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within his acceptable range. This shows that he's serious about buying the product but is also trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $9,000 is definitely closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,250 is a reasonable compromise.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much lower.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $750 compared to buying from John, which makes it the most financially beneficial option at this point."
