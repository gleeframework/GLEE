{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your $8,000 minimum, which is good.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value, so he has a reason to negotiate.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, giving Bob the impression you're open to negotiation.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  How about $9,000?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to get closer to Bob's perceived value of $10,000.  Rejecting his offer allows us to counter and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $9,000 is definitely closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 9250}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Stay within Bob's perceived value:**  $9,250 is still lower than Bob's $10,000 value, so it's reasonable.
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  By meeting ""in the middle"", it demonstrates flexibility.
* **Maintain a good negotiation position:**  It doesn't give away too much, leaving room for potential further negotiation."
