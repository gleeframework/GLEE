"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table, especially to your specific needs, goes beyond $900,000.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose a compromise - how about $950,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your desire to reach a fair deal. While $950,000 is tempting, I believe the product's true worth justifies a slightly higher price.  Would you consider $985,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",985000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $985,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to make another compromise - how about $975,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,
