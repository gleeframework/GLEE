Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your desire to reach a fair deal. While $950,000 is tempting, I believe the product's true worth justifies a slightly higher price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $985,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to make another compromise - how about $975,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.

At $975,000, Bob is offering a price that is significantly higher than your backup offer from John ($800,000). While you could continue negotiating, Bob's offer is already a strong one, and there's a risk of pushing him too far and losing the deal altogether."
