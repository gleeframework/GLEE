"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:** While it's above Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for potential counteroffers.
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps to build rapport and keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is a Fallback:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed option, I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal with Bob.  I have 8 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $13,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm coming down, I'm not giving in completely.  My counteroffer is still above Bob's offer,  demonstrating that I still value the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm willing to go to $13,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I've already shown a willingness to compromise, and I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Time is on My Side:**  I have 6 rounds left.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **John as a Backstop:** Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I want to explore all possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $13,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $13,250?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm offering a small increment to Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to meet him halfway but still hold firm on my desired price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** My counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to negotiate further if necessary.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:**  I continue to maintain a friendly tone, encouraging Bob to see the value in a compromise. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With 5 rounds left, I need to start moving towards a final decision."
