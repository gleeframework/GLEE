"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $13,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm willing to go to $13,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. ",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $13,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $13,250?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
