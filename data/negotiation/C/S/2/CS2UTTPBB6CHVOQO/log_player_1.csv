"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep the price closer to $12,000. Can we work towards a mutual agreement within that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent amount, I can likely get closer to my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $12,500 for the product. This is a step closer to my desired price while still acknowledging the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is still below my ideal price point, it's closer than Bob's previous offer, and I'm running out of time.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation, potentially leading to a lower price or even a failed deal. Additionally, continuing to negotiate could lead to the risk of Bob walking away completely or needing to sell to John, which would be less favorable than this offer."
