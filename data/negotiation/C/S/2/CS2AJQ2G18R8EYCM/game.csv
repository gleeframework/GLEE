"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
