"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'd like to propose a starting price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $9,500 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  This product offers you significant value, and I need to see a price that reflects that. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, as I think that's a fair price for the product's value to me.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I can't go as low as $9,750.  This product is a real game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000 even?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll propose $9,750 again. I think it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",9750.0,Bob,6,
