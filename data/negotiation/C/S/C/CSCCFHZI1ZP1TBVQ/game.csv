"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good deal while still saving me some money.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
