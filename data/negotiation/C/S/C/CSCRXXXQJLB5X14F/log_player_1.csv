"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer matches John's price, it's still early in the negotiation. There's room to try and secure a better deal with Bob before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm looking for a price that more accurately reflects the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,750,000 is the right number. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be reasonable about the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still losing potential profit compared to John's offer. It's worth another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle this at $1,675,000? That's a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1675000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,675,000 is the right price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,550,000. I'm getting closer to my target, but I need to make sure I'm not overpaying for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is now only slightly below John's guaranteed price. It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a significantly better outcome, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of losing both offers."
