"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still give you a great deal, and it's a price I can reasonably accept.  Let's try to find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10125.0,Alice,5,
