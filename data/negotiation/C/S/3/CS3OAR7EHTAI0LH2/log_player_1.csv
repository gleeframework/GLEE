Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This leaves you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's a round number:**  This makes it easier for Bob to process.

I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and emphasize my willingness to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still give you a great deal, and it's a price I can reasonably accept.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go a bit higher.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10125}
