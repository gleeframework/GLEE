"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've shown interest in. My asking price is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd be willing to accept to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  $175 is still below John's offer, giving me some flexibility.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly tone makes the negotiation more pleasant and helps build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for negotiation:** While I'm not willing to accept his offer, it shows he's interested and there's room to negotiate.
* **Opportunity to improve:** I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. Would you be interested in that?"", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $160 is a compromise between my starting price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $160 is still above my minimum price of $150, leaving me room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  ""Appreciate your interest"" and ""willing to come down"" keep the conversation positive and open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of losing John:** While I'm not willing to accept his offer, I'm getting close to the point where selling to John might be more appealing.
* **Final counteroffer in the next round:**  I'll make a final counteroffer in the next round. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to make one last concession. I can offer the product for $150. This is the lowest I can go, as it's my minimum price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final counteroffer, as it's my minimum price. 
* **Emphasize the minimum:**  I'm clearly stating my minimum price to signal that further negotiation is unlikely.
* **Decision time:** I'm giving Bob a clear choice - accept my offer or risk losing the deal.
* **Prepare to sell to John:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $145. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $145 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.
* **No further negotiation:**  I've already made my final counteroffer and don't want to continue negotiating downwards.
* **Risk of further haggling:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lower price and more time wasted.
* **Sell to John for a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $150 ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids further risk of a lower offer from Bob."
