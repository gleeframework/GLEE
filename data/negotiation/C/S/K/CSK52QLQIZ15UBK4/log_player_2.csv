"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This is a significant price, but I'm confident you'll see the value in it. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to John for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
