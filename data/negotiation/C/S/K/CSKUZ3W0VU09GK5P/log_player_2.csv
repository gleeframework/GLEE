"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a very fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $9,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $12,000.
* **Good deal for Bob:** While Bob wants to save as much as possible, this price is a significant improvement from the initial $10,000 and only $500 more than his counteroffer.
* **Limited time and rounds:**  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time or ending up with a worse deal than the current offer. 

It's a good deal for Bob, and accepting it secures the product while staying within his budget."
