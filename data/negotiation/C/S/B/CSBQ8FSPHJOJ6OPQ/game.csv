"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your own desire to sell. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my own minimum requirement. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant step closer to your offer.  Let's work together and find a solution that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
