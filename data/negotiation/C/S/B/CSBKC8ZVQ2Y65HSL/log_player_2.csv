Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $110? It's a great price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good compromise. It's within your budget and a decent price for a unique product.  While you could potentially negotiate further, there's always a risk Alice will walk away.  It's better to secure a good deal than risk losing the opportunity entirely."
