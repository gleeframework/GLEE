Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, which encourages Bob to counteroffer if he's not happy with the initial price.

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter his offer, keeping in mind my minimum of $80 and John's offer as fallback options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $95 is better than my minimum of $80, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $120.
* **Potential for a higher price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $80 as a backup gives me the flexibility to be more firm in my negotiations with Bob.

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer with a price higher than $95 but lower than $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective.  While $95 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $105?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate that the price is still a good deal for Bob, highlighting the potential benefits of the product.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a friendly and open tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

This strategy balances the need to get a good price with the desire to maintain a positive relationship with Bob.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to further adjust my offer, keeping in mind John's offer as a backup option."
