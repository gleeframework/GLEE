``` 

This offer sets a high starting point, but it's still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. It leaves room for negotiation, allowing us to potentially earn more than the minimum acceptable price of $8,000. We'll see if Bob accepts or counters!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $7,500 for the product. It's a great price, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $8,000. We're not desperate to sell and can potentially get a better deal. We'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good price for a product worth $8,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $8,000. We're confident we can negotiate a higher price and aren't desperate to sell, so we'll continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,800 is still a little too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to go down to $8,200. This is a great price for both of us, and it allows us to both walk away happy with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $7,900 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting close, we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and are starting to run out of time.  We're not sure we can get him any higher and we are already below the value of the product to us. We also don't want to risk ending up with nothing if we keep rejecting and he walks away.  At this point, selling to John for $8,000, which is our minimum acceptable price, seems like the best option to avoid further negotiation."
