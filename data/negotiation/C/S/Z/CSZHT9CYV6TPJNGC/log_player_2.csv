Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $750000 is a fair offer, I'm still confident in the product's value and need to ensure I receive a price that reflects that.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.
