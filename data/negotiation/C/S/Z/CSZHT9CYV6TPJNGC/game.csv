"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit steep at $1000000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. Can you consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $750000 is a fair offer, I'm still confident in the product's value and need to ensure I receive a price that reflects that.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
