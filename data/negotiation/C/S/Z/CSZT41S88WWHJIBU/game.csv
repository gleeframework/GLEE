"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $6,800. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",6800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $6,300?",6300.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $6,900. That's the minimum I can accept. Can you meet me at $6,900?",6900.0,Alice,5,
