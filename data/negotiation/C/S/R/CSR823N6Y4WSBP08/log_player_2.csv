"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $150 by me. Given its high quality and unique features, it's worth more than what you're willing to pay ($120). Considering this, I'm offering it to you at a special introductory price of $135. This is a great opportunity to own a product that exceeds your expectations at a price slightly above what you're comfortable with. I believe you'll find the value it brings to be well worth the investment. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.
