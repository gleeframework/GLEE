{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $100, but I'm willing to be flexible to secure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $80.  I will counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $70 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $85 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'd like to make a sale, $77.50 is still too low for me. I'm not willing to accept anything less than $80.  I will counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $77.50 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $82.50, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about $80? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $80 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's a good deal considering his perceived value of $80 for the product. It's a good compromise and a win for both of us."
