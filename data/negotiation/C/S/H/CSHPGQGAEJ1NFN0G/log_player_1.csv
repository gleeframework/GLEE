"Round 1

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,300,000 is a good amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation.  I'm not going to sell to John yet, because there's still potential to get a higher price from Bob."

{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway again by offering $1,300,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as it is a fair compromise and we're running out of time."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, but $1,200,000 is still too low.  I'm going to try to counter and push for a higher price. Even if Bob rejects my counteroffer, it gives me more information to help decide whether to sell to John or continue the negotiation."

However, it's also a significant drop from my last offer, signifying that we're close to the end of the negotiation and I'm willing to be more flexible.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting close to my floor price, I'm not willing to settle for $1,150,000 yet. I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price, and I have a few rounds left to try.  It's a risky move, but I'm going to counter and see what happens."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't close the deal with Bob at a higher price, it's better to take the $1,000,000 from John than risk getting nothing from Bob if we don't come to an agreement in this final round."
