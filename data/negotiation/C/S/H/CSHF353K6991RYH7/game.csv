"Alice, your offer is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer,  $1,350,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,425,000.  Let's finalize this deal.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
