{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly below what Bob is willing to pay, leaving some room for negotiation. It also frames the offer in a way that emphasizes the value for Bob, making him more likely to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is the same as what John would pay, I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer. There's still a chance I can get closer to my desired price of $11,500, and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer is manageable since John is a guaranteed sale at $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 for the product. This is still a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get a good return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
