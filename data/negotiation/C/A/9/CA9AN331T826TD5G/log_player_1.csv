Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $160. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential earnings. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to build Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $140 is better than nothing, I can still potentially get a better price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $140 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for.  How about $150?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to sell it without having to go through the hassle of finding another buyer."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is willing to go up to $130, which is closer to my minimum, I'm still not entirely satisfied.  The risk of further negotiation isn't worth it.  I'll take the guaranteed $150 from John."
