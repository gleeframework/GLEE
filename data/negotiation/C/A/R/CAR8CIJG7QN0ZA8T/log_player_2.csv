"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you and we're confident it will meet all your needs. Let's make this a win-win situation. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good discount, I'm aiming to save as much as possible. I'll start by rejecting the offer and see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $75 for this product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we consider the product priced at $80? This still offers a discount compared to its value, while ensuring we both benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $80, which is a good price for me. It's still a significant discount, and I'm confident it's the best I'll get from Alice.  I'm not willing to risk losing the deal with her and going to John, as that's the full price."
