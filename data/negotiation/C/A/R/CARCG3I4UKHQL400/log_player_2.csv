"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal price of $120. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit above my budget. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his budget and a good compromise.  It's also within the 10-round limit, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price."
