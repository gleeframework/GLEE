"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get closer to $18,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $17,500.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial target, I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, we might not reach a deal.  $16,500 is a decent profit, and it's better to secure the sale than to risk losing the deal altogether."
