Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Start with a price higher than both your minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for the highest possible profit.
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000. This gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed as a suggestion, indicating willingness to negotiate.  This might encourage Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, rather than a flat refusal."
