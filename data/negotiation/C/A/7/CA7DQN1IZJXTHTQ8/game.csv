"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,400,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $1,125,000?  That's right in the middle of our last two offers.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value to me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
