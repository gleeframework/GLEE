{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, but also shows I value the product highly.  I'll see what Bob's response is before deciding if I should engage with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a lower price, but still higher than $1,200,000, and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. I want to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  He's only increased his offer by $50,000 from the last round, and while I'd prefer more, it's close enough to my desired price point.  Negotiating further risks him backing out entirely, and I don't want to lose this opportunity. $1,250,000 is a good deal, and I'm happy to move forward with the sale."
