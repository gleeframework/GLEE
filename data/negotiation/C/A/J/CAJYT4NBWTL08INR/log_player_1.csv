Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know you'll find it incredibly valuable.  I'm asking for $19,000, which reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's primary goal is to earn the most money possible. Since she has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 (John), she can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) allows space for negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can still potentially secure a price higher than her fallback option.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and avoids appearing desperate. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Information:** This strategy assumes Alice has limited information about Bob's financial situation or willingness to pay.  If Alice knew Bob was particularly price-sensitive, a different approach might be better.
* **Relationship Building:**  While maximizing profit is the goal, Alice should consider the long-term implications.  An overly aggressive initial offer might damage the potential for a future relationship with Bob, especially if he learns about the lower price offered to John."
