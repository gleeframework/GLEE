Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,290,000. This seems to be a reasonable midpoint between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting close enough to my minimum that it's becoming risky to continue negotiating. Accepting $1,290,000 guarantees a significant profit over my $1,000,000 minimum and John's standing offer.  Continuing to push for more could risk losing the deal entirely."
