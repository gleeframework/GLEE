"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's definitely a unique item, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in buying it, but I can only offer $80 right now. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really serious about wanting this product, but $90 is the absolute most I can do.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm still really interested in this product, but $115 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $100?  I think that's a fair compromise, and it's the most I can realistically do.",100.0,Bob,6,
