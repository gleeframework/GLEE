"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle and I sell it to you for $160? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $100. Let me know what you think!",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $140. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: how about we meet at $155? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think!",155.0,Alice,5,
