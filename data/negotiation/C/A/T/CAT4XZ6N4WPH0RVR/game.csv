"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you offering this product to me. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82.50.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $82.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $80?",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still negotiating! I'm willing to meet you at $80, but I'd like to add a small premium for the convenience of a quick sale. How about we meet at $81?",81.0,Alice,5,
