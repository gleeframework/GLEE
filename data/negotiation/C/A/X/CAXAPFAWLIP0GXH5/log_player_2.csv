"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer. It's also worth exploring what Alice's counteroffer will be before potentially buying from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This offer is a good starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Reasonable offer:** $1,050,000 is a fair offer, as it's still a good deal for Alice, who values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Building rapport:**  The message emphasizes appreciation for Alice's willingness to negotiate and sets a friendly tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to make a living, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your offer, but it's still higher than what you're comfortable with. It's worthwhile to see if you can negotiate further before potentially locking in at $1,075,000 or buying from John.  There's a good chance you can get a better deal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,060,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good return on your investment while also giving me a great deal on the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's offer and your previous offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and demonstrates that you are serious about getting a deal done.
* **Justification:** The message includes a reason for your counteroffer, highlighting the fairness of the price for both parties. This helps to build rapport and make your offer more persuasive.
* **Finality:** This offer could be considered a 'final offer,'  but it's open to negotiation. It's important to be prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't accept a price you're comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1080000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come up slightly from her previous offer, but it's still not low enough. It's getting close to the point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of the deal falling apart or Alice getting too stubborn. 

You've already successfully negotiated down to a reasonable price, but you can't be certain that you'll get a better offer from Alice. Buying from John for $1,000,000 provides a guaranteed deal and avoids further risk."
