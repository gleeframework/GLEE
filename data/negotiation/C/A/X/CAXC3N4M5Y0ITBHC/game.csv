"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $950000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000. Would you be willing to consider my revised offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
