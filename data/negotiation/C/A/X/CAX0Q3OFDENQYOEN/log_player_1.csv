Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than the $15,000 floor I've set for myself. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

While I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price, Bob's last offer is getting too close to my minimum. To avoid the risk of further negotiation lowering the price even more, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
