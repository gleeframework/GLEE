"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very reasonable price. What do you think about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than what John is offering, her message tries to inflate the product's value to you.  You know your maximum price is $120. By rejecting this offer, you can see if Alice will come down further, getting you a better deal."
