"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sure this product is unique, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,500,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I believe the product holds. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget.  How about $1,100,000? This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to make a deal. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
