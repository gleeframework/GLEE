"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
