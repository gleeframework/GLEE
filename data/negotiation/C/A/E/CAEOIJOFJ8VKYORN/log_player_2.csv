"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far above his budget and there are still 9 rounds left to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, I believe my initial offer is closer to the true worth of this product considering its long-term benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $17,000 is still above his budget, and he has 7 rounds left to negotiate a better price. He can likely get a better deal with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product."", ""product_price"": 14000}
