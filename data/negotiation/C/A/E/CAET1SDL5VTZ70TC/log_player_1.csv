Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as you'd still make a good profit, and I'd get a great deal.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  This would allow you to get a good price for your product and would be a great deal for me.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."
