"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $900,000. That's my final offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
