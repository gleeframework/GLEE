"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product is valuable to me, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price is fair considering your value for the product and my own budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $925,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This price is a fair compromise, considering your value for the product and my budget.  I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that still reflects the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
