"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its features and value, I'm asking for $20,000. I think it's a fair price, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far above his budget and he knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John. It makes sense to start negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, $17,000 is still higher than his budget. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a lower price from Alice. He knows he can always buy from John for $10,000 if he doesn't get a better deal."
