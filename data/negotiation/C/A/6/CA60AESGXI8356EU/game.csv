"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this investment will yield significant returns for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,300,000 is far too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $800,000.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can drop to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This represents a considerable investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective needs. Let's work together to find a solution.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer demonstrates serious interest, and I value that. While $1,200,000 is a significant jump, we're still apart. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the true value of this unique product and my desire to strike a fair deal.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're making progress.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it offers.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
