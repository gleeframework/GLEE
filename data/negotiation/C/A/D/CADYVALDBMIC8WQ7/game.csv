"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $10000. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $13000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about my costs. How about we compromise at $12500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $12000. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,6,
