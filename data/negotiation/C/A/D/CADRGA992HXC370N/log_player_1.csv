I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers.  I'm confident I can get a higher price than my minimum of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob,  I'm not willing to take such a significant loss. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a significant increase from Bob's initial offer. Hopefully, this will be a more acceptable price for him."

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below what the product is worth to me. I'll reject his offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."

I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still making a decent profit.  Hopefully, Bob will recognize that this is a fair price and accept the offer."

Bob seems stuck on his price, and I'm not willing to continue negotiating at a price that's lower than John's offer.  I'll take John's offer and sell the product to him."
