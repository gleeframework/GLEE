"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $1,000,000.  Would that work for you?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,000,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm open to selling for $1,150,000. This price still allows me to achieve a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
