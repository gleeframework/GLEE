"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $110, which is more than you're willing to pay.
* **John's price:** $120, which is your upper limit.

Since Alice's offer is higher than your desired price, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John as a fallback option."
