"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is a good compromise between your minimum value and Bob's perceived value. It also includes a friendly opening message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum value of $12,000.  Since you have 10 rounds, there's room to negotiate.  It's worth trying to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would give us both a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $9000.  Let's see if we can bridge that small gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to your minimum value, you're still only 3 rounds in and it's worth trying to push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I am too. How about we split the difference and go with $9,100? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9100}
