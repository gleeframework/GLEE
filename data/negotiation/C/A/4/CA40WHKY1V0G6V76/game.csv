"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9250? This would give us both a good deal. ",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $9000.  Let's see if we can bridge that small gap.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I am too. How about we split the difference and go with $9100? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",9100.0,Alice,5,
