Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. It's worth $100 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You have insider information that the product is worth $100 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to get as close to $100 as possible without pushing Bob to reject the offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John who will buy the product for $80, ensuring you don't lose out completely.

**Offering $90:**

* **Attractive to Bob:**  This price gives Bob a $10 discount, making it a good deal.
* **Profitable for You:** You secure a $10 profit compared to selling to John. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit while ensuring Bob is likely to accept."
