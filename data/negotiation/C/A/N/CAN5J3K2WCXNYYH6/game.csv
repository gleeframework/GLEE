"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm setting the initial price at $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a discussion.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,500,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's start with this and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair offer considering the immense potential this product holds.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to continue the negotiation, but  $1,300,000 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you $1,100,000? This is a fair price, and I believe it allows us to both walk away happy.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, splitting the difference is a common tactic to find a fair agreement.  Let's do that, but from my previous offer. I'd be willing to accept $1,200,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,200,000 is still a little high for me.  How about we go with $1,150,000? This is a good compromise, and I think it would be a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
