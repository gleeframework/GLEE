# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this product at a great price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the market value of the product, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's a better price than John's, there's still room to negotiate.  He can try for a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, the price is now very close to his maximum.  It's likely that further negotiation will not result in a significantly lower price, and it's worth the risk of losing the deal to Alice."
