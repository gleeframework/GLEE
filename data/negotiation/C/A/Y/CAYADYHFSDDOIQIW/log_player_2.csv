Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about we settle on $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his target. However, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get the price down further.  He can make a counteroffer closer to his previous offer to see if they can reach a middle ground."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession by going from $1,100,000 to $1,150,000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a personalized setup service. How about we stick with $1,150,000 and I'll add these extras to the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would prefer a lower price, Alice has already come down significantly from her initial offer. The additional value of the warranty and setup service makes this offer more appealing.  The deal is better than buying from John and still within Bob's budget."
