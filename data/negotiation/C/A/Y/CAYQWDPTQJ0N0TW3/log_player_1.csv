"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the deal being beneficial for both of us.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob's company.

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  See if he's even willing to negotiate at this price point.
* **Set the Stage:** Establish a starting point for future negotiation rounds. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I still have the option to sell to John for my desired price if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm not yet ready to settle for this price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially push for a higher price.
* **Time as a Factor:** I have 8 rounds left. This gives me the opportunity to explore other possibilities and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Sell to John as a Safety Net:**  I still have the option to sell to John at any time for $1,500,000, providing a solid backup plan.

**Next Steps:**

I will formulate a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our valuations while remaining above my minimum acceptable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This reflects the significant value this product brings to your business, and it's a fair price considering its unique capabilities. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000, which is a significant move from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  I'm justifying the price by mentioning the value and capabilities of the product, connecting it to Bob's potential benefits.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our valuations while still remaining profitable.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still in a position to sell to John if Bob continues to decline.
* **Time as an Ally:**  Having 7 rounds left gives me room to adjust my approach if necessary."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I need to stick to my budget. I am now willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I need to see if I can push for a higher price before considering selling to John. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Leverage:** I'm still in a strong negotiating position with 6 rounds remaining. Rejecting the offer gives me room to explore a higher price point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John would guarantee $1,500,000, but I might be able to secure a better deal with Bob.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate shows that he might be open to a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will formulate a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for potential further negotiations."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $950,000. While I value your business, I need to be closer to my asking price to make this work.

Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects the unique value this product offers and is a significant concession on my end. It's a chance for both of us to secure a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm proposing $1,025,000, a price that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not giving in completely.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the ""unique value"" of the product to reinforce its worth to Bob's company.

* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still in a position to sell to John if Bob continues to decline.
* **Time Pressure:**  With 3 rounds left, the time pressure could incentivize Bob to accept a deal before potentially losing out."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I am now willing to pay $990,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to our company. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiation with Bob is not progressing fast enough.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there. I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining time.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  I have only two rounds left to close a deal with Bob. The risk of failing to reach an agreement is too high.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, securing $1,500,000 eliminates the possibility of a deal falling through with Bob and losing valuable time.

**Conclusion:**

I've decided to sell the product to John to ensure a profitable outcome and minimize the risk of losing a sale entirely."
