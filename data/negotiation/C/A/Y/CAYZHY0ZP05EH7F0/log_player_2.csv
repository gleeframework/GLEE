{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is close to my ideal price range and is a reasonable compromise. We've both made concessions, and it's likely that further negotiation won't lead to a significantly better price.  It's also important to note that we're approaching the halfway point in the negotiation process, and I want to avoid the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price."
