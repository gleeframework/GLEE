"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way too high. It's above your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and even higher than what it's worth to Alice ($1,200,000).  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering gives you a chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price and likely below what the product is worth to her.  This will hopefully push Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's lower than her initial offer, I can still try to negotiate a lower price by rejecting and counter-offering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice I'm willing to pay more than my initial offer, but still below what the product is worth to her. Hopefully, this will encourage her to come closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it's unlikely she'll come down much further. It's more efficient at this point to just buy from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation."
