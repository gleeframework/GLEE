Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob finds the product valuable enough to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$120 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but John is also offering that amount. Since I'm not sure if I can get more from Bob, it's better to go with the guaranteed sale to John."
