**Reasoning:** Bob is stubbornly sticking around $1,075,000. It's time to show him we're serious about the $1,100,000 mark and willing to walk away. This might push him to meet our price in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has dropped back down to his earlier offer and doesn't seem willing to budge closer to $1,100,000. We've been firm and given him a chance. It's time to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk getting a lower offer or no deal from Bob in the remaining rounds."
