"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this offer reflects the true worth of what you'll be gaining.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price point represents a fair and reasonable offer for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,800,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
