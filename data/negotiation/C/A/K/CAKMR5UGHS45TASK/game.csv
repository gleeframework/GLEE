"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $125. This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,4,
