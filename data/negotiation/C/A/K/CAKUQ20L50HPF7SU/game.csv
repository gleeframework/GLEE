"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you too. Let's start with a price of $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100, which is my maximum budget. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway? I'll propose a price of $125. This respects your budget while still reflecting the value I see in the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still out of my price range.  I'm really only comfortable going up to $110.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Considering your offer, Bob, I think we can find a mutually beneficial solution. How about we set the price at $115? This is higher than your previous offer but still below my original proposal. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hesitant about $115, but I'm willing to go up to $112.  I'm really hoping we can close this deal, so let me know what you think.",112.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your flexibility, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. Considering your latest offer, how about we settle on $113? This is slightly above your offer but still within my comfort zone. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",113.0,Alice,7,
