Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial ""discount"" if he values the unique aspects of the product.
* **Open Communication:**  The message aims to initiate a conversation, inviting Bob to counter-offer and discuss the product's value further."
