# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my maximum budget of $120.  It's best to reject the offer and see if we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you reaching out. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $160. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $160 is still above my budget of $120.  While it's closer, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. John is offering the product at my desired price, so I will buy from him instead."
