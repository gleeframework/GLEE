"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer lower than your ideal price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:** While starting low, we don't want to insult Alice with an extremely low offer.  $85 is a significant drop from her asking price, but it's still above her perceived value of the product.
* **Polite and Open:**  The message maintains a polite and open tone, crucial for successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above your target. There's room for further negotiation, and you're not in a time crunch yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I could do $88, but that's really as high as I can go."", 
""product_price"": 88
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but only slightly. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate, but also firmness on getting a good price. 
* **Setting a Limit:** By saying ""$88 is as high as I can go"", we're setting a soft limit. This may encourage Alice to accept, knowing we might walk away soon.
* **Maintaining Politeness:** We want to keep the interaction positive and collaborative, even while negotiating firmly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $88 is just a bit too low for me.  How about $90?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Negotiating:** While $90 is getting close to acceptable, we're still in a position to negotiate. Alice is clearly willing to come down in price.
* **Leverage:**  We haven't shown Alice that we're desperate to buy the product, and we have the backup option of John. 
* **Time:**  Five rounds are gone, but we have five more. It's worth trying for a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you finding a middle ground.  I could meet you halfway at $89, but that's really the best I can do."", 
""product_price"": 89
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're signaling flexibility by meeting Alice halfway between our last offer and hers. This can often be a good way to finalize a deal.
* **Final Offer:** By stating ""the best I can do,"" we're adding a touch of finality, encouraging Alice to accept. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation window. While we still have time, making our position clear becomes more important."
