Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $750,000}

This is a reasonable offer, considering I need to make a profit. I'm willing to negotiate further if Bob is interested, but I'm hoping this initial offer will be a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $700,000. Since this is lower than my initial offer, I'll need to decide whether to accept it or not.

After considering the offer, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not willing to sell the product for $700,000, as it's still $50,000 less than its true value to Bob. I'll send a new counteroffer to try to get closer to the $800,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to pay $700,000, I'll try to get closer to the $800,000 mark. I'll offer the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $725,000}

This is a reasonable counteroffer, considering Bob's willingness to pay $700,000. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him and bring us closer to a deal."
