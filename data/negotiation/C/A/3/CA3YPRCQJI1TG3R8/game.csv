"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've mentioned.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000. This still leaves room for a good profit for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. Let's see if we can close this gap.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,300,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and it leaves room for a healthy profit for you. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
