Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000. This still leaves room for a good profit for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. Let's see if we can close this gap.
