"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $750,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $675,000?  I think that's a reasonable compromise.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $725,000. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise considering the product's value.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $725,000, but I'm not willing to go lower than that. I'm confident that the product's value will be worth it to you in the long run. Let's meet at $725,000 and make this deal happen.",725000.0,Alice,7,
