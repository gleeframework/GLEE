Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above your minimum ($100).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $99 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, but still ensures you make a profit.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes ""value"" to nudge Bob to focus on the product's benefits rather than just the price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you're secure knowing John will buy it at your desired minimum."
