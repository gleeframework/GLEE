"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as I am sure you can find another buyer willing to pay close to your asking price. Let's make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering its value and the potential returns it can bring. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to accept $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about the value of the product and my costs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
