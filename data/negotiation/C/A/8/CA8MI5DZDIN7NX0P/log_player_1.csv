"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,500 is too low for me, considering my minimum is $12,000, and I have a chance to get more from Bob.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair return.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter-offer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing that we're not too far apart.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $13,150 for the product. That's a fair price for both of us, and gets this deal done."", ""product_price"": 13150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $13,000 is a good deal for me, and I'm getting closer to my goal.  It's better than selling to John for $12,000, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher."
