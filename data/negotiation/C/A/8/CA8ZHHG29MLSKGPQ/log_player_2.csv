Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm offering Alice $100 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.  I hope she'll see that this is a fair price, considering the product is only worth $150 to her."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems like Alice and I aren't going to reach an agreement. I've already made significant compromises, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $125. It's getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product entirely. I'll buy from John for $100."
