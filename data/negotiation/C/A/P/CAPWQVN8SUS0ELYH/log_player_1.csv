Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $1,375,000. This reflects a point closer to the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1375000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still believe the product's value is closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.

At this point, Bob is unwilling to budge beyond the minimum value I've placed on the product.  It's not worth my time to continue negotiating for a potentially small gain when I have a guaranteed sale at my desired minimum with John."
