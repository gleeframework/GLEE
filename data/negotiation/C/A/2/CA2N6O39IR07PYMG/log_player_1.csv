{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. I'm offering a price higher than my minimum but still below the product's full value to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation, but it also shows that I'm serious about getting a good price. I'm also being friendly and encouraging in my message, which can help to build rapport and increase the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept an offer that undervalues the product. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $16,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows for some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm not ready to settle for that just yet. I will counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $14,250? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $14,000 is close to my minimum, it's still below my desired price, and I'm not sure how much more room there is for negotiation.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum, it's the safest option. It avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, and guarantees me a fair price."
