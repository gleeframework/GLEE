"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you and I value it at $15,000.  Let me know your thoughts!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a fair price considering our respective values.  Let's work together to find a solution.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but still a bit above my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,250 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise at $12,000. This price is a fair middle ground and I'm confident it will work for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
