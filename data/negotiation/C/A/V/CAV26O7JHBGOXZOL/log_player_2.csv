"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,000,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  He should try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

Bob should start by making a bold counteroffer.  Since Alice's initial offer was far above his budget, he should aim for a price that's significantly lower, leaving room for potential compromise. $700,000 is a substantial drop, showing Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and isn't afraid to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. He has time and options, so he should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

Bob should increase his counteroffer slightly.  $750,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing Alice that he's willing to meet her halfway but still staying within his budget. This move shows Alice that he is serious about the deal while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $850,000 is getting closer to his budget, it's still a significant amount more than he's willing to pay.  He has time and options, so he should continue negotiating to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob should make a final counteroffer at his maximum budget of $800,000.  This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but won't go any higher.  He's essentially making a ""take it or leave it"" offer. If Alice rejects, Bob can move on to John's offer and still get the product within his budget."
