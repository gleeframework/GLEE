,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm looking to spend closer to $90.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal for you considering the value it holds. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $92.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",92.0,Bob,4,
