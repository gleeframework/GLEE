"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really love. It's worth $120 to you, right? I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $120.  You have the leverage of knowing the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer will allow you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm looking to spend closer to $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal for you considering the value it holds. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but $95 is still above my desired price point.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement by continuing to negotiate.  I'll reject her offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $92.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92}
