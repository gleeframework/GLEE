"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,500. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a good profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above your maximum budget of $15,000. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice or explore other options."
