"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and yield significant returns.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $850,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while still providing you with a great deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've assigned to the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're at a bit of an impasse.  I value your interest and want to find a solution.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This reflects my desire to work with you while still acknowledging the significant value this product holds.  This is my final offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,
