"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $8,000 to you. Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is closer, but still a little high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. How about we split the difference at $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
