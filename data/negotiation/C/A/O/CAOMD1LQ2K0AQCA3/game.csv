"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
