"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $115?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
