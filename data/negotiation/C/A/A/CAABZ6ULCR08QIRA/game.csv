"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $850000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $900000? I think that's a sweet spot for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $875000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $875000, which would be $887500. Let's see if we can meet at this price point.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $875000 again, but I'm also willing to make a small concession to $885000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",885000.0,Alice,7,
