Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal at $1,150,000, I'm still confident I can get a slightly higher price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
