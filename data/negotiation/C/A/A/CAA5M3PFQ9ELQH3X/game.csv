"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately too high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $1,200,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to negotiate.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's intrinsic worth and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting both the product's value and your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,900,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm confident that $1,400,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
