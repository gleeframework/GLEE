(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $1,100,000. It's much better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

While $925,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get closer to your target."
