"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know if you're interested.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1250000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
