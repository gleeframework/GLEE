Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$130** is a good starting point. It's more than my minimum value ($100) and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message** is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** $130 is a good price for me and still leaves some room for Bob to negotiate.
* **Start the negotiation:** This sets the stage for further discussion and potential counteroffers.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I can still sell to John for $100 if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay $110. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than selling to John for $100, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $120 is a compromise, showing flexibility but still closer to my desired price point.
* **Friendly and encouraging:** The message remains positive, highlighting the value of the product for Bob and encouraging a deal. 
* **Maintaining a firm position:** While willing to compromise, I'm not giving away too much, leaving room for further negotiations if necessary."
