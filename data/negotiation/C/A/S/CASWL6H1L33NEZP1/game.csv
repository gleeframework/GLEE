"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  My product is worth more than $9,000, and I'm still open to selling it to you.  Let's try $10,500.  That's a good compromise and gives you a fair price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,250 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet at $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the sale.",11000.0,Alice,5,
