"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the product seems intriguing, $950000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $825000. However, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and still allows for a profitable deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $800000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
