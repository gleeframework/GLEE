"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $900,000
* **Your maximum willingness to pay:** $1,000,000
* **John's offer:** $1,000,000

Rejecting Alice's offer means you can buy the product from John for the same price you were willing to pay anyway. This saves you no money, but it also doesn't cost you anything extra."
