This is a much more reasonable price, considering my maximum budget is $8,000. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate from her initial offer."

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if she's willing to come down further."

Alice is still too high. I'm running out of rounds, and it's not worth risking losing the opportunity to buy from John at a fixed price. I'll take the safe option and buy from John."
