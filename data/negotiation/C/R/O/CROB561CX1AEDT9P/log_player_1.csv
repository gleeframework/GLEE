"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation.  Since I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, this offer allows for some margin while still being a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'd prefer to earn more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a better price than $12,500. While I could sell to John for $12,000, I'm hoping that continuing the negotiation with Bob will get me a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to offer $13,000.  This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial asking price. With five rounds left, I think this is a fair offer that might entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $12,750 is a decent compromise.  With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether.  It's better to secure a solid profit now than to continue negotiating and possibly end up with nothing."
