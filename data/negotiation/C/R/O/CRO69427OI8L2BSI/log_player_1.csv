{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, as I have another buyer willing to pay that amount. This sets a strong starting point and encourages Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price of $110, which is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
