Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum ($80) but gives Bob some room to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer, but I'll also have John as a backup option to ensure I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is a good compromise, and it's higher than my minimum selling price. Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
