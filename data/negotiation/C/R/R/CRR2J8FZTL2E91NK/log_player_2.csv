"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Since Alice's offer is your maximum budget, there's no room for negotiation. Buying from John at the same price guarantees the purchase without the risk of a prolonged negotiation process."
