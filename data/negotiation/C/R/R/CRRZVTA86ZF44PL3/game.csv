"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product sounds interesting, but I was hoping for a price closer to $150. Can we work towards a mutually beneficial agreement?",150.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $150 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $175?  This would still be a great price for you and allow me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",175.0,Alice,3,
