Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Aiming for Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 aims to secure a $2,000 profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the higher price without explicitly stating its worth to you. 

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, you will sell to John for $8,000 and not have a chance to renegotiate with Bob."
