Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $95. It's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly higher than your $80 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept anything below $80."
