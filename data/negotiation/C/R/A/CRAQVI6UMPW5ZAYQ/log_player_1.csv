Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price:** $1,400,000 is higher than your minimum of $1,200,000, so you're still getting a good deal.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $1,400,000 is lower than the $1,500,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.

This strategy allows for a potential back-and-forth negotiation, maximizing your chances of getting a price closer to Bob's valuation. If he rejects, you can always lower the price slightly or counter his offer. And if you're not satisfied with the negotiations, you can always walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your ideal price.  You're in a good position to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to your initial offer of $1,400,000. You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering rather than accepting his offer or settling for John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,350,000?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer balances a few things:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:**  You've acknowledged Bob's offer and are open to compromise.
* **Maintains your position:** You're not drastically lowering your price, but are showing flexibility.
* **Offers a reasonable compromise:** The $1,350,000 figure is a midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's, appealing to his sense of fairness.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can then evaluate if it's worth continuing to negotiate or if you should accept John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you consider $1,320,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to your ideal price.  You're only $30,000 away from your initial offer of $1,350,000.  It's unlikely you'll be able to squeeze out much more in further negotiations.  Accepting this offer ensures a higher price than John's and a relatively smooth closing of the deal."
