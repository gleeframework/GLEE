Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer sets a price that is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, giving you the potential for a higher profit. However, it's not an unreasonable price, as you can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000 if Bob declines. This strategy allows you to try for a better deal while minimizing your risk."
