"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $9,000.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it would bring me.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're serious about acquiring this product, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is the lowest price I can accept. I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $9,500? This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I can see that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can offer it to you for $10,000, which is the minimum I can accept. This is a very competitive price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",10000.0,Alice,7,
