"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement.  I understand its worth to you, and I'm confident we can reach a fair price that satisfies both our needs.  Let's discuss a price of $950,000. This allows you a significant gain while still providing me with a profitable outcome. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still quite high. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or sticking with your backup option (John). There's room to save money here."
