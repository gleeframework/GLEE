"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $90 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85. Let's see if we can find common ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $87.50. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit too high at $87.50.  Let's try $86.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",86.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $87.50 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $86 just yet. I'm willing to offer you a slightly higher discount and sell the product to you for $88. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",88.0,Alice,5,
