"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but her initial offer is already at $950,000, leaving a lot of room for negotiation. 
* **There's no immediate need to buy from John.** You have 10 rounds to negotiate with Alice, and rejecting the initial offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening counteroffer:**  I'm starting low, aiming for a significant discount from Alice's offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and sets a strong starting point. 
* **Considering Alice's value:**  While I want to save money, I'm aware that Alice's bottom line is $800,000. This offer is below her value, but it provides space for negotiation and a potential compromise. 
* **Room for compromise:** There's a significant gap between my offer and Alice's initial price, allowing for multiple rounds of counteroffers and a potential agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down:** Her offer is getting closer to my desired price range.
* **Further negotiation is possible:**  There's still room to negotiate. By rejecting, I can try to secure a lower price. 
* **No need for John yet:** I have time and can continue negotiating with Alice. Buying from John right now is not the most cost-effective option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to meet halfway.
* **Staying within my budget:**  My offer is still well within my budget and significantly lower than Alice's last offer.
* **Maintaining pressure:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and gives Alice a clear incentive to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. 
* **Close to my target:**  While I'd prefer a lower price, this offer is close enough to my target range that it's worth accepting. 
* **Risk of escalation:**  If I reject, there's a risk that Alice will increase her offer or become less willing to negotiate further. Buying from John would be a much worse outcome."
