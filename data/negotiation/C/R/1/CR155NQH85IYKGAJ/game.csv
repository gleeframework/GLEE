"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return. Would you consider $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,500,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  How about $1,350,000?  This would allow both of us to make a fair profit.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
