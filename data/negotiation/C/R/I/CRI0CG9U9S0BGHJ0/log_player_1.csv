Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?  It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $150. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a little more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference again - $135. This is a great price for a valuable product, and I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems unlikely that Bob will be willing to go any higher.  I'm going to sell to John for $150, ensuring I get the minimum profit I'm comfortable with."
