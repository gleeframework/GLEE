"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $13000 for it. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,16000.0
"I understand that $13000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to offer $14500. That's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",14500.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $15250? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",15250.0,Alice,5,,
