Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,100,000 is higher than the $800,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $1,100,000 is still above your minimum of $1,200,000, so you're not giving away the product for less than you value it.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for a back and forth where you might find a price that benefits both of you.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price. 

I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,050,000. This is a compromise that's closer to my minimum value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has continued to offer prices below my minimum value. While I could continue to counteroffer, I'm getting close to my breaking point. John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
