"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to maximize my potential earnings, so I'm starting with a high price, just below Bob's estimated value.
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation without immediately pushing Bob away.
* **John's offer as safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:** Bob's offer is lower than the value he places on the product, suggesting he's still willing to negotiate.
* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe I can secure a higher price than $8,500 by countering Bob's offer.
* **John's offer:** While $8,000 is a guaranteed sale, I'm not desperate enough to accept Bob's offer at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This is a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Still above Bob's offer:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial assessment of the product's value.
* **Test the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's willingness to pay closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress in Negotiations:**  While Bob's offer is still lower than my desired price, it's a significant increase from his previous offer, suggesting a potential for compromise.
* **Room for improvement:**  I believe I can still get closer to my initial price of $9,500.
* **Time and Rounds:** I still have six rounds left to negotiate, giving me time to push for a better price. 
* **John's offer:** Though a guaranteed sale, it's significantly less than what I believe I can achieve with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($8,750) and my previous counteroffer ($9,000).
* **Signaling Flexibility:** This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Pressure Point:** By offering a price just below $9,000, I'm putting pressure on Bob to make a final decision.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still confident I can achieve a better price than John's offer, even with this lower counteroffer."
