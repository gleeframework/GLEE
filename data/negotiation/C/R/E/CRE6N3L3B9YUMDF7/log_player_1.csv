Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but also shows him the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is still a decent price, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still staying above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still squeeze a bit more out of Bob. It's a risk, but I'm going to try for a final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to offer $900,000. This is my final offer, and it's right at the middle ground between my last offer and Bob's. I hope he accepts, as selling to John for $800,000 would be a significant loss for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I've already made my final counteroffer and there's no guarantee he'll budge. To avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing money, I'll sell to John for $800,000. It's not ideal, but it's the safest option at this point."
