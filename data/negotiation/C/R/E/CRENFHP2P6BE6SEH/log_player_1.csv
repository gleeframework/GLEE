Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I need to aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Confidence:** The message implies the product's value, which might make Bob more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on Bob's perceived negotiation style and the product's perceived value to him, other approaches might be more effective."
