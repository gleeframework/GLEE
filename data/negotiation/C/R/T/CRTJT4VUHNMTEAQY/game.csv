"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000,  which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This still gives you a significant discount on the value you place on it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000, which is closer to my budget and still a good deal for you. Let's aim for a final agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
