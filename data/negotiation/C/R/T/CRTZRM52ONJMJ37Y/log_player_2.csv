# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

{
""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of your product, that price point is a little too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $725,000?"",
""product_price"": 725000
}
``` 
This counter-offer achieves a few things:
* **Polite and Professional:** Maintains a good negotiating tone.
* **Acknowledges Value:** Shows Alice we understand the product's worth.
* **Significant but Not Insulting:**  The offer is well below Alice's asking price, but not so low as to be offensive.  It gives room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Starts the negotiation closer to our desired outcome, potentially allowing us to meet in the middle at a price that works for both of us."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am willing to adjust the price to $875,000. This still reflects the significant value and quality of the product, while being more aligned with your budget considerations. I look forward to your feedback on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice moved closer to our desired price range, $875,000 is still significantly higher than our alternative option with John ($800,000). There's room for further negotiation to try and get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm getting closer to what I can do, but $875,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  To be honest, I have an alternative option at $800,000.  If you'd be willing to come down to $775,000, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:**  We're now being more transparent about our alternative option without fully revealing our hand. This lets Alice know we're serious and have a viable backup plan.
* **Urgency:** By mentioning our alternative, we're adding a sense of urgency to the negotiation, encouraging Alice to consider our offer more seriously.
* **Fair Compromise:** We're splitting the difference between our previous offer and Alice's counter-offer. This demonstrates willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant saving. 
* **Clear Call to Action:** We're making it clear that $775,000 is our target price, and accepting that price will close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I understand your position and I'm willing to consider it. I am able to offer the product to you for $825,000. This price still maintains a good balance between the value of the product and your budget constraints. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but her offer of $825,000 is still higher than John's $800,000 price.  While it might be possible to negotiate Alice down a little further, it's unlikely she'll drop below $800,000.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of Alice walking away or the negotiation dragging on.  Buying from John ensures we get the product at the best possible price."
