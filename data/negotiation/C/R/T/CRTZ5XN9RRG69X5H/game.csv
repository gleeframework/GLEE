"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's close this deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $92. Can you meet me at that price?,92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your hesitance, but $92 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $96?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done.",96.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $96 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $90, which is $94. Can you consider that?",94.0,Bob,6,
