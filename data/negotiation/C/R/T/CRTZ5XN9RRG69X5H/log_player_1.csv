Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my target price.  $90 is still too low for me, but it's a good sign Bob is interested."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $92. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$92 is still a bit low for me, but I'm not willing to sell to John yet. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your hesitance, but $92 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $96?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done."", ""product_price"": 96}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $96 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $90, which is $94. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, I've already rejected several offers and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to get $94 now than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John at a lower price."
