"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $7,250? I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal work.",7250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $7,250 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $6,800? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",6800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try one more time. I'm willing to come down to $7,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",7000.0,Alice,5,
