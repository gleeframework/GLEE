"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you, and it leaves some room for negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair price that acknowledges its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, his counteroffer is too far off. I want to try and push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $1,250,000? This takes into account your needs and my value for the product. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer, but still a touch high for my budget. Would you consider $1,175,000? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. There are still rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'm also wary of accepting an offer that's still significantly lower than my perceived value of the product."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,175,000 isn't quite enough for me.  Let's aim for $1,225,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth while staying within your budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1225000}
