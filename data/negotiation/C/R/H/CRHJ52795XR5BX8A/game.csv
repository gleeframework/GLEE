"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair price that acknowledges its value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $1,250,000? This takes into account your needs and my value for the product. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer, but still a touch high for my budget. Would you consider $1,175,000? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,175,000 isn't quite enough for me.  Let's aim for $1,225,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth while staying within your budget.  What do you say?",1225000.0,Alice,5,
