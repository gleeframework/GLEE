Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's a bit lower than I was hoping for, it's still above my minimum price and it's looking like he's unlikely to go higher. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for the minimum price."
