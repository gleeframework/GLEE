"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price. He knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, so he starts with his maximum offer. This is likely to be rejected by Alice, but it establishes Bob's position and starts the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and might lead to a lower price.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer slightly from $1,000,000, showing some willingness to compromise.  This offer is still below Alice's current offer of $1,150,000, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. He has already rejected an offer of $1,150,000. While $1,180,000 is a slightly better offer, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There are still 5 rounds left, giving Bob more time to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to Alice's price, but still trying to keep it under his maximum budget.  He has rejected two offers in a row, showing a strong desire to get a good deal.  By increasing his offer to $1,100,000, he is demonstrating flexibility, while still trying to maintain some leverage.  He's betting that Alice is willing to come down slightly further, especially with fewer rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the same as her initial offer from Round 1, which Bob rejected.  This indicates that Alice is unwilling to budge further.  There are only 3 rounds left, and the negotiation is likely to continue in a similar pattern. It's becoming increasingly likely that Bob will not be able to secure a better price. 

Given the limited time and the lack of progress, it's in Bob's best interest to secure the product from John for $1,000,000. This guarantees him the product at his maximum budget, saving him time and effort in further negotiation."
