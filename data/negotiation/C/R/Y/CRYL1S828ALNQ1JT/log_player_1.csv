"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves Bob some space to counter if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$7,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is still above my minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation, but it's also a significant increase from Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll continue to negotiate, hoping for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $15,000. This is my minimum value and I'm willing to accept it, but I'm hoping Bob will counter with a higher price.  If he doesn't, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$11,000 is still below my minimum value. I'll continue to negotiate, hoping for a better price or at least to reach my minimum with Bob. I'll still have a few more rounds to get to a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. It's also not too low that I'd be uncomfortable with a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is still a bit below my ideal price, I'm running out of time.  With only two rounds left, I don't want to risk Bob walking away and having to sell to John at my minimum.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
