Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the potential benefit for Bob.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not setting a hard price, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** If I can't reach an agreeable price with Bob, I have the option of selling to John for my minimum price. 

This approach allows me to explore further negotiation while ensuring I have a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $90 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal on the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** I'm countering with a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer.  
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** I highlight the ""meeting in the middle"" aspect to make it sound like a fair compromise.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:** I use a polite tone to encourage continued negotiation. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and hopefully close the deal without having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. Would you be willing to consider $100 as the maximum price for this product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum but still below:** While $100 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still a significant distance away.
* **Potential for a slight improvement:**  I believe I can still potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a reliable fallback:** If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for $150, guaranteeing my minimum profit.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation, hoping to get closer to my desired price while keeping the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $100, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $110. This is really my final offer, as it's getting close to my minimum.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Small Compromise:** I'm only dropping the price by $5, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to go significantly lower.
* **Emphasis on Minimum:** I'm reminding Bob of my minimum acceptable price to justify my offer and potentially sway him to accept.

This counteroffer aims to close the deal at a price closer to my desired profit while still leaving room for a potential acceptance from Bob. If he rejects, I'll sell to John."
