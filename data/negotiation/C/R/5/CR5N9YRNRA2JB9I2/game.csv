"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $2000000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $1500000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1750000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1600000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price, but I'm getting close to considering buying from John.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $1600000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $1550000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. If you're still interested, please let me know.",1550000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your final concession, Alice, but $1550000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to walk away from the deal and buy the product from John for $800000. I think that's a fair price, and I'm not willing to pay more than that.",800000.0,Bob,8,
