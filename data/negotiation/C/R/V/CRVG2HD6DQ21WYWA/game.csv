"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price we're both happy with.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could close the deal quickly.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think the product's value is worth more. I'll offer it to you for $11,200. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and what I'm willing to walk away from. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
