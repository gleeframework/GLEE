I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. Would you like to make an offer to purchase it?,9000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,9200.0
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, I'm still finding it a little high. How about we settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,9000.0
"I'm still not convinced that $7,750 is enough for the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to meet you at $8,250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",8250.0,Alice,5,,
