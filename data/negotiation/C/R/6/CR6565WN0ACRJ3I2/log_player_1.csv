Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, hoping to secure a good deal.  I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects the offer, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could accept his offer, it would result in a significant loss for me.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous offer, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm hoping this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that I'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm better off selling the product to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price and guarantees me a sale."
