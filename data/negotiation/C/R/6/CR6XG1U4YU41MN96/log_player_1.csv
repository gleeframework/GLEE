Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to him.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, you have leverage.  You should aim for a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that he'll automatically reject it.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and high demand, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:** You start by highlighting the exclusivity and desirability of the product.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,600,000 is above Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation if he's interested.
* **Justification:**  You vaguely mention ""return on investment"" to plant a seed of potential profit in Bob's mind without revealing your bottom line.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:**  You have a strong position. Don't be afraid to reject a counteroffer if it falls too far below your minimum. 
* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob might counteroffer. Be ready to adjust your strategy based on his response."
