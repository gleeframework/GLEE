"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  This product would be very valuable to me at around $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $11,500? That's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while working for me.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer the product to you for $13,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you at this price.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $12,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go.  It's a fair offer considering John is offering me the same product at this price.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to stretch your budget to $12,000, but I'm still not ready to accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can offer the product to you for $13,250. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",13250.0,Alice,7,
