"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $900000 is significantly lower than the value I place on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This price still reflects the product's unique value while being more competitive for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
