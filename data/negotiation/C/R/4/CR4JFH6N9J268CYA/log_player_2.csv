"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially save more by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  There's still room to bargain as Alice values the product at $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, while still being a reasonable price for Bob. This allows for room to negotiate further if Alice rejects the offer. It is also a good starting point for establishing a potential middle ground between Bob's desired price and Alice's valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than his initial budget of $1,200,000 and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there is a risk that Alice will further reduce her offer or reject any subsequent counteroffers.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
