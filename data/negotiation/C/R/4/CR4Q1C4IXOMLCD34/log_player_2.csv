"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your offer, but still reflects the product's value. How about $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,050,000, which is lower than John's price of $1,200,000, and he's likely not going to get a better offer from Alice as she's already come down from her initial price."
