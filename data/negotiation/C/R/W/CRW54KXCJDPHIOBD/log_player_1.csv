"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know Bob values it at, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I don't undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider something closer to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I could sell to John now, I'll try to negotiate with Bob a few more rounds to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I can afford to sell for.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 80}
