"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if I can get a lower price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider something closer to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** My message is polite and expresses that I'm interested but need a more affordable price. 
* **Targeting Below My Max:**  While my maximum budget is $80, I'm aiming lower to see if I can secure an even better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I can afford to sell for.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has met my maximum budget. There's no point in negotiating further, as I can't get a lower price from John."
