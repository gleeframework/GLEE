"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with a fair offer. How about $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $100 for this product.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** Starting with a much lower counter-offer ($100) leaves room for negotiation while signaling that Alice's initial price is unacceptable.
* **Polite and collaborative:** The message remains respectful and suggests a willingness to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your response. We appreciate your interest in our product. Given the value it holds for you, let's aim for a middle ground. How about $125 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Alice came down in price, it's still above her value ($120) and our target price ($100). There's likely room for further negotiation. 
* **Limited risk:** We're still early in the negotiation process. Rejecting this offer doesn't put us at significant risk of losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $112? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 112
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're moving closer to a potential agreement. Offering $112 is a significant jump from our previous offer but still allows for some negotiation.
* **Justification:** Framing the offer as a ""middle ground"" makes it seem more appealing and reasonable to Alice.
* **Time Consideration:**  We're getting closer to the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. Increasing our offer now shows we're serious about closing a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a price that works well for both of us. How about $118 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Movement:**  Alice only decreased her offer by $4. This suggests she's getting close to her limit, but we can likely push for a bit more.
* **Alternative Option:**  We still have the option to buy from John for $150.  While not ideal, it's a safety net if negotiations stall completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's really the best I can do."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're making a smaller concession this round ($3) to signal we're reaching our upper limit but still open to a deal.
* **Setting a Boundary:**  Explicitly stating ""best I can do"" adds a sense of finality, encouraging Alice to make a decision.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only a few rounds left, we need to increase the pressure to close the deal on favorable terms."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're making progress. Considering the value you place on the product, how about we settle on $116 for the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $116. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $116
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down to $116, which is a reasonable compromise. It's only $1 more than our last offer, and significantly less than John's $150 price.
* **Time Remaining:**  With only three rounds remaining, the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal compared to the risk of the deal falling through.
* **Successful Negotiation:** We've successfully negotiated Alice down from her initial offer of $140, saving $24."
