Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $12,000. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  This still gives you a great value, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I'm not quite ready to accept $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  It's a fair compromise for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
