"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  This still gives you a great value, and it's closer to my asking price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I'm not quite ready to accept $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  It's a fair compromise for both of us, and we can close this deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
