"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price of $120, but it still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly tone in the message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob (""perfect for you"") can make him more willing to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob is clearly interested, I can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** I can still choose to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  Offering $90 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Highlighting the value:**  Reminding Bob that it's still a ""good deal"" for him can encourage him to accept.
* **Focus on moving forward:**  The message emphasizes getting closer to a deal, creating a sense of momentum towards an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'd be willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my minimum price, $85 is still below my desired earnings.
* **Negotiation room:** We are only halfway through the negotiations, and I have more room to bargain. 
* **Potential for better offer:** I can try to push for a price closer to my minimum or even higher in the next rounds.
* **John's offer:**  Selling to John for $120 is always a safe option, but I still want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** Offering $95 shows a continued willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  The message emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" aspect, suggesting that this is the best price for both parties.
* **Call to Action:** The closing phrase ""Let's make this happen!"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $92.50 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $92.50 is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for Improvement:** Although it's getting close, I still have a few rounds to try and push for a better price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $120 is tempting, I'm still confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Possible Compromise:** I can counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $93.75 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 93.75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  Offering $93.75 shows a continued willingness to negotiate while staying closer to my minimum price.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  The message reiterates the ""fair price"" aspect, highlighting the compromise and emphasizing the benefits for both parties.
* **Urgency and Closure:**  The message emphasizes the importance of ""closing the deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiations with only two rounds left.
* **Low Return:**  $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm unlikely to get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds.
* **Safe Option:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I want to maximize my earnings, the risk of getting stuck with a lower price or no deal at all is higher than the potential reward."
