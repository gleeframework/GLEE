"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. $9,000 is a good price, but Bob can potentially get it for even less.  There's no need to rush into a decision when there are more rounds available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so he should start by making a significant counteroffer. $8,000 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and $8,500 is a good price.  There's no guarantee that Bob will get a better offer in the next round, and it's getting closer to his maximum budget. It's wise to secure the product at a good price rather than risk a counteroffer being rejected or a long negotiation."
