Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $125. It's a great deal for you, and it's still above my minimum price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:**  $125 is higher than Bob's valuation of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Below Alice's minimum:** $125 is above Alice's minimum of $150, allowing for potential profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates willingness to negotiate, keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below Alice's minimum:** $90 is significantly lower than Alice's minimum of $150. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he expressed interest in the product, indicating a willingness to negotiate.  
* **John's offer:**  Alice has a guaranteed alternative with John's offer of $150, which is a much better deal. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price closer to her desired range, while still having John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $110 for this product. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise, moving from $125 to $110. 
* **Above Bob's offer:**  $110 is still above Bob's offer of $90, but it signals a move towards a potential agreement.
* **Above Alice's minimum:**  While $110 is still below Alice's ideal price, it's significantly closer to her minimum of $150, making it a more acceptable deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message reiterates a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can we meet at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Alice's minimum:** While $105 is still below Alice's minimum of $150, it's close enough to be a reasonable compromise.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While this might not be Alice's ideal price, there's still the possibility that she could negotiate a higher price in future rounds if she rejects this offer.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed alternative:** Alice has John's offer of $150 as a safety net, giving her the flexibility to accept Bob's offer without significant financial risk.

By accepting Bob's offer, Alice secures a sale at a price that's above his initial offer and closer to her minimum. She can then decide if she wants to continue negotiating with Bob for a potentially higher price in the future."
