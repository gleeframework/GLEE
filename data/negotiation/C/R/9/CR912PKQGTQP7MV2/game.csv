"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, though, and I'm willing to pay up to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows me to acquire the product while staying within my financial constraints.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to close this deal. Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",900000.0,Bob,4,
