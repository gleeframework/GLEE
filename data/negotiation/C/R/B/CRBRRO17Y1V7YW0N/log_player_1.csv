Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a beneficial deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, Alice. However, I still believe that $750,000 would be a fair price for me. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $750,000, but this is still significantly less than John's offer of $800,000.  We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if he doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position, but I have another offer closer to my asking price. I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal quickly.  My final offer is $875,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to do business with you. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** We're getting close to the halfway point of the negotiations. Putting a time constraint (""final offer"") can encourage Bob to act.
* **Alternative buyer:** Subtly mentioning the other offer reminds Bob that we have other options and strengthens our position. 
* **Compromise (but not too much):** $875,000 is a significant drop, but it's still a substantial profit margin above our minimum and a good deal for Bob considering the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $825,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my financial situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $825,000 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and a good deal better than John's offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to push for a higher price might alienate Bob,  risking the deal altogether. It's better to secure a good profit now."
