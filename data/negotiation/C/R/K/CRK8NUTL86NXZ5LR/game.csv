"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. I believe that's a fair compromise, considering its potential.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and would be a fair price for both of us. Let's reach a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
