Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and would be a fair price for both of us. Let's reach a deal.

While Bob's offer now matches John's, there's no guarantee he'll go any higher.  Continuing the negotiation has a diminishing return, and I'm assured of the $1,200,000 from John."
