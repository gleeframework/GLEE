"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's below your $1,000,000 limit, it's still more than Alice values the product at. There's room for negotiation.
* **You have more rounds:**  There's no need to rush into a deal, especially with a higher offer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing you can buy from John for $1,000,000 gives you leverage to push for a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down:** She's moved from $900,000 to $875,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still room for improvement:**  $875,000 is still higher than your initial counteroffer of $850,000.  There's more room to push for a lower price. 
* **John's offer is still a safety net:**  You can still buy from John if the negotiation doesn't work out in your favor."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $875,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $860,000 for the product.  Let's close this deal and save some time and effort."", ""product_price"": 860000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $880,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:**  $880,000 is within your budget and a good compromise. 
* **Alice's final offer:**  She's stated this is her final offer, suggesting further negotiation might be fruitless.
* **Time is a factor:**  You've already gone through several rounds, and continuing to haggle might not yield significant savings.
* **John's offer is still available:**  You can always buy from John if you absolutely need the product, but it's a higher price.

It's a good deal for you at this point, considering your goal was to save money.  You've secured the product for less than your initial limit, and you have rounds left if something goes wrong."
