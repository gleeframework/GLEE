"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $875,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $860,000 for the product.  Let's close this deal and save some time and effort.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $880,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.",880000.0,Alice,5,
