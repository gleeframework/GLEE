"I understand that you're looking to get a better price, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to balance that with the value I place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm counteroffering at $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $825,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with. ",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, which is a bit above your latest offer, but still below my minimum. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",875000.0,Alice,5,
