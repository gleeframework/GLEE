"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties to collaborate. We're offering this exceptional product to you for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's way above his target price, and he can get the same product for $1,000,000 from John.  It makes sense to negotiate with Alice first, since he might get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. For this exceptional product, I am willing to negotiate at $1,250,000. This is a favorable price considering its value to you and our desire to facilitate a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, it's still above his budget.  He can get the same product for $1,000,000 from John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
