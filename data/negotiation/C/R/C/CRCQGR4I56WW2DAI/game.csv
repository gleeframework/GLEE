,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to move forward with a more reasonable offer. Considering our costs and the value we place on the product, how about we settle on $90 for the product? Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
