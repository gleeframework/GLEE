"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the product's true value is closer to my initial proposal. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $1,350,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider my previous offer?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
