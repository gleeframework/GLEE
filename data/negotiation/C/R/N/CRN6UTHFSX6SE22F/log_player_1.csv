"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $150. I think it's a great deal, considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm providing a brief reason for the price to make it seem more reasonable.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in subsequent rounds based on his counteroffer.  I also have the safety net of selling to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Negotiation:**  Bob's offer is my minimum, but there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $150. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $120, rejecting Bob's offer gives me a chance to potentially earn more.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than his offer, to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $135. This still leaves room for both of us to have a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial price of $150 but staying above Bob's offer of $120.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the higher price point.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm continuing to use a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage a successful negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to pay a bit more for the product. If he rejects, I'll further adjust my price in subsequent rounds based on his responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $135, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are already in round 4, meaning there are only 6 rounds left to close the deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of not reaching an agreement and having to sell to John for $120 is higher than the potential reward of a few more dollars.

**Decision:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit, even if it's slightly less than I initially hoped for."
