{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  It also highlights the value Bob would get by purchasing from you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $10,000 is above my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $15,000.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
