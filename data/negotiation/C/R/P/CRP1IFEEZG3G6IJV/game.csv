,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $6000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $7250. Can you consider this price?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7250 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $7875? I believe this is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",7875.0,Alice,5,
