"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to work with me. I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $12,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,250. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet me halfway, but $13,250 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  How about $12,750?  It's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know what you think.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $13,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13200.0,Alice,5,
