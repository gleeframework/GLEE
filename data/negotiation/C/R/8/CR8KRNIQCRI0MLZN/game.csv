"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a good deal for you, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This price is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,325,000 is a good compromise for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $1,337,500. This is the best price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
