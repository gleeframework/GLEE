Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price, knowing that Bob's maximum value is $1,000,000. It's unlikely he'll accept this, but it sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see if he's willing to pay closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,200,000, I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility, but still above Bob's initial offer. This should create a starting point for further negotiation while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I would like to receive.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer and is closer to Bob's latest offer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,020,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price and is significantly higher than his previous offers. It's a good deal for me and allows me to avoid the risk of a prolonged negotiation and the potential for a lower offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer seems like the most reasonable choice at this point."
