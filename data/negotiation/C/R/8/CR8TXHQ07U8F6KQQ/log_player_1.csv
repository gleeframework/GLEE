Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There is no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum value. This makes the negotiation tricky.

**Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the given numbers, you have two main options:

1. **High Anchor with Room for Negotiation:** Start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to anchor his perception of the product's worth. You can then offer ""concessions"" to make the final price seem more appealing.

2. **Direct Sale to John:** Knowing John will meet your minimum, you can forgo negotiating with Bob and sell directly to John.

**The Offer (Option 1)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its exceptional value and market demand, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further to find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Anchor:** The $1,900,000 price tag sets a high anchor.
* **Exclusivity:** Emphasizing ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Indicates willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he can get a better deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Rejection:**  Be prepared for Bob to reject your initial offer. Have a negotiation strategy ready with smaller concessions.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you prioritize a quick sale, going directly to John might be more efficient. 

**Option 2 (Direct Sale to John):**

If you want to avoid negotiation, simply sell the product to John for your desired $1,500,000.

**Remember:** Negotiation is about understanding both your position and the other party's. Be prepared to adapt your approach based on Bob's responses."
