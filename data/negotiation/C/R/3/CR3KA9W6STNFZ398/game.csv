"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $15,000 to you, and to be fair, I wouldn't sell it for anything less than $12,000. How about we split the difference and make it $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Could we meet somewhere in between?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, and I understand your budget constraints.  However, $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,750?",12750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I would like to stay within my budget of $12,000, I am willing to consider $12,500 if that helps us reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
