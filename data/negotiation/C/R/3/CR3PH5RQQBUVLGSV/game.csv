"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your initial offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
