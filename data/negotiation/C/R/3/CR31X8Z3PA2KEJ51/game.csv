"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $1,300,000? This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counter offer. $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $1,100,000? That would be a good compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,200,000? This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
