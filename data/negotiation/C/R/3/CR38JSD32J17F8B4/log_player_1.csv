Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) might seem too aggressive and could lead to an immediate rejection.

By starting at $14,000, Alice strikes a balance between maximizing her potential profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
