Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **High Anchor Point:**  This initial price sets a high anchor, making it more likely Bob will accept a slightly lower price if he tries to negotiate. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive, you might want to start slightly lower. However, the high value to Bob suggests he might be willing to pay a premium. 
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a strong relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly more generous offer could be considered."
