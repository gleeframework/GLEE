"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $140. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $145? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $145 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sticking to my offer of $140. If we can't agree on that, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",140.0,Bob,6,
