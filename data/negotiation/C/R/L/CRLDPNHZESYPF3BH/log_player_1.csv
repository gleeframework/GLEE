Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:**  $11,500 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and highlights the product's value while leaving room for Bob to counter. 

**Strategy:**

By starting at a price slightly above Bob's valuation, we incentivize him to make a counteroffer.  We're prepared to accept a price closer to his valuation if it means securing a sale. However, we're also prepared to walk away and sell to John for our minimum price of $12,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to do $10,500?  That's the absolute most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to our minimum, it's still below our desired range.  We need to keep pushing for a better price, especially since we have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000. 

**Next Steps:**

We'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $11,500.  This will show Bob that we're willing to negotiate, but also that we won't settle for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** $11,000 is a compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer, but still above his maximum. This shows flexibility while maintaining our goal of earning a decent price.
* **Message:** The message is polite, acknowledges Bob's offer, and reiterates the value of the product to justify our counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

We're trying to find a middle ground. This counteroffer might convince Bob to accept or push him to make a final counteroffer. If Bob rejects again, we'll have to decide whether to accept his final offer or walk away and sell to John."
