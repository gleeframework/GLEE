,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
