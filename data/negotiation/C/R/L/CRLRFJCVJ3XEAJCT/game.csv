"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $1,050,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price, but $950,000 is still not enough. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,025,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $980,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise.  If you can go up to $1,000,000, we can close this deal.  This is my last offer before I consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $1,000,000. I've already told you that's my limit is $980,000. I'm not going to go any higher. I'm starting to think I should just buy it from John.",980000.0,Bob,8,
