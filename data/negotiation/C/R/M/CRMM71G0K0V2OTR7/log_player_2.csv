"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Alice's offer is $1,100,000, which is still within Bob's budget. However, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since Bob knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there is still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best possible deal, but he also wants to avoid prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily. By offering $1,050,000, Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, while still leaving some room for further negotiation.  This offer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves Alice with a profit margin. It's a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,080,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price.  It's likely that Alice is getting closer to her minimum acceptable price, and further negotiations could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
