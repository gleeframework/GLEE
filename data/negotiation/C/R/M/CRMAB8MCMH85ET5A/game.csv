"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Based on my research, I believe the product is worth around $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the product's value, however, my initial pricing reflects the true worth and potential this product offers.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This is a significant reduction and a fair offer considering the quality and potential return on investment.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $19,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,500. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to understand this product's true value.  I'm willing to make one more significant move and offer it to you for $16,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the long-term benefits you'll gain.",16500.0,Alice,5,
