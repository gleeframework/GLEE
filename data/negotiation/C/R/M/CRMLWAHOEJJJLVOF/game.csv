"I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $14,000 is a fair reflection of its value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we settle on $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
