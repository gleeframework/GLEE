Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a good compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I don't want to settle too early."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $920,000 is getting closer to my target, I still feel I can get a better price.  There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can push for a more favorable deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle on $935,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 935000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I was hoping to get a higher price from Bob, we've reached a point where it's clear he's not willing to budge much further. With only a few rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob and potentially getting a lower counteroffer is too high.  John is offering my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that certainty."
