Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, which is above Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows me to make concessions if necessary, while still making a profit. 
* **Protecting my minimum:** I'm still above my minimum price of $120, so I'm not losing money.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
* If negotiations with Bob stall, I can always fall back on John's offer of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  I can still try to get a better price by making a counteroffer. I have room to negotiate since John is willing to pay $120. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my ideal price point. 
* I'll keep in mind that I have a backup option with John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  While I appreciate your offer, $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'd be willing to accept $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer close to my minimum:** My counteroffer of $110 is still above my minimum price of $120, but it's closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone,  emphasizing the ""split the difference"" approach to make it sound like a fair compromise.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm not giving up on my goal of getting closer to $120, but leaving room for Bob to potentially accept.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll have made a successful deal, albeit slightly lower than my initial goal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess whether to make another counteroffer or accept John's offer of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is showing flexibility, his offer of $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation reaching a stalemate:**  We're stuck in a stalemate, and further negotiation with Bob might not lead to a better outcome for me.
* **Secure alternative:** I have a reliable backup option with John who is willing to pay my minimum price of $120.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him, ensuring that I get my desired price and don't risk wasting more time negotiating with Bob."
