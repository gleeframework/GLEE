Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to consider my costs and the value I bring to the table.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,200. I'm willing to come down to $9,800, which is a significant concession from my initial price. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800

It's time to cut it off. Alice is very unlikely to go below $9,500, and even then, you're only saving a small amount. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000.  You're better off securing the product now rather than risking a stalemate with Alice and potentially losing out."
