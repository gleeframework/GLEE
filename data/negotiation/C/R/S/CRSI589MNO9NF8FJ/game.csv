"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000 for your product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my original proposal. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,400,000 for your product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $1,400,000 is still significantly less than the product's true value, especially considering its benefit to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000. This price is fair to both of us, and it allows us to close this deal amicably. Let's work together to find common ground.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts in negotiating, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,450,000 for your product.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $1,450,000 is still a significant distance from where we need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and it represents the absolute minimum I can accept.  If you're truly serious about acquiring this product, I urge you to accept this offer.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
