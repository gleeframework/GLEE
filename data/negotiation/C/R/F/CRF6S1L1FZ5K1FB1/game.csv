"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $800000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm happy to discuss further, but I won't go below this price.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to ensure I make a sufficient profit. I'm willing to meet you at $790000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",790000.0,Alice,5,
