"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This ensures you'll see a great return on investment while reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but so is my budget.  I can go up to $700,000 today, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering John is offering something similar.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't sell this product for less than its true value. Let's find a middle ground: $1,000,000. This acknowledges the value while still offering you a significant return on your investment. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but still have a way to go.  I can increase my offer to $750,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering I have other options available.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, I have other potential buyers showing strong interest, but I believe in giving you a fair chance. My final offer is $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's more than reasonable given the value you'll receive.  Let me know your decision soon so we can both move forward.",950000.0,Alice,7,
