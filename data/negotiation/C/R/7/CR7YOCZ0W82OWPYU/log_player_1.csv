Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but so is my budget.  I can go up to $700,000 today, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering John is offering something similar. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's increasing offer:** Bob's offer is slowly increasing, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial offer.
* **John as leverage:** Bob mentioning John is a negotiation tactic to pressure Alice. Alice can use this to her advantage, but shouldn't immediately give in. 
* **Time remaining:** Still having 6 rounds left provides room for further negotiation.

Alice should aim to understand how high Bob is willing to go before considering John's offer or settling for a price below her target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't sell this product for less than its true value. Let's find a middle ground: $1,000,000. This acknowledges the value while still offering you a significant return on your investment. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** It's crucial to hold firm on the $1,000,000 valuation, as this is Alice's minimum acceptable price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer gauges Bob's seriousness. If he's willing to meet in the middle, it shows strong interest. 
* **Time Consideration:**  With 5 rounds remaining, there's still room to negotiate if Bob rejects this offer.  However, moving closer to the minimum acceptable price increases the pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer but still have a way to go.  I can increase my offer to $750,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering I have other options available. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:**  While Bob is increasing his offer, the increments are small and don't reflect a sense of urgency on his part.
* **Leveraging Time:**  Alice still has 4 rounds left. Continuing to reject offers that are significantly below her minimum might push Bob to make a more serious offer. 
* **John's Offer:** Holding onto John's offer ensures Alice doesn't have to settle for a price far below her target.

**Strategy Going Forward:**

* **Next Counteroffer:** Alice should consider a smaller decrease in her counteroffer, potentially around $950,000, to signal some flexibility but maintain firmness on the overall valuation. 
* **Deadline Pressure:**  As the rounds progress, Alice can subtly introduce a sense of urgency, implying she might have to explore other options soon if they can't reach an agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, I have other potential buyers showing strong interest, but I believe in giving you a fair chance. My final offer is $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's more than reasonable given the value you'll receive.  Let me know your decision soon so we can both move forward."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is her ""final offer,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency and signals she's serious about moving on if necessary. 
* **Slight Concession:** The $950,000 price point shows flexibility while still holding reasonably close to her minimum.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning other buyers and requesting a decision soon adds a subtle deadline, prompting Bob to act."
