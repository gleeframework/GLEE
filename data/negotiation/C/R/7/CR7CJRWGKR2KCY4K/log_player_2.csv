Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,250,000 is a fair offer, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $1,350,000? It still gives you a significant value, and it's closer to my desired price point. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.
