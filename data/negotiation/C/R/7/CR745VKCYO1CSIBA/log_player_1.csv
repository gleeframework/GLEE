Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is more than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It signals your willingness to negotiate:**  By starting slightly lower than Bob's potential value, you show flexibility and make it easier for him to counteroffer. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still quite a bit below what you'd like to get.  Since you know he's willing to pay more, it's worth trying to get closer to your desired price.  By rejecting his offer, you can counteroffer and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need for the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $12800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,800 is only slightly below your initial counteroffer of $13,250, and it's significantly higher than your minimum of $12,000.  It's also higher than John's offer of $12,000.  This is a good deal, and it's likely that you won't get a much better offer from Bob. It's time to take the profit and move on!"
