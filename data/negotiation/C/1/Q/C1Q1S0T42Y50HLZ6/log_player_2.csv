"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially worth far more than $1000000. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product yet, I'm confident it has the potential to be a game-changer. I'm willing to let you have it for a price of $1500000.  This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a chance you won't want to miss. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for the exact same price as John. Since you know you can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting her offer keeps your options open."
