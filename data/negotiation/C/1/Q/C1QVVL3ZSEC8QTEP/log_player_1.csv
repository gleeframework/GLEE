Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and slightly above what I believe Bob is willing to pay ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a positive and friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By setting a price slightly higher than what Bob values the product, I'm anticipating a counteroffer and leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Option to Go to John:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $100, which provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my floor of $100. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed $100 offer from John, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's current offer.  

I'll proceed to the next round and try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $95? It's a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make it work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation constructive.

I'm confident that $95 is a fair price that both Bob and I can agree on. It's above my minimum and closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I can go up to $95. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Middle:** Bob's offer of $92.50 is very close to my minimum of $100.  
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** While I could potentially counteroffer again, it's likely that further negotiation would be time-consuming and might not result in a significantly better offer.
* **Time is money:** I don't want to risk losing Bob's interest or wasting time when I have a guaranteed offer of $100 from John. 

Accepting Bob's offer is the best option to secure a deal quickly while still being close to my desired price."
