"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's above your minimum and still below my maximum. Let's make a deal!",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable accepting $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. It's a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to pay $8,750.  This would still leave you with a healthy profit, and it's a fair compromise that could close the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your target price, and I'm willing to meet you closer to it. I'm going to counteroffer the product to you for $9,200. It's a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,
