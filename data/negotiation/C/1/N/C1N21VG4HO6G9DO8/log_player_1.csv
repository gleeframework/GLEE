{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer allows for a potential profit of $15, which is a good starting point, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to be flexible and potentially come down a bit if Bob counters with a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $105? I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  This is the absolute most I can afford. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $108 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John."
