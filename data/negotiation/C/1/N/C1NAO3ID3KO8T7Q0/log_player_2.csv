"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** Even though Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, Alice's offer of $12,000 saves him $3,000.
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  While John's offer is still within Bob's budget, it's not the most economical option."
