"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think you'll find very reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's a good deal for you compared to Alice's perceived value, you can do better. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $950,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price. You can try to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal. If Alice continues to be inflexible, you can always buy from John, who is willing to sell at your desired price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This price is still below your initial price and allows for a profit for you, while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's close, it's not worth risking further negotiation to potentially have her reject your counteroffer again. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price."
