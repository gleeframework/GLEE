"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me and would be a great deal for you.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $950,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This price is still below your initial price and allows for a profit for you, while staying within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
