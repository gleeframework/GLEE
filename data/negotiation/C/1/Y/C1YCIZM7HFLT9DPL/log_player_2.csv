"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  This would still be a good profit for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's serious intent to negotiate.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message highlights the potential profit for Alice while also emphasizing the fair price for Bob. 
* **Realistic Expectation:** $10,000 is still a good deal for Bob, leaving room for potential compromise without jeopardizing his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows you to get a great deal while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has come down from her initial offer, and $11,500 is within Bob's budget.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 7 rounds left, continuing to negotiate risks reaching the 10th round and being forced to buy from John at a much higher price. 
* **Good Deal:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, $11,500 is a good price considering his goal of saving as much money as possible."
