Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you would be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **No Specific Details:** I don't give Bob any specific details about the product, as this might give him leverage to drive down the price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I've made a successful sale.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and try to negotiate a price that's still profitable for me.
* **Stalemate:** If we can't agree on a price, I'll stop the negotiation with Bob and sell the product to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I might be able to get closer to my desired price by rejecting his offer and counter-offering.
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:** Selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, but I don't want to settle for the bare minimum if I can potentially get more from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's offer and formulate a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, but still attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $7,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** I keep the tone friendly and encourage further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:**  Great! I've achieved a successful negotiation.
* **Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his next offer and decide whether to accept, counter-offer again, or sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8000?  This feels like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **No further negotiation:**  There's little room for further negotiation, and trying to push for a higher price risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Avoiding risk:**  While I could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of Bob walking away and me having to sell to John at the same price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
