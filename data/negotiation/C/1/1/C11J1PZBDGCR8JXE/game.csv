"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what it can do for your business. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,080,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1080000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,080,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $990,000? I think that's a fair offer.",990000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings.",1040000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  While I see the value in the product, I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,010,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
