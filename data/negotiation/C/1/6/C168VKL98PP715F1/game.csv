"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. I understand the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This would allow us both to walk away with a profitable deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is the maximum I can afford for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
