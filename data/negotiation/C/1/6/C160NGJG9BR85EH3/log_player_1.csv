Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $100 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $80.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John.

Offering the product at $95 gives Bob a chance to get what he perceives as a $15 discount, while still netting me a significant profit. If he rejects this offer, I'm not losing anything because I can sell it to John at my desired price."
