"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to its value to you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $8,500 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,000? This would still allow you to get a great deal on the product, while also giving me a price that's fair for me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I think that's a fair compromise that would work for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
