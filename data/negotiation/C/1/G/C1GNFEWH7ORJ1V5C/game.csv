"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested, but unfortunately $11,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm ready to pay $9,000.  This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 is your best offer, Bob, but I'm still looking for a good profit margin. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a good profit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,250, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",9250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I understand that $9,250 is a good offer. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,750. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,7,
