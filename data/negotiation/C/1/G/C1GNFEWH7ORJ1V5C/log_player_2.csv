"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $11,000 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested, but unfortunately $11,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm ready to pay $9,000.  This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is your best offer, Bob, but I'm still looking for a good profit margin. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  While $9,500 is closer to his target, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can reach a price closer to his budget. If the negotiations fail, he can always choose to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a good profit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,250, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I understand that $9,250 is a good offer. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,750. This is my final compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He has already made several counteroffers and Alice is unwilling to go lower than $9,750.  At this point, Bob is only two rounds away from needing to buy from John, so it's better to cut his losses and purchase the product for $8,000 from John rather than risk ending up with a higher price."
