Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in the product.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

While I could push for more, accepting at $975,000 is a strong deal. It surpasses my minimum and leaves a significant profit. Continuing carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me having to settle closer to my baseline."
