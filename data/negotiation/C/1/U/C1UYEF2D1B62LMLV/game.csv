"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,500,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,850000.0
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $650,000. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind. What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,775000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to $700,000, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",775000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, you're right that we both deserve a fair deal. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $750,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,800000.0
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. As you know, I have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet my price, but I need you to meet me at $800,000. If not, I'll have to consider selling to John. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,7,,
