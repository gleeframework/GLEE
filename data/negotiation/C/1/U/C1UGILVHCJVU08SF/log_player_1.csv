Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product which I believe would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, it's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  The $20,000 offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest. If he flat out rejects it, you can always come down.  If he counters, it means he's seriously considering it. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John's offer, but don't mention it to Bob. Having a backup buyer strengthens your position but revealing it might make Bob less willing to negotiate. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can always adjust your price downwards during the negotiation, keeping in mind your $15,000 minimum."
