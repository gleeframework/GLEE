"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a competitive price. How about $120?  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While the product is worth $150 to you, Alice's offer of $120 is still significantly more than its value to her ($80). 
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup.**  While you want to save money, you have a safe option if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $100 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This price still leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your price.**  Her offer of $110 is significantly better than her initial $120, and it's within the range of what you're willing to pay.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it.**  While you could try to push for a lower price, the potential savings might not be worth the risk of losing the deal or wasting more time.
* **Buying from John is still an option.**  If you're not happy with Alice's final offer, you can still buy from John.

**In summary:** Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice in this round. It gets you the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation that may not be fruitful."
