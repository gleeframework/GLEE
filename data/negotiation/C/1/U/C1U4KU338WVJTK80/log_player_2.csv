"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially negotiate a better price."

* Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget of $1,500,000 and represents a better price than John's offer.
*  It's also closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $1,300,000, indicating potential for a deal. 
* Accepting the offer saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John."
