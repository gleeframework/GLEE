"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm sure you'll find it incredibly valuable.  My initial price is $1,400,000. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too far off from what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,300,000? This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it reflects my desire to reach a fair deal with you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you consider $1,175,000? This offer represents a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $1,175,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference â€“ $1,250,000. It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
