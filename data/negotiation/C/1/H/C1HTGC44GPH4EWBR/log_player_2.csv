Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too far off from what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,300,000? This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it reflects my desire to reach a fair deal with you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $1,175,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference â€“ $1,250,000. It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You're getting a significant discount:**  You're buying the product for $250,000 less than John's price and $150,000 less than Alice's initial offer.
* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by splitting the difference between your previous offer and hers. This suggests she's motivated to close the deal. 
* **Limited rounds:** You only have 5 rounds left, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better offer from Alice, especially as she's getting closer to her minimum acceptable price."
