"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $107.50? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $107.50.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $106?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $106. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, though. How about we try $108? It's still a good price for me, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me.  I'm confident we can reach a deal at $107.  It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  This would be a great final offer for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",107.0,Bob,6,
