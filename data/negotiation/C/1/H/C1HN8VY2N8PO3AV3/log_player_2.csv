"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your ideal price point. There's room for negotiation, and it's better to try to secure a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,300,000.  This would allow us both to gain from the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your ideal price, but there's still some room to negotiate.  By rejecting the offer, you can potentially secure a lower price in the next round. It's still too early to consider buying from John, as you're making progress in negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,250,000 is still not quite meeting my needs.  How about $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise that allows both of us to come away with a good deal. Let's finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is very close to your ideal price point, and you've already made significant progress in the negotiations.  Accepting this offer allows you to buy the product for a good price, and it's better than risking further negotiation with Alice or resorting to John's more expensive option."
