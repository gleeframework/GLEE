"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value item. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to offer you $8000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8000 is below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique item. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $12000. If this is still not acceptable, I'm open to further negotiations.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value I'm placing on this item, I'm willing to go up to $9500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to go down to $11500, which is still a bit above my minimum price. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to finalizing the deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
