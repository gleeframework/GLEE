Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I see the value in this product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,075,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $980,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but we're still above John's offer. It's worth another round of negotiation to try and secure a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is about the highest I can go. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Bob has met John's offer. There's no further room for negotiation with Bob, and it's unlikely we'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting Bob's offer now ensures we get the best possible price."
