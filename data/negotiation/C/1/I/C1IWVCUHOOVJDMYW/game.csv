"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to my original offer of $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000?  This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which is $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
