"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
