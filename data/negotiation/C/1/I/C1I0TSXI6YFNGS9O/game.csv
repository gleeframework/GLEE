"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you counter-offering. That said,  $600,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product has tremendous value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. Perhaps we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to move down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my price point. Would you be willing to consider $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. To show you I'm serious, I'll come up to $750,000.  That's my final offer.",750000.0,Bob,6,
