Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has indicated that $750,000 is his final offer.  While we're getting closer, it's clear he's unwilling to even approach our $1,000,000 minimum.  We have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale to John."
