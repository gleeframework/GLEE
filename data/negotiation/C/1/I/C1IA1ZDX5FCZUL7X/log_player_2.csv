Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at her stated value for the product, which means she is likely to not go lower.  This is the best deal I can get from Alice, and it's within my budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's risky, and I could end up paying more with John."
