"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $150 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $130. This is a good price, but Bob can likely get it for less by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $115? This would still be a good deal for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I am able to offer it to you for $125. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $125 is within Bob's budget and a decent price.  While there's a chance Bob might be able to get it for a bit less with further negotiation, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal and having to pay $150 to John."
