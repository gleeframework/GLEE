"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  To be candid, $1,200,000 falls significantly short of what I can accept.  Could you consider a figure closer to $1,350,000? This takes into account the true worth of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is getting closer, but to be completely transparent, I have a hard limit at $1,300,000. If you can meet that, we have a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
