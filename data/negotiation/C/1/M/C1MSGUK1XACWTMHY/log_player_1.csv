Considering its true worth to you and the market value, I propose we set the price at $100. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle, ensuring you get a fair deal while also compensating for the value the product holds for you personally. Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Given its worth to me, I'm willing to pay $85. This would give you a good profit margin, while still allowing me to afford the purchase. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
