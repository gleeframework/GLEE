"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true worth to you and the market value, I propose we set the price at $100. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle, ensuring you get a fair deal while also compensating for the value the product holds for you personally. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.
