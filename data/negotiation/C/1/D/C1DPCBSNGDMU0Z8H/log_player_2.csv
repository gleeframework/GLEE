Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the value of this product.  How about $1,175,000? This offer is fair and allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we split the difference at $1,162,500?  This feels like a fair compromise that respects both our positions.  Let's get this deal done.

Alice is clearly committed to meeting in the middle, and this offer is a good price compared to John's. There's a risk Alice's offers will start going back up, and it's unlikely further haggling will yield a significantly better deal.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
