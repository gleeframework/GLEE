"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That seems like a fair price to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $75, which would be $82.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",82.5,Alice,5,
