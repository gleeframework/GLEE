"Dear Bob,
I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe would significantly enhance your endeavors and bring substantial value to your business. This product, while valued at $1,000,000 by you, holds an even greater significance to me, as it represents a unique asset that has been meticulously crafted to meet the highest standards of excellence.

I am offering you the chance to own this product at a special introductory price of $900,000, which I believe is a fair and generous offer considering its true worth and the benefits it can provide to you. This offer is exclusive to you and is valid for a limited time only, as I am also prepared to sell it to another interested party, Mr. John, for $1,500,000.

Please let me know if you are interested in discussing this further, and we can arrange a meeting to explore the details and possibilities of how this product can contribute to your success. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you and contribute to your business's growth.

Best regards,
Alice",900000.0,Alice,1,
