"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $8,200? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",8200.0,Alice,5,
