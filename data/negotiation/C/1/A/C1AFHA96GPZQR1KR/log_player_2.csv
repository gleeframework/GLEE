# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and you can try to secure a better deal.  Since you have a fallback option with John, it's worth trying to get closer to your target price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,100,000?

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is closer to your desired price point and within your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might harden her stance or you could end up paying John's higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without risking a longer negotiation."
