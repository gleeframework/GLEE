"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer given the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. This offer reflects the product's worth to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $14,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your counteroffer. This is the best I can do for now.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I hope we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to make a profit, and $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm hoping we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which I believe is a fair price considering the value to me. This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground and close this transaction.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck in a loop, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you $13,250, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product.",13250.0,Alice,7,
