"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm proposing a price of $6,500 for the product. This is a competitive price considering its worth, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",6500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $6,500 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $6,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",6000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $6,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $5,500? I think that's a fair price that reflects both the value and my budget.",5500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence in finding a price that works for you. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to ensure I'm not losing too much value. I'm proposing a new price of $5,750. This is a slight compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me halfway.",5750.0,Alice,5,
