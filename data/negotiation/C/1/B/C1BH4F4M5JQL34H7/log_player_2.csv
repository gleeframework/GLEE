"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm proposing a price of $6,500 for the product. This is a competitive price considering its worth, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $6,500 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $5,000?"", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $6,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $6,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $5,500? I think that's a fair price that reflects both the value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 5500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence in finding a price that works for you. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to ensure I'm not losing too much value. I'm proposing a new price of $5,750. This is a slight compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good price and Alice is clearly trying to find a middle ground.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better result."
