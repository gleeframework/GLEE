Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is lower, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value and potential,""  you subtly remind Bob that the product is worth a significant amount, even if he doesn't personally value it at $1,150,000.
* **Gauge Interest:** The open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer, giving you more information to work with. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer, so there's less pressure to accept a lowball offer from Bob."
