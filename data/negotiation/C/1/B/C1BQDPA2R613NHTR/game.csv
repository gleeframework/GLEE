"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your feedback. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1050000. I'm willing to compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $980000. I think this is a fair price that takes into account the value I see in the product.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that's closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1050000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some additional value, such as a 3-month warranty and dedicated support. This is my final offer on the price, but I'm willing to negotiate on the extras. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the added extras, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $1000000. I'm willing to consider the warranty and support, but I think the price should reflect the value of the product itself. I'm counteroffering at $980000, and I'm willing to accept the warranty and support as part of the deal. What do you think?",980000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're not on the same page. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1080000, and I'll throw in a 6-month warranty and dedicated support. This is my last offer, and I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product.

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go above $1000000. I'm willing to accept the 6-month warranty and dedicated support, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm making a final counteroffer at $1000000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1100000.
