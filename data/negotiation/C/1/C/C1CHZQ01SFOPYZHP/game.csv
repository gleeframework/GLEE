"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair and competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $650,000 to you. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be open to $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
