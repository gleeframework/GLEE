"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my profit.
* **Positive Messaging:** I'm using positive language to frame the offer as a good deal for Bob.
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob, hoping to sway him towards acceptance. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the message leaves room for negotiation, signaling that I'm open to finding a middle ground. 

This strategy aims to test the waters and see Bob's initial reaction while leaving room to adjust my price throughout the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Avoiding Selling to John Yet:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, but I'm still aiming for a higher profit if possible. I want to explore Bob's willingness to compromise further before settling for that amount."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering you the product for $16,000. This price reflects the value you'll receive from the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while demonstrating my willingness to be flexible.  
* **Value Justification:** I'm linking the price to the value Bob will receive, reinforcing the product's worth.
* **Mutual Satisfaction:**  I'm emphasizing the benefit for both of us, fostering a collaborative tone.
* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  I'm increasing the price from Bob's offer, but not by a drastic amount, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and keeping the negotiations open to reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room to negotiate upwards.  I'm not yet willing to settle for $14,000 because I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can push Bob a little further.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices and potentially secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm happy to continue working with you.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from it. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering my absolute minimum price, acknowledging Bob's budget while also sticking to my bottom line. 
* **Win-Win Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the benefits for both of us to create a sense of mutual gain and encourage Bob's acceptance. 
* **Closing Tone:**  I'm using a confident and encouraging tone, signaling that I'm ready to close the deal at this price. 

This counteroffer aims to close the gap with Bob and finalize the deal, while still achieving my minimum desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate risks reaching a stalemate, especially with only a few rounds left. 
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a profit that meets my minimum requirements and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, securing a guaranteed profit with John is the most sensible decision at this point. It minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely and ensures that I don't waste any more time with Bob."
