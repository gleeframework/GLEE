# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is quite high ($950,000). While you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, you can likely get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price. This might lead Alice to propose a counter-offer, or you can proceed with purchasing from John for $1,000,000."
