Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal and I believe you'll find great value in it."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible, which is the price John is willing to pay. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I want a high price, starting at $12,000 exactly might discourage Bob. Offering it slightly lower leaves room for him to potentially negotiate up.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not mentioning John directly, there's an implied sense that if Bob doesn't take the deal, someone else will.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
