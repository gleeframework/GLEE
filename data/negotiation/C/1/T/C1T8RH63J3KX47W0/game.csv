"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $18000 for it. It's a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $12000? It's still a good price considering the value of the product to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15000. This would still be a good deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a similar product at this price.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
