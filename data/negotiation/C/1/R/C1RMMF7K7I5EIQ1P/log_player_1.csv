Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal to someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since the product's worth to Bob ($10,000) is less than its worth to me ($10,000 floor), there's room for negotiation and potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a higher price ($15,000) leaves space for negotiation if Bob counters. It also anchors the value higher in his mind.
* **Alternative Guarantee:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000 provides a safety net. I won't accept anything less than that. 

**Important Considerations:**

* Bob's negotiation style is unknown. I might adjust my strategy based on his response.
* This initial offer assumes I have some flexibility in pricing and am willing to negotiate."
