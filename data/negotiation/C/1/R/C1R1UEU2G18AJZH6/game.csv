"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? I think that's a fair compromise.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,4,
