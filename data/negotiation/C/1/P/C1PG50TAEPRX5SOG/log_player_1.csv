Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest.  I want to leave room for negotiation, but also establish a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this will encourage Bob to continue negotiating and reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing him as a buyer entirely, and  John is a guaranteed sale."
