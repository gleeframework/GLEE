"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $140? ",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $140 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $155?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $155 is still a bit high for me. How about $145? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase it then.",145.0,Bob,4,
