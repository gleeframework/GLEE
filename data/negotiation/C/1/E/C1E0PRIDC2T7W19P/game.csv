"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product truly is significant.  I could consider coming down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
