"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $10,000 to you, and we're looking to sell it for $9,500. We believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and our costs. Let us know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is quite high. It's much closer to my maximum budget than her minimum selling price. I should counter-offer significantly lower to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $6,000. Would that be something you'd consider?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. Considering your budget constraints, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose to sell the product for $7,000. This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, there's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject this offer and propose something closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $6,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. In order to reach an agreement, I would like to suggest a price of $6,800 for the product. This still leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is negotiating in good faith and has come down significantly.  $6,800 is a reasonable price, well below my maximum and a good savings. It's time to close the deal."
