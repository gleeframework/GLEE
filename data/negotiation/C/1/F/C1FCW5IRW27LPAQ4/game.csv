"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $10,000 to you, and we're looking to sell it for $9,500. We believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and our costs. Let us know if this works for you!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $6,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. Considering your budget constraints, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose to sell the product for $7,000. This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $6,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. In order to reach an agreement, I would like to suggest a price of $6,800 for the product. This still leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction.",6800.0,Alice,5,
