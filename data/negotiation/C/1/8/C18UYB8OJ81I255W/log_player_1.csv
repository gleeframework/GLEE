Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals and Bob's valuation:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering it at $12,000 or close to it risks Bob rejecting the offer outright. By offering a price noticeably lower than Bob's perceived value, Alice increases the chances of a successful sale. 
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $10,000 with John, so any offer above that is already profitable.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the sale goes through."
