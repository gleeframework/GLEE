"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get to a fair price, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go quite that low. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",10800.0,Alice,5,
