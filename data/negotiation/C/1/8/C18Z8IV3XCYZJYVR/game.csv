"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This price is fair to both of us, allowing for a reasonable profit for you and a valuable acquisition for me. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,2,
