"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 1200000 is a stretch for you, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price closer to 1000000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at 1000000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1000000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on $800000. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 800000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you halfway between 1000000 and 800000. Would you be willing to consider 900000?",900000.0,Alice,5,
