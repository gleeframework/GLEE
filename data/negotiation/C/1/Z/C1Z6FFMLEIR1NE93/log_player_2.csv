Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm afraid $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll consider selling the product to you for $6,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $5,500 is a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $6,200. It's the highest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $6,200. Accepting this offer saves $1,800 compared to John's price.  Continuing to negotiate might save a bit more, but the risk of Alice walking away and losing the deal is higher now."
