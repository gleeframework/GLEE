"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $950,000? I believe that's a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's very close to the middle ground. How about $1,025,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway to reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
