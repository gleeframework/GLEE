"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price of $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should see if he can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be open to negotiating a price closer to that range?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10000, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than John's price of $15,000. 
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject any further counteroffers, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* It's a good compromise, and Bob can save a decent amount of money by accepting."
