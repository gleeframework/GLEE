"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000.  I think it's a fair deal considering the value it brings.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer. While $850,000 is tempting, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $875,000. Would you be open to that?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $875,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but only to $900,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  To be honest, $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500.  It's a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can make this work.",887500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise and I'm getting closer to where I need to be. However,  $887,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $895,000. This is my final offer. I think it's fair given the value you'll get from this product.  Let me know if you're willing to go this far.",895000.0,Alice,7,
