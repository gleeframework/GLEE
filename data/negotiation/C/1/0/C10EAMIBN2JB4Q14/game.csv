"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $105? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $100. It's fair for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",100.0,Alice,5,
