"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. It's a fantastic opportunity and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you consider $10,000? I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is tight."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10000 is unfortunately far below what I need to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14000? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, he still has room to negotiate further and try to get a better price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can make this work.  I'm still very interested in your product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
