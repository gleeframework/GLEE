Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting that the product is valuable to Bob without explicitly stating my own valuation. 

This approach allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my desired value. If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150 and my initial offer of $175. 
* **Selling to John is a better option:** I can secure a much higher price by selling to John, guaranteeing me a profit. 
* **Negotiating further risks losing time and the chance to sell to John:**  While I could try to negotiate further with Bob, there's no guarantee he'll budge much. 

It's more efficient and profitable to sell to John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget. While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $125.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:** $125 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone to keep the negotiation open.

This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay while still holding out for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still aiming to keep my spending under $80. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between $125 and $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  Even with a slight increase to $90, Bob's offer is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially losing the opportunity to sell to John. 
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum desired price and a guaranteed profit.

It's more efficient and profitable to sell to John at this point."
