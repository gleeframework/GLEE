"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $18,000? ",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. It seems like we both see the value in this product. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? That's a fair compromise.",15000.0,Alice,5,
