"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've highlighted, $500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm interested in this product, but given my budget, I'd be willing to offer $350000. This is a serious offer, and I'm eager to see if we can find common ground.",350000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $425000 is closer to my target, but I'm still a bit stretched. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'd like to offer $380000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to secure the product within my budget.",380000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $400000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'd need to see the price drop to $390000 to make it work for me. This would be a great compromise, allowing us both to reach an agreement.",390000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. I understand that reaching a price that suits both parties is crucial.
