"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1500000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1750000 as a compromise. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1375000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
