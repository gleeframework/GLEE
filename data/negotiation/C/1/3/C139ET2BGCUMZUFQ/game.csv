"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a good balance between the value the product brings and the price I'm willing to pay.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however,  $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I can't go lower than $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits this product offers you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
