"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product to you, which holds immense value to both parties. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, we believe it's worth $950,000. We hope this proposal aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the market value of similar products."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I would like to propose an adjusted price of $850,000 for the product. This reflects a compromise between our original offers, while still allowing us to achieve a reasonable profit margin. I hope this revised proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $950,000 to $850,000, which is a significant decrease. Accepting her offer would allow me to acquire the product for a price I'm comfortable with, saving $150,000 compared to buying from John. While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject my counteroffer, leading to a stalemate or forcing me to buy from John at a higher price."
