"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I could consider a price of $1,100,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. That said, I need to see a more significant price reduction to make this work. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a middle ground. Let's try $950,000. This reflects a considerable discount on my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  To bridge the gap, I can go up to $750,000. Let me know if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but to be honest, we're still quite far apart. I have other interested parties, and to be fair to them, my absolute lowest price for this product is $900,000.  This is a final offer, take it or leave it.",900000.0,Alice,7,
