"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $800,000?  This would still be a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,3,
