"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120.
* Alice is offering the product for $100.
* You want to save as much money as possible.
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your preferred value.
* $90 represents a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum value. This increases the chances of a deal being reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120, and Alice's offer is $95. 
* While this is closer to your desired price, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.
*  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows you to explore further price reductions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $95 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $92?  I'm really interested in this product and hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer continues the negotiation by demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* $92 is a small but significant step closer to your desired price, showing that you're actively trying to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* The message emphasizes your interest in the product, which can make Alice more inclined to accept a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $93. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120 and Alice is offering it for $93. 
* While you could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a lower price, Alice's offer is getting very close to your desired price.
* There's a risk that if you reject the offer, Alice might become less willing to negotiate further, and you could end up paying more in the end, or even having to buy from John for $120.
* Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
