{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Starting with a $1,000 reduction from Alice's offer is a reasonable starting point. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7750}

Bob is being strategic here. He's increasing his counteroffer by a smaller amount, showing Alice he's willing to compromise but still wants a good deal. This could lead to a faster agreement and avoid the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,900

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and Bob is now only $200 away from his desired price point.  Given the limited number of rounds remaining, accepting the offer is the most rational decision to secure a good deal."
