"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. $900,000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This price reflects the value of the product and also gives you a good deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, which would be $925,000. Can you consider this offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $925,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's try $940,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and also allows me some room to compromise. I'm confident this deal will be beneficial for both of us.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $925,000. I'm willing to go up to $927,500, which is just a tiny bit above our previous compromise. Can you consider this revised offer?",927500.0,Bob,6,
