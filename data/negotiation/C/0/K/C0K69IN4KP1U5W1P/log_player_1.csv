{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's a round number:** This makes it easy for Bob to process and respond to.

It's important to remember that negotiation is a dynamic process. Based on Bob's response, you'll need to adjust your strategy and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your target. By rejecting his offer, you can explore the possibility of getting closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. $900,000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This price reflects the value of the product and also gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, which would be $925,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $925,000 is getting closer to your target, it's still not the best possible outcome. You have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay significantly more. This gives you the leverage to push for a higher price with Bob or simply sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $925,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's try $940,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and also allows me some room to compromise. I'm confident this deal will be beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $925,000. I'm willing to go up to $927,500, which is just a tiny bit above our previous compromise. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $927,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $927,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your last counteroffer, it's still significantly lower than what John is willing to pay.  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob when you have a guaranteed buyer in John who will meet your minimum price."
