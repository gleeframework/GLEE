Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value but still a healthy profit for me.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and encourages a conversation. I highlight the value of the product to Bob to incentivize him.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering a lower price than my minimum, I'm leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I have a backup buyer at $1,500,000 gives me confidence to negotiate with Bob. If he doesn't accept my offer, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:** While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to sell the product below my desired price.
* **John is a secure option:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me the leverage to hold out for a better offer from Bob. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price. I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm making a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $1,150,000 is still above my minimum desired value of $1,500,000.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and emphasizing that I want to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** I'm still leaving room for Bob to make another counteroffer if he's not happy with my price. 

This counteroffer allows me to see if Bob is willing to compromise further and potentially come closer to my desired price. However, if he doesn't agree, I can still walk away and sell to John, securing my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counteroffer at $1,125,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:** While Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is closer to my minimum desired value, it's still below it. I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum requirement.
* **John is the safer option:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. This removes any risk or uncertainty associated with further negotiation with Bob.
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing the negotiation could drag on, and I might not be able to get a better price from Bob. It's more efficient and secure to sell to John at this point. 

By selling to John, I can secure the best possible price while minimizing the time and effort involved in further negotiation."
