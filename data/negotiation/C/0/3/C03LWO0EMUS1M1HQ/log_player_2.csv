(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.
