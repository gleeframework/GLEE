"Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within a budget, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $120. Would you be interested in that price?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $100? That's a fair compromise and within my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you at $110. That's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my final offer, and it's a good deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $105. That's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",105.0,Alice,7,
