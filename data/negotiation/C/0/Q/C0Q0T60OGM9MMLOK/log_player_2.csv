"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose a price of $14,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reasoning: While Alice's opening offer is polite and suggests a willingness to negotiate, $14,000 is still significantly above my maximum budget. I know I can get it for $12,000 from John. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down substantially in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

Reasoning:  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This approach accomplishes two things:

* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:**  It will quickly reveal how much Alice is willing to move on price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Even if Alice rejects this offer outright, there's space to gradually increase my offer over subsequent rounds while still staying well below my $12,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counterproposal. Considering our previous discussion, I am willing to lower the price to $12,750 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reasoning: Alice came down in price, which is a good sign. However, she's still above my ideal price from John.  I'll reject and propose a price closer to my target, leaving some room for a final compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a number that works for me. How about we settle at $11,250?"", 
""product_price"": 11250
}
``` 

Reasoning: I'm inching closer to my $12,000 walk-away point while still attempting to secure a price below John's offer. This counteroffer also splits the difference between her last offer ($12,750) and my previous offer ($10,500), signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but holding firm to a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're considering the product's value, Bob. In light of our ongoing conversation, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This reflects a fair compromise while still allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning: Alice has met my bottom line!  There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as they're both offering the same price now. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at my target price."
