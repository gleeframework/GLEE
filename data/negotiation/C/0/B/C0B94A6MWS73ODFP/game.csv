"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm open to negotiation. I'm offering it to you for $200.  What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is my top price. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $80 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? That's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $140 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my absolute limit.  If you're not interested in that, I'll have to move on to another seller.",100.0,Bob,4,
