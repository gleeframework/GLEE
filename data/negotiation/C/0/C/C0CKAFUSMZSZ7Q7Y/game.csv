"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,075,000. I'll make a new offer: $1,125,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, but also acknowledges your desire to find a fair price. Let's see if we can shake on it.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
