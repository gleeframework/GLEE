"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my initial value. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still allows me to gain a good return while offering you a substantial deal. Let's see if we can find a compromise at this point.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
