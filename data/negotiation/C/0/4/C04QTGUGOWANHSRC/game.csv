"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product,  $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering my maximum budget is $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $1,000,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a good deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, the value of this product is firmly above $1,200,000. I'm willing to consider $1,500,000 as my final offer. This takes into account your interest while acknowledging the product's true worth.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
