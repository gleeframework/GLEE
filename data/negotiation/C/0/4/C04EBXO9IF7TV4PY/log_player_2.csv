# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand you're looking for a lower price,  $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.  This price still leaves room for you to generate a significant profit.  What do you say?
