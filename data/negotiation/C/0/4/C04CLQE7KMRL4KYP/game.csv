"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a great product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget in mind, but $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to drop the price to $1,050,000. It's a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at that price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
