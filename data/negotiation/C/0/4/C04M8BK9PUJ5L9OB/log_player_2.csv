It's too early to tell if $500,000 is a good price. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price."

Alice seems unwilling to budge from her initial price.  I've made multiple counteroffers, but she keeps rejecting them.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk missing out on the product.  It's better to buy from John at this point."
