Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my own costs. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is as low as I can go, but I'm still making a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,300,000. She's signaled this is her lowest offer. You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, saving you $100,000. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice if you have a guaranteed better deal elsewhere."
