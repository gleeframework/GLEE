"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal! What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to pay $95."
