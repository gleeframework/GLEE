Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than $1,200,000.
* **It's not unreasonable:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so this gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  You're stating your price directly.

By offering a price above your minimum, you leave room for negotiation while still setting a high bar. This will likely encourage Bob to counter-offer, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I am willing to pay $1150000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above the minimum you are willing to accept, it is significantly lower than the initial offer you made.  You are looking to maximize your profit and selling to John would guarantee you your minimum price. However, you've already invested time in negotiating with Bob, and it's possible you can get him to move closer to your desired price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter-offer and attempt to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate while still being firm about your value.  
* **Value proposition:** You reiterate the product's value to Bob to remind him of the potential benefits of accepting your offer.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a friendly tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating.

By adjusting your price and highlighting the product's value, you aim to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I believe $1200000 would be a fair price. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly your minimum acceptable price. You have two choices:

* **Accept:** This guarantees you your minimum profit and finalizes the deal. 
* **Reject and Counter-Offer:** This risks a stalemate or a further reduction in price. It's possible Bob might refuse to go higher, leaving you with only the option to sell to John, which would result in the same profit.

Since Bob has already met your minimum requirement, accepting his offer is the most sensible choice. You avoid further negotiation and secure your desired profit."
