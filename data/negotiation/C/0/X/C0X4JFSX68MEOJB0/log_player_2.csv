"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still a significant amount. Since you have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a good value for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I want to pay. I'm willing to go up slightly, but I'm not ready to accept $1,300,000 yet. I have more rounds to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm happy to split the difference and offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
