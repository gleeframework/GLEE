"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest and understand your budget, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a significant discount for you, and it allows me to still receive a fair price.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
