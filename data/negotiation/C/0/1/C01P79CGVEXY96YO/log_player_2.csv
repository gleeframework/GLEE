"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is within his budget, it's not the best deal. He's willing to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly establish a lower price point. 
* **Realistic Offer:** $7,500 is still a reasonable price for Bob, considering his maximum budget and Alice's perceived value of $8,000.
* **Clear Communication:** Bob explains his reasoning and shows willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $8,500 is closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He knows he can buy the product from John for $8,000, so he has a clear benchmark for what he's willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,200.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Bob is moving closer to Alice's price but still maintaining a margin for negotiation. 
* **Strong Justification:**  He emphasizes fairness and the value of the product, trying to appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Open to Compromise:**  By suggesting they find ""common ground,"" Bob implies he's open to a small adjustment if necessary."
