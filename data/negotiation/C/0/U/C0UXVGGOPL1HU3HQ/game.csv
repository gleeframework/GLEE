"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $95 for your product.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $105 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $100 for your product, which matches the price offered by another seller, John.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $100 is a good starting point, but I still need to make a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  I think that's a fair compromise.",102.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. I am willing to pay $101 for your product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.",101.0,Bob,6,
