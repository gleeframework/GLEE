``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell quickly, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $105 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $100 is a good starting point, but I still need to make a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 102.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. I am willing to pay $101 for your product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $101
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original goal of $115, it's getting late in the negotiation and I'm concerned about running out of time.  $101 is better than my minimum of $120 and it's a good price considering the back-and-forth.  I'm going to go for it!"
