"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to provide room for negotiation and gauge her flexibility.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation.
* **Clear Target:** By offering $1,100,000, I'm aiming for a price close to Alice's perceived value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I think this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, the current price is still significantly higher than my target.
* **Negotiation Room:**  There are several rounds left, giving us space to find a price point closer to both of our valuations. 
* **Alternative:** The option to buy from John provides a safety net if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground.  To be frank, $1,300,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we try $1,175,000? I'm keen to make this work."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm showing willingness to move closer to Alice's price, but in smaller increments to signal I'm seeking a more significant discount. 
* **Transparency:** By being upfront about my budget constraints (without revealing my absolute limit), I'm aiming to encourage Alice to be more flexible.
* **Continued Interest:**  Reiterating my interest in the product emphasizes that I'm serious about finding a mutually acceptable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,175,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,250,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** At $1,250,000, the price is below my maximum budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's offer.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Alice has indicated this is her lowest price, suggesting further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Accepting now secures the product and avoids potential complications or delays."
