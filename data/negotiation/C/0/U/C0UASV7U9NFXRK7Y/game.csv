"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I think this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground.  To be frank, $1,300,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we try $1,175,000? I'm keen to make this work.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,175,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,250,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
