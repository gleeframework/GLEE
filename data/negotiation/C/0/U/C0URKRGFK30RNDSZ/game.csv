"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this to be a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is beyond my current budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it, given its potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects the immense value this product brings.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm offering the product for $975,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise from my initial asking price.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $975,000 is still a bit outside my budget. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to offer $925,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I'm hopeful it's a price that works for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
