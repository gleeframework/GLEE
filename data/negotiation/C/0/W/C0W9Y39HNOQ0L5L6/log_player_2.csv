"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  It's better to reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately outside of my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This reflects the true value I see in the product for my business. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, the product's value to me is significantly higher than that. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the product's true potential while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm not comfortable with that price.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still limited to $800,000.  I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your position.  To be frank, that price point doesn't work for me unless there's something else we can add to the deal that brings value to both of us.  Perhaps there's a service or partnership opportunity we could explore in conjunction with the product? I'm open to getting creative if it means finding a win-win. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer hasn't changed and she's now suggesting additional services or partnerships. This complicates the deal and makes it more difficult to negotiate a price I'm comfortable with.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to budge on her price.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John, as I'm guaranteed to get it for my target price."
