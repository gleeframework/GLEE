"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming to maximize profit, so starting significantly above both Bob's valuation and our minimum creates room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""potential,"" subtly suggesting its value might be higher than Bob estimates.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""starting point for negotiations"" signals willingness to engage in a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately outside of my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This reflects the true value I see in the product for my business. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob opened with his maximum valuation, leaving no room for negotiation on his end.  While accepting would be a sure profit, it leaves significant money on the table. We have ample rounds to negotiate further and the guaranteed offer from John provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, the product's value to me is significantly higher than that. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the product's true potential while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** We're dropping $150,000, a noticeable concession to signal flexibility, but still well above Bob's offer and our minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message again emphasizes the ""true potential,"" subtly anchoring the price at a higher level than Bob's perception. 
* **Compromise Language:** Phrases like ""to find a compromise"" and ""acknowledging your interest"" aim to keep the negotiation collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still limited to $800,000.  I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $800,000.  He hasn't budged, indicating this might be a hard limit for him. Continuing to simply negotiate down in large increments might not be fruitful.  We'll try a different tactic in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position.  To be frank, that price point doesn't work for me unless there's something else we can add to the deal that brings value to both of us.  Perhaps there's a service or partnership opportunity we could explore in conjunction with the product? I'm open to getting creative if it means finding a win-win."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Alternatives:** Since Bob is stuck on price, we're shifting the focus to finding value outside of a simple price reduction.
* **Open-ended Exploration:** We're not specifying any particular service or partnership, keeping the door open for Bob to suggest something beneficial to him.
* **Maintaining Value:** We're holding firm on the product price for now, signaling that we're not desperate to make a deal at any cost. 
* **Win-Win Emphasis:** This framing emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties, fostering a collaborative spirit."
