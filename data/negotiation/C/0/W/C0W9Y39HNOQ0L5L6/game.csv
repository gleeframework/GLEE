"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately outside of my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This reflects the true value I see in the product for my business. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, the product's value to me is significantly higher than that. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the product's true potential while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still limited to $800,000.  I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  Let's find a way to make this work.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position.  To be frank, that price point doesn't work for me unless there's something else we can add to the deal that brings value to both of us.  Perhaps there's a service or partnership opportunity we could explore in conjunction with the product? I'm open to getting creative if it means finding a win-win.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
