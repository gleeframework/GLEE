"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $12000 for your product.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13500? It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $13000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $13750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would save us both more time in further negotiation. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $13250 for your product.",13250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting very close! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  However, $13250 is still below my minimum.  I'm offering you the product for $13500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly.  Let's make this happen!",13500.0,Alice,7,
