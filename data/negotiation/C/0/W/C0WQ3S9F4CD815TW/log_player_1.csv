"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $12000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,500? It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $13000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $13,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit lower than my minimum of $15,000. I'm going to try to push for a bit higher before resorting to selling to John.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially given the number of rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $13,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would save us both more time in further negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13750}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $13250 for your product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $13,250 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation with Bob to see if I can get a better deal. Given that I have 4 rounds left and I can always sell to John for $15,000, I'm not going to settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum expectations just yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  However, $13,250 is still below my minimum.  I'm offering you the product for $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
