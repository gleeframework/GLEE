Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $14,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I want a high price, starting at $15,000 might scare Bob off.  $14,000 leaves room for him to counter-offer if he wants, while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate, so I can aim high with Bob."
