"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I think  $1,150,000 represents a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Even though Alice's offer is slightly better than what John is offering, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Bob can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
