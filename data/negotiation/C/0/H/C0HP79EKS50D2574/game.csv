"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still a good value for you.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's a significant discount for you and a good value for me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for this.  It's still a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and it gives you a great value for the product.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,150,000 is still a little more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering your asking price. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
