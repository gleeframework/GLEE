"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your honesty about the price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $850,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
