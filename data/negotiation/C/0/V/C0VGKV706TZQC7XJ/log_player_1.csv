"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I know Bob values the product at $8,000, so this price is still a good deal for him.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm also prepared to counter-offer if he rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is still too low for me, even though it's closer to my minimum value.  I'm confident that I can get a better price with further negotiation.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to be flexible, but also that I'm not willing to give away the product for too low a price. I believe this offer is fair and could potentially lead to a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his last one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that price, as I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I'm still optimistic that we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $10,200. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still above Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping that this shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to go too far below my target price. I'm hoping that this offer is attractive enough to lead to a successful negotiation in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are halfway through the negotiation and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware that John is a guaranteed sale for $12,000.  I'm going to sell the product to John to ensure I get my desired value and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
