"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** By offering $15,000, I can see if Bob is truly interested in the product and has a high perceived value. This will help me decide my strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still above $10,000. I'm not in a rush and believe I can potentially get a better price.
* **Negotiation is key:**  Rejecting allows me to continue the negotiation and see if Bob is willing to increase his offer further.
* **Testing Bob's limits:** This rejection will let Bob know that I am serious about getting a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm decreasing my price from $15,000 to $13,500, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** This offer keeps me above my minimum selling price, which is $10,000.
* **Compromise:**  $13,500 represents a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm flexible while trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on a deal:** Bob's offer is now only $500 less than my previous counteroffer, indicating we're getting close to an agreement.
* **Time is a factor:** We're already in Round 4, and each round decreases my leverage. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and prevents risking a counteroffer that might be lower.
* **Reasonable price:**  $12,500 is a fair price considering my minimum acceptable value is $10,000."
