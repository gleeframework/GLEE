"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $12000? I believe that would be a fair compromise for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still committed to staying within my budget. Could we possibly meet at $12500? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while also acknowledging the value of the product.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised by offering $13500 and then $13000 isn't an option for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $14000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",14000.0,Alice,5,
