,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Can we try $9,750? It's the best I can do.",9750.0,Bob,4,
