Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is simply too high.  Given my budget and the product's true market value, I'm willing to pay $600,000. Let's work together to reach a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle - how about $900,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm confident that $700,000 is a fair price, considering the value I'm placing on this product. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $800,000 within the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer means a $100,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's more profitable to take the sure thing with John at this point."
