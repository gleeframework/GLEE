"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but not too high to scare Bob off immediately.  I'll see if Bob is willing to negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $150.  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $140. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still leaves some room for profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is close to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'm hoping to get a bit closer to $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $125. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I'm still above my minimum. I believe this price is fair and might be attractive to Bob, especially since we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum. At this point, I'm getting worried that I might not get a better deal from Bob.  I've already made substantial concessions, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a very low price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120."
