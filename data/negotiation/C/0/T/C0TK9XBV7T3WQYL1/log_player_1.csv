We're still significantly above John's offer, and there's room to negotiate with Bob.  It's too early to settle for John's price."

While we could try to push for a bit more, Bob is clearly moving towards our price and we're far exceeding John's offer. Accepting now secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer later."
