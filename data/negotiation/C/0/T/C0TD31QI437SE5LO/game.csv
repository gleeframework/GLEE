"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit as well.  What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  That way, we both get a fair deal, and I can avoid going with John.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
