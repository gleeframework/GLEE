"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000, which would be $1275000. I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
