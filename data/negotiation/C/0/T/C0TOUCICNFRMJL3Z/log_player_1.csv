{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for a profit, not just recouping your minimum.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring a profitable deal for you.
* **It sets a clear starting point:** This establishes a base for further discussion. 

By starting with this offer, you leave open the possibility of reaching a higher price while still protecting your minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While you could accept it and secure a sale, it would result in a much lower profit than you could potentially achieve.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better outcome:**  You know the product is worth more to Bob, so there's still room for negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps you in control of the negotiation and allows you to push for a higher price. 
* **Risk assessment:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $1,200,000, it's a lower profit than what you could potentially get from Bob.

**Next steps:**  You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your initial offer or somewhere between his offer and your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:** It's a midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates you're open to negotiation while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Appeal to reason:**  You justify the price by referencing the value of the product.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still setting a firm price that allows you to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000, which would be $1275000. I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still lower than your initial goal, it's a significant improvement over his previous offer and is very close to your minimum acceptable price.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable deal:** Accepting this offer secures a profit of $75,000, which is a decent outcome considering Bob's initial stance.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but it also carries the risk of Bob walking away or you needing to sell to John for a lower amount. 
* **Time and effort:** Continuing the negotiation would take more time and effort, potentially delaying the sale and the opportunity to reinvest the funds.

**Conclusion:**

In this situation, accepting Bob's offer represents a balanced decision that balances profit with the potential risks and time investment of further negotiation."
