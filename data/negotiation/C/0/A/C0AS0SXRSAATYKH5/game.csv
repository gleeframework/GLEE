"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,100,000 is my absolute bottom line. This still allows you a significant profit margin. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
