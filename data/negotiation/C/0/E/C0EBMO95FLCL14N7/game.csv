"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1000000. I would like to propose an alternative price of $950000 to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $975000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still seeking to keep the cost below $975000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $960000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",960000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to keep the cost as low as possible, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I can sell the product to you for $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I value your product, but I'm still working within a specific budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $970000. I hope this offers a reasonable compromise that allows us to move forward.",970000.0,Bob,6,
