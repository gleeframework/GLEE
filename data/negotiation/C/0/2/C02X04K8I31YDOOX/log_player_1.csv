"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you! I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:** This price leaves room for Bob to negotiate without me feeling pressured to drop too low immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work out a better price. How about $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target price:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my target of $100.
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue this negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **Potential loss:**  While selling to John for $80 is guaranteed, it's less than my target price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is the lowest I can go.  It's still a great deal for you, considering how much it's worth to you.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, reinforcing the deal's attractiveness.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept, creating a potential pressure point."
