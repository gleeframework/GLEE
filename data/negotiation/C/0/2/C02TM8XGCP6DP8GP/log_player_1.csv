Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know this product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm open to negotiation. Let's find a price that works for us both."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
