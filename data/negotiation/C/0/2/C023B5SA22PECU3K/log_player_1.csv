Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a better price. How about $700,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $700,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $700,000 is simply too low.  I understand you want a good deal, but this product is worth significantly more to you. How about we split the difference and agree on $850,000?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think $850,000 is still quite high. Considering the value it holds for me, how about we settle for $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is the same as what John is offering.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale and wasting more time negotiating with Bob."
