Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think it's a great deal and would be very useful for you."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  While the product is worth $100 to Bob, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Offering it at $125 gives Bob a potential discount while still netting you a $25 profit, which is better than selling to John at your minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a good profit. If he rejects or negotiates, you have the option to adjust slightly downward or stand firm knowing John will buy it at your minimum."
