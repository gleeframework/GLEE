"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. While the true value of this product is significantly higher, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects the potential benefit it would bring you. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000 for the product. This price allows for a substantial gain for you while remaining fair to me. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
