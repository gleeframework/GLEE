"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better price through counteroffers. There are still 9 rounds to negotiate, giving you room to potentially lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your budget, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose we finalize the transaction at $925,000. Please let me know if this meets your requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a lower price with more rounds. It's important to remember that Alice values the product at $1,200,000, so there is a significant difference in our valuations. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $925,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $910,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your willingness to compromise. I understand your position and would like to make a final offer. I am proposing to sell the product to you for $915,000. I hope this price aligns better with your budget and allows us to conclude this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $915,000 is now within my budget. While I'd prefer to pay less, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. With only 5 rounds remaining, I'm comfortable accepting this offer as it's a significant saving compared to buying from John. It's a good compromise and allows me to secure the product without exceeding my budget."
