"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice is offering it for $90, which is a good deal, but you can get it for $100 from John if you reject her offer. Since you are trying to save as much money as possible, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $100."
