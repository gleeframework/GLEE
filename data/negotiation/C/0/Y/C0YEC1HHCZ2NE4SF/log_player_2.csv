# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what Bob can get the product for elsewhere.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
