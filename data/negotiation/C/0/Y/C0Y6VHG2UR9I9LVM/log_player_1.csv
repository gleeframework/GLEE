{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm offering a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, making it attractive for him. However, I'm still earning a substantial profit and am confident I can reach a final price closer to $1,500,000 if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, even though it's still a profit for me. I'm not ready to settle for $1,200,000 just yet. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since the product is worth so much to him. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $1,300,000 is a good compromise, considering I was thinking more in the range of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my desired range.  I'm not sure I can push for much more, and accepting this offer guarantees me a good profit.  It's time to close the deal."
