"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is far above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still significantly below what I'd consider. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  I truly believe this is a fair price, given the value I place on the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise considering our individual valuations.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
