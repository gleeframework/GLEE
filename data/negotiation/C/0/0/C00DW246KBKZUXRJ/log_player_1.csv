Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is far above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still significantly below what I'd consider. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  I truly believe this is a fair price, given the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is holding firm at his maximum price. It's time to start moving closer to our guaranteed sale price with John, but we'll continue negotiating for now to see if we can get a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise considering our individual valuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now moved $200,000 above his initial offer. While we could try to push for a bit more, accepting $1,400,000 is a strong deal. It's $100,000 less than John's offer, but it avoids the risk of Bob walking away and potentially getting stuck with no sale."
