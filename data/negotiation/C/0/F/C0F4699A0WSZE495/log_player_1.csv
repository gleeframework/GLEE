"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for such a low price.  It's better to reject and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,100,000 is far too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,400,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's much closer to what I need to sell.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $1,250,000. Would that price be workable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 I need to receive.  I'm not willing to accept anything less than that.  However, with 6 rounds left, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,250,000 is still significantly below my minimum. To keep things moving, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're ready to make a decision."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,300,000? That feels like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum, but it's getting very close.  We've been negotiating for a while, and I want to close the deal.  Also, with only 4 rounds left, it's risky to keep rejecting offers. If I keep pushing, I might not get a better offer and could end up selling to John for $1,500,000, which is less than what I'm currently offered."
