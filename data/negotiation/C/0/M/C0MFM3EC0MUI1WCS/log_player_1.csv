Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it.
* **Alternative Option:**  Hinting at selling ""publicly"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice is secure knowing John will purchase it for her minimum acceptable price."
