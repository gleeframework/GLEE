"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and uses positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I create space for Bob to counteroffer and ultimately reach a price that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go higher than $12,500.  That's my absolute top limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired threshold of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a middle ground. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John immediately would guarantee $15,000, but it's too early to give up on Bob.  I want to explore if I can get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise, lowering the price to $13,500 which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm flexible and willing to meet him halfway.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** I'm emphasizing the importance of finding a mutually acceptable solution, indicating I'm open to continuing negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $13,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We are already in round 4, and each round brings me closer to selling to John for $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that I'll run out of time. Accepting his offer secures a decent price, even though it's not ideal."
