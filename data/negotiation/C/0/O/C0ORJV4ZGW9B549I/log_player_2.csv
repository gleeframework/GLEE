"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique and valuable product to you. Given its worth to us, we are offering it to you at an exclusive price of $12,000. This represents a significant saving compared to our standard pricing, while still allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin. We believe this is a win-win opportunity for both parties. Should you be interested, please let us know promptly so we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can purchase the product from John for a price that fits within his budget."
