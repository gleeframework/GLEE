"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential and worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, your starting price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to reach a mutually beneficial deal. This offer reflects the product's potential and allows for a reasonable return on your investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still finding it difficult to meet at that price point. Would you consider $750,000?  I believe this would be a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $850,000? This ensures you're getting a great deal on a valuable asset.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  I could potentially stretch to $800,000, but that's really the limit of what I'm comfortable with.",800000.0,Bob,6,
