,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $14000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work this out!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $15500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $15500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15750? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",15750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $15750 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $15500, but I think we can do better than that. How about $15250? I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",15250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $15500. This is a fair price for the product, considering its value.  If you are truly interested in making this deal work, I'm willing to meet you at this price.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",15500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $15000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",15000.0,Bob,8,
