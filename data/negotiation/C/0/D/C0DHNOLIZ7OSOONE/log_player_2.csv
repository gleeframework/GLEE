{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's within your budget, it's still a significant amount of money.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating.  There's also the possibility of getting a significantly better price from Alice, or by buying from John."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth.

This offer demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring the product, and I believe it's a solid foundation for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 880000}

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still $20,000 more than your last offer.  You are getting closer to a deal, but it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a price even lower. You also still have the option of buying from John, which gives you a safety net in case the negotiation falls apart."

Round 6
