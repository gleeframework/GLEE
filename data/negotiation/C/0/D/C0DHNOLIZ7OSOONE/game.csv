"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $880,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and reflects a fair value for both of us. This offer demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring the product, and I believe it's a solid foundation for a mutually beneficial agreement.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This reflects my bottom line while still providing you with a great deal on a valuable asset.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $890,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while still leaving room for you to profit.  Let's close this deal.",890000.0,Bob,6,
