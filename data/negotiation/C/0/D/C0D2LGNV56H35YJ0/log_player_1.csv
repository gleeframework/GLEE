{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $14,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for negotiation. It also shows I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $12,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $13,000,  which still reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
