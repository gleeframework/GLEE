"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $14000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12000 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $13000,  which still reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is a better price than John's $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away and forcing him to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially prudent option at this point."
