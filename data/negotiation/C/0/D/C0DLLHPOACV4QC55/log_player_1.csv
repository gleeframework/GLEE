This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price.  It leaves room for negotiation while still being a profitable sale for me."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a budget of $10,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my needs? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls short of my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
