,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I'm confident you'll find this price still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'd love to close this deal, $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $10,200.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
