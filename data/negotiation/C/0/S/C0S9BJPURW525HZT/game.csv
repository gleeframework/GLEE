"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise between our initial offers.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $775,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
