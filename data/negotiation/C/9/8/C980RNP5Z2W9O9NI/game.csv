"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $108 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $112. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!",112.0,Alice,5,
