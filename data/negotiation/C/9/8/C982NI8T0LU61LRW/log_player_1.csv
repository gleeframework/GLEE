Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. Let me know your decision - this offer stands for a limited time."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. It's easier to come down from an initial offer.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the higher price.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a time limit can prompt Bob to make a quicker decision."
