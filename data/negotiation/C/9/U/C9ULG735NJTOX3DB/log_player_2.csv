"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my ideal price point, but it's a good starting point.  I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price. There are 9 rounds left, so there's time to work with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I think we can do better than $850,000. I'm willing to lower my price to $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my ideal price, but I see that she's willing to negotiate.  I believe I can push for a lower price, and I have several rounds remaining to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows us both to walk away with a reasonable deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment to the price. However, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I think we're getting close to a fair price. I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also acknowledges your willingness to meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's the same as her initial offer from round 1. Since she is not budging further, it's likely that this is her final offer.  It's better to accept and save some money rather than risk her rejecting my next counteroffer and potentially forcing me to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
