Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $11,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but it's still a ""deal"" compared to your backup offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but wants a slightly lower price."
