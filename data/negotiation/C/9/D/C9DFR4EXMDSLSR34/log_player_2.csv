You can do better than $135.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

I'm offering $125. This is a fair price, as it's still above your value for the product ($120) but gives Alice a decent profit."

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but you can still try to negotiate further. Rejecting allows for one more counteroffer."

I'm offering $128. This is a slight increase from my previous offer but still a good deal for Alice, as it's above her minimum acceptable price."

Alice is not budging on her price, and it's unlikely she'll accept a lower offer.  It's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John."
