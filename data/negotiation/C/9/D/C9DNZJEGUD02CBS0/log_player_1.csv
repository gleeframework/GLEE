Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth significantly more than that to me. I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value ($15,000) but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to me, hoping to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not going all-in on the first offer, as that could leave me with no room to adjust if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** If Bob rejects my offer, I have the option to go to John for a guaranteed $15,000. This gives me a fallback position and helps me make more informed decisions during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8,500 right now.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $8,500 is far below my minimum value of $15,000 and significantly lower than my initial offer. Accepting this would be a substantial loss.
* **Room for negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. 
* **John as a backup:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me leverage and allows me to be more aggressive in my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is unfortunately not feasible for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my minimum:** I'm moving closer to my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to make my price seem reasonable. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiations.
* **John as a safety net:** I'm still aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, which gives me confidence to push for a better price with Bob."
