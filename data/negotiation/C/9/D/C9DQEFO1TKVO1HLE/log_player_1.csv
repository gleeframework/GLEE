Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still aiming for a bit closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This would still leave a good margin for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
