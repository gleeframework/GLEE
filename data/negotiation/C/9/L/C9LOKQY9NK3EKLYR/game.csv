"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit outside of what I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can do better than $85, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me. While I'm happy to see you're coming down in price, $100 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. Would you consider $90? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $95, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a one-time offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",95.0,Alice,5,
