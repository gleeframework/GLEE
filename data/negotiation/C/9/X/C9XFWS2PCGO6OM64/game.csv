"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $10000 is significantly less than the product's true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12500?  This reflects the value I've placed on the product and gives you a fair price. Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
