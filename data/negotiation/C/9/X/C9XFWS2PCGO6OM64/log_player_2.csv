"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a unique opportunity and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice first to see if she's willing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $10000 is significantly less than the product's true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12500?  This reflects the value I've placed on the product and gives you a fair price. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her original offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He can still get the same product from John for $10,000, making it more advantageous to continue negotiating with Alice or go with John."
