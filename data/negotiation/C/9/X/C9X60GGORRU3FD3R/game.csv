"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the opportunity cost of pursuing this deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original offer. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is my maximum.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the opportunity cost of going with another seller.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and the original offer I made. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
