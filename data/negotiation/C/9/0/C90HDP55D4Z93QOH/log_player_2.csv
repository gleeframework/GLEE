{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a better price.  Even though $1,150,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for improvement. We can try to get closer to Alice's desired price of $1,000,000 in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still provides a reasonable profit margin for Alice. It's likely she will accept this offer, but if not, we can continue to negotiate in the following rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to save money. This offer splits the difference between my last offer and Alice's latest offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  If Alice accepts, I've secured a good deal. If she rejects, we can continue to negotiate in the next rounds."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in her price. At $1,090,000, the product is now within my budget and a good deal for me. While I could try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or stall the negotiations.  Accepting this offer secures the purchase and saves me $10,000 compared to buying from John."
