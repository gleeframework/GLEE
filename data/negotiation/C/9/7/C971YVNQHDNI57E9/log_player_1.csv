"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get as much as possible. This leaves room for negotiation, and if Bob rejects, I can always come down a bit.  However, I'm also aware that John is a safe bet for $1,200,000, so I'm not going to be afraid to walk away if Bob isn't reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than what I'd get from John, I'm still not satisfied. There's a lot of room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to see if I can get Bob to budge closer to $1,200,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming high.  $1,300,000 is a good compromise, and it demonstrates to Bob that I'm serious about a deal, but I also value the product.  It's a good starting point for round 3."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can squeeze out a little bit more before taking John's offer. I'm going to counter with a price that's just a little bit lower than my ideal but still higher than what Bob is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob $1,250,000. This is a compromise that's closer to what Bob wants but still leaves me a bit of profit. I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,200,000 yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Finally, Bob is offering my minimum price! It's time to close the deal.  While I could technically keep negotiating, it's not worth the risk of losing Bob altogether and having to settle for John's offer.  This is a good outcome."
