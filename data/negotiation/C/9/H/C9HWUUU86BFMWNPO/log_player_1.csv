{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be a great fit for it.  My asking price is $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly opening message encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, my budget is limited and I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Would you consider adjusting your price accordingly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).**  I cannot accept it and still meet my own financial goals.
* **There's room for negotiation.** While Bob is offering my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. 
* **John is a backup.** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000 gives me leverage in these negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value this product at a higher price, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but offering a counter-proposal to show my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Middle Ground:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my flexibility and willingness to find a compromise. 
* **Re-emphasizing Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to subtly push him towards accepting a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. Considering my budget, could we possibly negotiate the price down to $10,500? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below the $12,000 minimum I need to meet.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for a higher counteroffer, potentially closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net.** I have a guaranteed $12,000 sale with John, giving me leverage to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,500, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. This would allow both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm demonstrating continued flexibility by lowering my price again, but only slightly. This shows I'm serious about selling to Bob, but not willing to go below my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing my offer as a win-win for both of us, highlighting the fact that this is a fair price for the product's value. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's final stance. If he rejects, I can choose to either accept John's offer or make one final counteroffer."
