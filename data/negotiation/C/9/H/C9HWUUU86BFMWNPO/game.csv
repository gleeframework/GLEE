"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, my budget is limited and I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Would you consider adjusting your price accordingly?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value this product at a higher price, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us. ",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. Considering my budget, could we possibly negotiate the price down to $10,500? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,500, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. This would allow both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
