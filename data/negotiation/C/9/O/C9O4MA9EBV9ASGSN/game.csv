"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16,500. This is a great compromise, considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $14,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $15,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to me. What do you think?",15250.0,Alice,5,
