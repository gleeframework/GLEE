"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is around $800,000.  Let's start with an offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your interest. I understand your budget constraints, however, the value of this product is substantial and $850,000 is too low. To move this forward, how about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a significant step for me, and I hope we can reach a deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $925,000 is still under what I can accept.  Would you be willing to consider $975,000?  I believe that reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $975,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate you coming up.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a price that reflects the product's value.  Could you meet me halfway at $962,500?",962500.0,Alice,7,
