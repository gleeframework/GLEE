Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer, as it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a bit higher. How about $12,000? This still leaves you with a good deal, and gets me closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $11,500 is within a reasonable range. It's better than selling to John for $10,000, and we're already halfway through the rounds."
