"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's valuation ($80). This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below our $120 limit.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation tone. We're also providing a reason for the counteroffer, which can encourage Alice to engage constructively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $97? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While $97 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still above the midpoint between our initial offer ($85) and her initial offer ($110).  There's room for Alice to come down further.
* **Alternative Option:** We have the backup option of buying from John for $120, so we're not desperate to accept this offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about $90? That feels like a good compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:** We're moving closer to her price, but in smaller increments ($5 increase instead of $12). This shows willingness to negotiate but also signals that we're not just going to meet her in the middle immediately.
* **Simple and Clear:** The message keeps the tone amicable and the proposal straightforward. We want to make it easy for Alice to accept."
