"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. However, $900,000 is considerably below its true worth and potential returns. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this reflects my willingness to make a deal while still ensuring a fair price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that balances your needs with my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise here.  However, I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Let's cut to the chase â€“ I can't accept anything below $1,000,000. This is my final offer. It represents a significant compromise on my part and reflects my desire to get this deal done.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to be realistic about the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. If you're not willing to budge, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
