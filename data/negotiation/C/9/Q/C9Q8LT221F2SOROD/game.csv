,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sticking with my offer of $85.  Let's make this deal happen.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment. Let's close this deal.",95.0,Alice,5,
