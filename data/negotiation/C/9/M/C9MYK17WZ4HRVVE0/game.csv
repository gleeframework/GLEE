"I understand you're interested in the product, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to consider that?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not ready to go as low as $110. I can offer it to you for $125. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you!",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $115. Can you consider that?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate that. However, $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer it to you for $122.50. Let me know if that works for you!",122.5,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but $122.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $117.50. Can you consider that?",117.5,Bob,8,
