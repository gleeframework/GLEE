"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's estimated value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation while still leaving a healthy profit margin for me.
* **Being polite:**  I'm using a friendly and respectful tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm providing a reason for the price to make it seem more justified and less arbitrary.

This strategy aims to open the negotiation in a positive way, setting a high initial price while leaving space for adjustments and potentially securing a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,700,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, this offer is too low to consider at this stage.  

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. This will allow me to counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially getting a better deal or prompting Bob to come closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that my offer is still fair, even with the reduction.
* **Seeking common ground:** I'm expressing openness to finding a middle ground, creating a more collaborative tone in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a position of strength.  The goal is to nudge Bob closer to my desired price without pushing him away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price. It also provides more leverage to potentially push Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000.  This is my absolute minimum, and it reflects the true value of the product. I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm counter-offering with a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying firm on my minimum. 
* **Highlighting minimum:**  I'm explicitly stating that $1,500,000 is my absolute minimum price, adding weight to my offer and signaling that I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing my offer as a fair price for both of us, emphasizing that it's not simply about my profit but also about finding a mutually beneficial agreement.

This strategy aims to pressure Bob to make a final decision. I'm setting a clear boundary while maintaining a collaborative tone, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept my offer and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,500,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is the maximum I can afford and still get a good deal on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my price.  

I've already reached my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  Rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially wasting more time, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I receive my desired price and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiations."
