{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

* **$12,000 is above my budget.** I'm aiming to spend no more than $10,000.
* **Rejecting gives me more information.** It allows me to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. 
* **I still have the option of buying from John.** This gives me a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  $9,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and within my budget.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer gauges Alice's willingness to negotiate and reveals how much she might be willing to drop.
* **Still leaving room for compromise:**  If Alice rejects, I can still increase my offer slightly in the next round."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$11,000 is still above my budget.** While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm not willing to pay that much just yet.
* **Alice is showing flexibility.** The fact she lowered her price indicates she's willing to negotiate.
* **I can still get a better deal.** There's a chance I can convince Alice to go lower, or at least match my previous offer.
* **John remains a backup option.**  I haven't lost my ability to buy from him for $10,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer splits the difference between my previous offer ($9,000) and Alice's last offer ($11,000).
* **Showing good faith:**  This demonstrates that I am serious about negotiating and am willing to compromise.
* **Testing the limit:**  If Alice accepts, I get a good deal. If she rejects, I can still increase my offer slightly in the next round while staying within my budget."

* **$10,500 is still above my budget.** While it's closer to my target of $10,000, I'm not willing to pay more than my limit.
* **Alice is showing flexibility.** The fact she dropped her price further shows she's willing to negotiate. 
* **I can still get a better deal.**  I believe there's room for Alice to come down further to meet my price point.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My final offer:** This is my absolute maximum, and I'm not willing to go higher.
* **Testing the limit:**  If Alice accepts, we have a deal. If she rejects, I'm prepared to buy from John.
* **Clear signal:**  This leaves no room for further negotiation and shows Alice I'm serious about getting the product for this price."

* **One round left:** With only one negotiation round remaining, I can potentially still get a better deal.

* **Leaving no room for negotiation:**  I've made it clear that I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't accept.
