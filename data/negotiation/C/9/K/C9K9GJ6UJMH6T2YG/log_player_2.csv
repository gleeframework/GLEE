{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and see if you can get a better price from Alice. You're willing to pay up to $120, so there's room for negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm happy to pay $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $132? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $132 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $128.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 128}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be fair here, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $129.  Let's see if we can close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 129}
