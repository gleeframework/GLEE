"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'll love it! I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm happy to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $132? That's a fair price for both of us.",132.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $132 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $128.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $128 is getting closer.  How about $130? I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be fair here, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $129.  Let's see if we can close this deal. ",129.0,Bob,6,
