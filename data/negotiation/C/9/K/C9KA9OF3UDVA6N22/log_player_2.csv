"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I believe it's worth a lot to the right person. I'm starting with an offer of $20000. Let me know what you think!

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's wise to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

```

**Reasoning:**

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to try and negotiate a slightly lower price.  There's still a chance to get a better deal than John's offer, especially if Alice is close to accepting Bob's desired price."
