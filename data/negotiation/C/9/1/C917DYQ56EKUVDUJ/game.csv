"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm willing to consider it.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours, and settle on $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle from my original offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come up a bit.  How does $11,750 sound?",11750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm getting close to my minimum price.",13250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already gone lower than I was comfortable with. I'm afraid I need to stand firm at my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",12000.0,Alice,9,
