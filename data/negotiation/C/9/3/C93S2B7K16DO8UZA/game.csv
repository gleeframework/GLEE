"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in this product.  However, $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which I believe reflects its fair market value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to gain a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000.  This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in this product. However, $1,250,000 remains below my acceptable threshold.  I'm willing to consider $1,350,000 as a final compromise. This price allows both of us to secure a beneficial deal. Let's reach an agreement in this round.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I'm still trying to work within my budget.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
