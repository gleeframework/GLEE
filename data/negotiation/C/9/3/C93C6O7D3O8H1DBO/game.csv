"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $11,500, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit more reasonable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Can you consider $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $9,750 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference one last time -  I'm willing to accept $10,125.  This is a good deal for both of us.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be fair, but $10,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,900, which is as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider my offer?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,900 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, we can end the negotiation.",10000.0,Alice,7,
