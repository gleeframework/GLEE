"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can still potentially save money by negotiating. He should try to get closer to his $1,000,000 target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his target price range.  He should reject the offer and try to get closer to his $1,000,000 goal. While Alice might be more hesitant to negotiate, there's still a chance she'll budge to secure the sale."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm close to your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my $1,000,000 target. Would you be willing to consider $1,025,000?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to get closer to your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1030000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll still find the product valuable at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has made it clear that she won't go any lower than $1,030,000. While Bob can still go with John's offer, it's a risk.  It's possible that John might raise his price later, or the product might be sold before Bob can secure it. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price, close to his target, and without the risk of losing out."
