Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer is significantly higher than my minimum price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price is attractive to Bob, as it's lower than the product's worth to him ($1,500,000), but still allows me to earn a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is close to my ideal price, I believe I can push for a better deal. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $1,425,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price if I continue to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $1,375,000. This is a significant reduction from my last offer, but it's still above my minimum price and a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiation with Bob has gone on for a few rounds and his offers are starting to get very close to my minimum price, but I'm not convinced I'll be able to get a better deal. To avoid risking losing the sale entirely, I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
