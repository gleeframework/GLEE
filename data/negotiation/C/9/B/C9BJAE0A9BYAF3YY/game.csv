,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $800000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to come to an agreement. Let's see if we can make this happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
