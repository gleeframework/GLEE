Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate from there.  Since I don't know his valuation, I'm starting with a relatively high offer.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to adjust based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit to show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiating.  $1,300,000 is still well above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum and still significantly more profitable than selling to John for $1,200,000. I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
