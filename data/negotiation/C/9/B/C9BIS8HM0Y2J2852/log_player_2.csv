The product is too expensive at $1,500,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before buying from John."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still within the range of my maximum budget. Hopefully, this will encourage Alice to negotiate further."

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my budget, I'm still willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a lower price."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price. Hopefully, this will lead to a final agreement."
