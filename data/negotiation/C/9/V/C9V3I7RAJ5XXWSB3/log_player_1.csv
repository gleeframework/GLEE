Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for both of us, highlighting the potential value Bob will get.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, inviting Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize Potential Earnings:**  If Bob accepts, I make a good profit.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price in subsequent rounds based on his counteroffers.
* **Secure a Backup Plan:** I can always sell to John for $80 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a $150 budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still secure a higher price from Bob. 

* **Value to Bob:** Bob has stated that the product is worth $150 to him, so there's still room for negotiation.
* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially reach a price closer to my initial $120.

I'll counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, but below $120, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $110 for the product. This still gives you a good deal, considering its value to you.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $120 to $110, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him ($150) and emphasizing the ""good deal"" at $110.
* **Call to Action:** I'm urging Bob to accept the offer by suggesting a ""meet in the middle"" approach. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm still above Bob's offer, but demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Increase Chances of Agreement:**  The price is closer to Bob's offer, making acceptance more likely. 
* **Avoid Selling to John:**  $110 is significantly more than $80 from John, making this a preferable outcome."
