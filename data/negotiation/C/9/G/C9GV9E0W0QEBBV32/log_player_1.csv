This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that's attractive to Bob, but also leaves room for me to potentially earn more than my minimum target of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. It's a fair price considering its worth $120 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a little closer to my asking price.  How about $135? This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $132.50. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is very close to my ideal price and still significantly more than selling to John. Accepting his offer guarantees me a good profit."
