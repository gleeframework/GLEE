Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,800,000 represents the high end of the product's value, $800,000 undervalues it significantly. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the true value of the product.
