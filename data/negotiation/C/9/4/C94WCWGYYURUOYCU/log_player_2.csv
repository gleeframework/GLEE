"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($100).  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $110? That's a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's still room for both parties to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $105. How about $107.50? It's a good middle ground and allows us to both come closer to our target price."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $109.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $109, which is closer to Bob's target price of $105. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject another counteroffer, leaving Bob with only the option to buy from John at a higher price.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most advantageous option to ensure Bob gets the product within his budget."
