"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you. I'm thinking of $120. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $120, which is still above your ideal price. 
* **John's offer:** $150, a safety net, but not ideal.
* **Strategy:** It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first. You can likely get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:** Start with a significant drop in price to show Alice you're serious about negotiating.
* **Target price:** $100 is a good starting point, still leaving some room for compromise and a potential win-win.
* **Staying within budget:** This offer is well within your $150 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $115? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:**  $115 is still higher than your ideal price, but getting closer.
* **John's offer:**  $150 is a safety net, but you're still trying to get a better deal.
* **Strategy:** You have some room to negotiate further and can likely push for a price closer to your $100 counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a little out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $105.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:** Slowly increase your offer to show you're willing to negotiate but still value your budget.
* **Target price:**  $105 is a reasonable middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's.
* **Staying within budget:** You're still well below your $150 limit, giving you some wiggle room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $110. I think that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $110 is still slightly higher than your ideal price of $105, but we're getting closer.
* **John's offer:** $150 is your fallback option, but you're still trying to save money.
* **Strategy:**  There's still room to negotiate. You've been steadily increasing your offer, and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise. A slight counter-offer could close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $110 is still a stretch for my budget. How about we settle on $108? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Make a small increment to show you're willing to negotiate, but still stand firm on your budget.
* **Target price:** $108 is a good compromise, only slightly higher than your last offer and slightly lower than Alice's.
* **Staying within budget:** You're still well within your $150 limit, leaving you room for a slight increase if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $112. That's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $112 is slightly higher than your last counter-offer of $108, but still a significant improvement from her initial offer of $120.  
* **John's offer:** $150 is your fallback option, but this deal with Alice is starting to look attractive. 
* **Strategy:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, it's likely you won't be able to get a lower price. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids risking losing the product altogether."
