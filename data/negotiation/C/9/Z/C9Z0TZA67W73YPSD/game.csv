"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least get closer to my asking price.  How about $8,750?  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I truly believe this product is worth it to you. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm excited about the possibility of working with you.",8250.0,Bob,4,
