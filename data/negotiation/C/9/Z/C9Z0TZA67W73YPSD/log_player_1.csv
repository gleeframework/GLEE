Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $7,500 is too low for me, and I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I will try to counter Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least get closer to my asking price.  How about $8,750?  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I truly believe this product is worth it to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm excited about the possibility of working with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and it seems like Bob is serious about buying the product.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and ending up with the lower price from John."
