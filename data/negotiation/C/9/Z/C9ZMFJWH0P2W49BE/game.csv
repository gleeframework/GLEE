"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $15,500? This is still a good value for you, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel there might be room for negotiation. I would like to propose $15,000 as the price for the product. This aligns closely with its value to me and also brings us closer to the price point you initially mentioned. Please let me know if this is something we can work with.",15000.0,Bob,4,
