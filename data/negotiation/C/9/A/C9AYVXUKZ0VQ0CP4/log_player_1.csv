Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" motivates Bob to consider the deal more seriously and potentially avoid losing the opportunity. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies Alice is open to negotiation, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to maximize profit from Bob without completely alienating him and losing John as a guaranteed backup buyer."
