"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product, which is still a good price for you considering your value of $15000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $10500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to come down to $11500. This price allows for some flexibility on both sides, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a fair offer. Let's work together to close this deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $11500 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10500. I'm willing to offer $11000. This price is still above my maximum, but demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually agreeable solution.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11250. This price is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll see it as a fair value.  Let's seal this deal and make it work for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
