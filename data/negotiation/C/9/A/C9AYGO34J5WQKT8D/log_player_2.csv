"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get the product for $15,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's, but Bob can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer.  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, but it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  By offering $13,000, Bob is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $14,000 but still above Alice's minimum of $12,000. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save a decent amount compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to Bob's target of saving as much money as possible. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer and Bob having to pay John's price is too high.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
