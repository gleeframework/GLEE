Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're not giving the product away for less than it's worth to you.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential for him to counteroffer and still make a profit.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher offer might make Bob immediately reject it, so starting a bit lower allows for a more gradual negotiation.

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, there's still potential for a better deal. Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to continue the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price closer to our desired $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, showing we're willing to negotiate, but it's still lower than our initial offer, leaving room for a possible final agreement."
