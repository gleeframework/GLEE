"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This would be a fair price considering I'm still saving a significant amount from your initial asking price.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
