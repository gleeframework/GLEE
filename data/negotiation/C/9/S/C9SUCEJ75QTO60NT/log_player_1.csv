Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This would be a fair price considering I'm still saving a significant amount from your initial asking price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
