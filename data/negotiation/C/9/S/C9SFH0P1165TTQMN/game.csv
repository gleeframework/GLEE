"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to buy, but the price is a little high for me. How about we settle on $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to a price I can agree on. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to think that's the best I can do. Let's see if we can make it work.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your position.  This is my final offer, if you can't accept it, I'll have to go with another seller.  $1,037,000.",1037000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,037,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one last offer of $1,080,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1080000.0,Alice,9,
