This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's  higher than Bob's perceived value but still attractive enough for him to consider. This leaves room for negotiation if necessary.  I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value to him to incentivize a deal."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between its value to me and your potential profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can achieve a better price through continued negotiation."

While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if I can reach a compromise."

Bob's final offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result. It's time to move on and sell to John for a much better price."
