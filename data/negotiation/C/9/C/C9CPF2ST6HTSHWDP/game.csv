,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $92?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $92 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. Let's close this deal.",95.0,Alice,5,
