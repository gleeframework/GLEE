"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Staying Reasonable:**  While I'm aiming low, I don't want to lowball to the point of insulting Alice. This offer is still a decent profit margin for her.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I expect Alice to counter, and this offer leaves space for us to potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $100? That's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, which is a good sign.  However, $100 is still a significant markup from her value ($80). I'm confident I can get a better deal by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $92? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 92
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between her last offer ($100) and my previous counteroffer ($85). This shows willingness to compromise while still moving closer to my target price.
* **Clear Communication:** Using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""fair compromise"" emphasizes a collaborative approach to the negotiation.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  I want to keep the negotiation moving and avoid getting stuck in a stalemate."
