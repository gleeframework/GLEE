"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise at $110, which is still a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really trying to make this work, Alice, but $110 is still too high for me.  If you're serious about selling, I'm willing to go up to $100. This is my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already told you that I'm not willing to sell for $100. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer: $115, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.",115.0,Alice,7,
