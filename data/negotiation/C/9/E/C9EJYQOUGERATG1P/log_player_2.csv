"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no information about the product's actual value to her.  It's always worth trying to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price. If negotiations fail, you can always buy from John as a backup."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,200,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the purchase.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which I believe is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your price point, but there's still room for negotiation. You can try to push for a lower price by counteroffering again. You're still saving money compared to buying from John, so continuing the negotiation makes sense."
