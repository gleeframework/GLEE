"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1200000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the purchase.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which I believe is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1350000.  While this is getting closer, I'm still a bit hesitant.  To make this work for me, I'd need to come in at $1300000.  This is a significant price difference for me, but I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
