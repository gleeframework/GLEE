"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to save money, $100 is still a good price, but it's worth trying to negotiate lower.  There are still 9 rounds to go, so it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and hopefully encourages Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to my target, it's still above my desired price point. With 7 rounds remaining, I want to see if I can push Alice further before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility. This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway while still trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is getting closer to my target price of $80. However, with only 5 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for a lower price and having Alice walk away.  $92 is a good price, and I'm confident I've saved a significant amount compared to buying from John."
