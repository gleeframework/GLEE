"I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $125. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $135.

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $125. Would you be willing to meet me at $128? It's still a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",128.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $128. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $132. It's the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",132.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're making a concession, Alice, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $128.
