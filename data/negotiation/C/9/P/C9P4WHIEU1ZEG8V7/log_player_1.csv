"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price of $10,000.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  There are still many rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to make a bit more for this product. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's a fair compromise, and it still allows me to get what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $10,500. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,500 is above my minimum price of $10,000 and is a good deal considering we've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation. It's better to close the deal now than to risk losing more time and potentially getting a lower offer in the future."
