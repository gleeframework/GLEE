"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $12,000 right away.  Since you can buy the product from John for the same price, it makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice first. There's a chance she's willing to sell for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $10,000. This is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. If she rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer in subsequent rounds based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above my desired price point. It's better than her initial offer, but I can still try to negotiate further.  I want to see if she's willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $11,000.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to accept her previous price. It's a reasonable compromise that might lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, but it's still higher than I'd like.  I'm going to keep negotiating and see if I can get her down further.  I have a few rounds left and can always buy from John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a counteroffer of $11,250. This is a mid-point between Alice's offer and my last offer. It shows I am willing to meet her halfway, but also demonstrates I'm serious about getting a better price. With only a few rounds left, it's time to start closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reverted back to her initial price of $12,000. This suggests she might not be willing to budge further.  With only a few rounds left, I'm running out of time. It's more efficient to accept John's offer of $12,000 and avoid further negotiation."
