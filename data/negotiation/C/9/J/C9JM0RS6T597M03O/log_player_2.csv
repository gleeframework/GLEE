"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a good profit on this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm going to need a lower price to make this work.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum value, and I believe it still gives you a solid profit. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to make a significant profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  While it's closer to my target price, I can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good profit, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's try to close this deal and avoid going back and forth further."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,320,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to you and my original asking price. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, she's still above my target price.  I've already made two counteroffers, and the negotiation process is becoming time-consuming.  Since I have a guaranteed deal with John for $1,200,000, it's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
