Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm going to need a lower price to make this work.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum value, and I believe it still gives you a solid profit. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's try to close this deal and avoid going back and forth further.
