"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This initial offer leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit.  It's important to be confident and highlight the value to Bob, while leaving room for a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit. I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is still a great deal for you, given its value. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe we can reach a better agreement. I'll counteroffer and see if we can close the deal in the next few rounds."
