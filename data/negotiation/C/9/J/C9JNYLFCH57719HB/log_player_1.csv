Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $9,500."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, and you can still likely settle above your minimum price of $8,000.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob."
