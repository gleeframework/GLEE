"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, but I have to let you know that I'm open to negotiating. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's starting price is way above your budget and what you know John will sell it for.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting her initial offer is the best move."
