Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:**  Since Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000, she has room to negotiate above that price. Starting at $1,200,000 allows for potential negotiation downward while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Exclusivity and Urgency:**  The message creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency, making Bob feel like he has a limited-time advantage. This can encourage a quicker decision in Alice's favor.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice is secure knowing that if Bob rejects the offer, she can sell to John for her minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Information:** This strategy assumes Alice has a good understanding of the product's value and potential demand.  If there are many similar products on the market, a lower price might be more strategic.
* **Bob's Personality:** Alice might adjust her approach based on any prior knowledge of Bob's negotiating style."
