Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999.  I think it's a great deal for something of this quality, and I'm keen to find it a good home.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Psychological Pricing:** $11,999 feels significantly cheaper than $12,000 to most buyers, even though the difference is minimal.
* **Urgency (subtle):** By mentioning you want to ""find it a good home,"" you subtly imply there might be other interested parties, even though John is your backup.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to consider."
