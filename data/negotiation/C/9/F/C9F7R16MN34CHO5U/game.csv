"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $8500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go below 8800. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit hesitant about $8800.  How about we split the difference and go with $8600?  That's a fair compromise that would allow us to reach an agreement.",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as 8600. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll offer you 8700. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",8700.0,Alice,5,
