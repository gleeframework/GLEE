"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  You value the product at $120 and Alice is offering it for $100. This means you have room to negotiate for a better price.
* **You have the advantage of John's offer.** Knowing you can buy the product from John for $120 gives you leverage to negotiate a lower price with Alice. 

By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm hoping to get a better deal. How about $90?  I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is now offering $95, which is only $5 more than your counteroffer.** This is a good deal for you, considering you're willing to pay up to $120.
* **Negotiating further might not be worth it.** You could try to push for a lower price, but there's a risk Alice will reject your offer again, forcing you to either buy from John or continue negotiating indefinitely.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice to get the product at a reasonable price and avoid any further haggling."
