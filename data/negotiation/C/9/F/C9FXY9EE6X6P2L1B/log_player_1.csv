{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message to build rapport and sets a price that is a good starting point for negotiation. It's above my minimum acceptable price ($80) but still leaves room for bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $80, it's still below what I'd like to get. I believe I can push for a higher price, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price of $95. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering my budget, Alice. I'll increase my offer to $87.50 if that helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $87.50 isn't ideal, it's a good compromise.  I'm getting closer to my desired price and it's much better than selling to John for $80.  I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
