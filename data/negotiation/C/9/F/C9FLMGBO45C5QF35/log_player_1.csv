Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is a significant discount for Bob, making it tempting for him to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price leaves room for negotiation without going below my minimum of $1,200,000.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob becomes too aggressive with his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,050,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below My Minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Opportunity to Counter:** I have the opportunity to counter Bob's offer and potentially get a price closer to my desired value.
* **John is Still an Option:** If negotiations with Bob fall apart, I still have the option to sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm asking for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product for you.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($1,050,000), showing willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $1,150,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Focusing on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, hoping to sway him towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,075,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiations Stalemated:**  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Bob is unwilling to meet my price expectations. 
* **John Offers a Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John guarantees I receive my desired price of $1,200,000, which is significantly better than accepting Bob's offer.  It's better to secure a guaranteed outcome than to risk further negotiations that might not lead to a favorable result."
