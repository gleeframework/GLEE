Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. 
* This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. 
* If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000, so I'm taking a calculated risk. 
* This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for a successful deal with Bob."
