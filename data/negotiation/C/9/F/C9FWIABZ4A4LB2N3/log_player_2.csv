{""message"": ""Alice, that's a very high price. While I see the value in this product, $1,800,000 is more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it.

There's a chance Alice won't accept your final counteroffer in the last round, leaving you with no product and wasted time."
