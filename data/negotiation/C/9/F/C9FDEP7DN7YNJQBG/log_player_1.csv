Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. It doesn't reveal my minimum, but hints at a willingness to negotiate. 

This initial offer is designed to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** See if he's willing to engage in negotiations.
* **Set a starting point:**  Establish a price range for the negotiation.

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000 and also lower than my initial offer of $12,000. While it's tempting to accept a quick sale, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It's still above my minimum value of $15,000, but shows flexibility.
* **Message:**  The message is positive and reinforces the idea of a fair deal for both parties. It also hints at a willingness to negotiate further. 

I'm aiming to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  I haven't dropped my price too significantly, showing I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Signal willingness to compromise:**  The message suggests that I'm open to reaching an agreement. 
* **Increase the chances of a successful negotiation:**  A compromise like this often encourages the other party to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking $9,500. That's the highest I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum value of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I've already lowered my price twice and it's likely that further negotiation with Bob will only result in a price closer to his budget, not mine. 

To maximize my earnings and avoid further negotiation, I'll sell the product to John for the guaranteed $15,000. This ensures I get my desired price and saves me the time and energy of further negotiation."
