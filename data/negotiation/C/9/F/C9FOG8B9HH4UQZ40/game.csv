"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price for the value you'll get.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $8,500? This would give you a great deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's close this deal!",8500.0,Alice,5,
