"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** $12,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a raw deal. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation positive and open to possibilities."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below his own perceived value of $8,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** I believe I can get a much better price by continuing the negotiation.  
* **John is a safe option.**  While I'm open to getting a better deal with Bob, I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, which I can fall back on if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price for the value you'll get.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not immediately going to John. This shows I'm open to negotiation but also sets a clear lower limit.
* **Moving closer to Bob:**  $9,000 is still above his initial offer but significantly closer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:** I reiterate the product's value and frame the offer as beneficial for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, $7,500 is still significantly below my desired price.
* **More negotiation room:** I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation.
* **John is a fallback:** I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if this negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $8,500? This would give you a great deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting the deal:** I emphasize the value Bob would receive at this price point, making the offer more appealing.
* **Urgency and closure:**  I add a touch of urgency (""Let's close this deal!"") to encourage Bob to accept."
