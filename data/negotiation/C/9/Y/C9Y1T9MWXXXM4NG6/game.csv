"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can we meet in the middle at $1750000?",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1750000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $1900000 to make this worthwhile.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1950000? ",1950000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1950000. I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Can we meet in the middle at $1825000?,1825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1825000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference and go with $1862500. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset. What do you say?",1862500.0,Alice,5,
