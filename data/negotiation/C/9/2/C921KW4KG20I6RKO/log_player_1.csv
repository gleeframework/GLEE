Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm aiming for a higher price than $130, and I still have time to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $132.50 is still above my minimum and a better deal than selling to John."
