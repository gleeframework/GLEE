Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000,  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium over his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value to entice Bob without revealing my guaranteed sale to John. 
 
This approach aims to get the best possible price from Bob while having the security of John's offer as a backup."
