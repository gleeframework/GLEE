"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **The goal is to save money.** $100 is still a decent price, but there's potential to get it lower.
* **There are 9 more rounds to negotiate.** This gives plenty of room to try and get a better deal. 
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers.**  This is the best strategy to see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive start:**  A lower counteroffer shows you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Room for negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter without going below my maximum of $120. 
* **Testing the waters:** This will reveal how much Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for improvement:** $90 is closer to my goal, but I'm still not at my ideal price. 
* **Further negotiation:** It's worth continuing to see if Alice is willing to go lower. I have more rounds to try.
* **Avoid buying from John:**  Buying from John right now would mean paying more than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Alice's last offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not accepting her last offer, keeping the pressure on her to come down. 
* **Reasonable offer:** $85 is still within my budget and likely a good price for Alice."
