,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do appreciate the product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I was initially thinking.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $110. Let me know if you're willing to go that low.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $125? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good deal for you.",125.0,Alice,5,
