Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [Product Name] for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than your minimum value of $10,000.  It leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially earn more.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product without revealing too much about your own needs. 

**Why this approach?**

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  The high starting price will help determine if Bob is seriously interested in the product and has a budget that aligns with your expectations.
* **Initiate the negotiation:** By presenting a clear offer, you start the negotiation process and give Bob a starting point for his own counteroffer. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives you confidence to walk away if the negotiations don't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the [Product Name].  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still lower than your desired profit margin.  Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting, you show Bob that you're not desperate to sell and are willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Continue negotiating:**  You can now counter with a higher offer, hoping to bridge the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer. 
* **Explore alternatives:** While you might not be able to secure your full asking price, you can still try to get closer to your desired value through further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to formulate a counteroffer to Bob, taking into account his offer of $12,000 and your minimum price of $10,000.  A reasonable counteroffer might be somewhere between $13,000 and $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand that $15,000 was a bit high.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500 for the [Product Name]. This still gives you a great deal on a high-quality product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** The counteroffer of $13,500 is a compromise that meets you halfway while still maintaining a decent profit margin. It's a significant reduction from your initial offer, showing you're willing to negotiate, but not too low that you're giving away too much. 
* **Positive Messaging:** The message remains friendly and focuses on the value of the product to Bob.  It avoids language that might be perceived as aggressive or desperate.

**Why this approach?**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Signal flexibility:**  By lowering your price, you show Bob you're open to compromise.
* **Maintain profitability:**  $13,500 is still a healthy profit for you, allowing you to meet your financial goals.
* **Encourage acceptance:**  By presenting a clear offer that bridges the gap between your previous price and Bob's offer, you increase the likelihood of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $13500 is closer to my budget, I'm still only able to offer $12500.  This feels like a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below your ideal price, it's very close to your minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  Accepting this offer means:

* **Securing a sale:** This guarantees you a sale, as you know that Bob is willing to pay this price.
* **Minimizing risk:**  By accepting, you avoid the risk of further negotiation, which might lead to a lower price or a prolonged process.
* **Making a profit:**  While it's not your highest potential earning, $12,500 is still a decent profit on the product, allowing you to meet your financial goals. 

**Why not continue negotiating?**

While continuing the negotiation could potentially result in a higher price, it also comes with risks:

* **Time and effort:**  Further negotiation takes time and energy. 
* **Stalemate:** There's no guarantee you'll reach a higher price, and you risk reaching a stalemate where no agreement is reached.
* **Losing the deal:**  If you become too inflexible, Bob might walk away, leaving you with the lower price from John. 

Given the proximity of Bob's offer to your minimum value, accepting the offer minimizes risk and ensures a quick, profitable sale."
