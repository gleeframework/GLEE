"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $10,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($12,000), so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It states the price and gives Bob a reason to consider your offer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can only pay $9,500 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a decent price, it's still lower than the initial offer I made.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target. I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still leaving me with a profitable deal.
* **Reinforcing value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, encouraging him to see the worth in a slightly higher price.
* **Urgency:**  Adding ""Let's close this deal!""  creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept."
