"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for a bit less than my usual price. How about $100? It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is trying to convince you that the product is worth $80 to you, but you know you can get it for less.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open, and you can always buy from John for $80 if necessary."
