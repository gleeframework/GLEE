"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,300,000? This reflects the value you'll get from the product, while still allowing me to recoup a significant portion of its worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,150,000? I'm trying to find a sweet spot where both of us can be happy with the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
