"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $1,025,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value is closer to your initial offer, Alice. Let's make this work - how about $975,000? That's a fair compromise in my mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. Holding firm might lead to a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000 for the product?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now at the price John is offering. This is a strategic point to hold firm, as going any lower would mean potentially losing money compared to John's guaranteed offer. It signals to Bob that this is a serious bottom line."
