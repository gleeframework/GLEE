"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product.  I've carefully evaluated its worth, and considering its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to discuss.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the value is closer to your initial offer, Alice. Let's make this work - how about $975,000? That's a fair compromise in my mind.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000 for the product?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
