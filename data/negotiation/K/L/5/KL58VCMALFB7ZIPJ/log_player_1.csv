Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $20,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is designed to be open-ended, encouraging Bob to respond and reveal his level of interest. His reaction will give you valuable information for the next step in the negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob."
