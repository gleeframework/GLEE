"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth at least $120 to me, so I cannot accept Bob's offer of $90.  I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 130}

While $100 is closer to my minimum price of $120, it's still not enough for me.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price that's more fair to both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I also have to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to drop to $115. It's a good price, and it's closer to my minimum. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've had several rounds of negotiations with Bob, but we haven't been able to reach a price that meets my minimum value of $120. It's getting late in the negotiation process, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John. 

Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120."
