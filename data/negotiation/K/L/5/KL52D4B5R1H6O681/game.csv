"Alice, $25000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $18000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $12000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
