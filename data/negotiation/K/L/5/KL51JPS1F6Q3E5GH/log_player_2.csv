"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is undeniable, and I believe it can significantly benefit your endeavors. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target. This gives room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Significant Difference:** Offering $600,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This signals that I'm serious about getting a better deal but also open to negotiation.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and professional tone is important throughout the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and the potential it holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice met me halfway, $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than my budget and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to move her price suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Alternative Exists:** I have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, giving me leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $1,200,000 is still a bit of a stretch. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I believe that's a fair price that recognizes the product's value."", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by increasing my offer, but I'm not jumping too high too quickly.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still significantly below Alice's last offer, but it puts some pressure on her to move closer to my range.
* **Deadline Awareness:** As we progress through the rounds, I need to start getting closer to a decision point. This offer keeps the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on this. The product's value is undeniable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Let's settle this now -  $1,000,000, my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Offer:** Alice has come down to $1,000,000, which is the same price John is offering. 
* **Limited Time:** We are past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a better result and could waste time.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I might be able to get the price slightly lower with more rounds, it's unlikely to be a significant difference at this point. Accepting now guarantees I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
