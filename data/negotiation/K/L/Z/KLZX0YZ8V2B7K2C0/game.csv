"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I am hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, but is closer to your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still looking for something closer to my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $1,050,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This price is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while also giving you a good deal. ",1075000.0,Alice,5,
