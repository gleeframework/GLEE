Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $11,250 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to drop to $12,000, which is my absolute minimum. It's a fair price for the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has come down to her minimum price, which matches what you can get it for from John. There's no further room for negotiation and it's not worth risking losing the product at this price."
