"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $200 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point.  It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also keeps us well below our $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price. Let's counter again and see if we can get closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $130? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

We're getting closer to a price that works for us. This offer splits the difference between her last offer and our previous one, hoping for a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still negotiating, Bob! I can do $145, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is down to $145, which is close enough to our $150 walk-away price. It's not worth the risk of her going higher or the effort of another round.  This seems like a good deal!"
