"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first. $140 is close to my limit, but there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me, though. Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation. This tactic aims to see how flexible she is on price.
* **Staying Above Alice's Value:** Offering $110 ensures I'm still proposing a price that's profitable for Alice, making it more likely she'll continue the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I'm prepared to go up from $110 if needed, but I want to see if I can secure a deal closer to Alice's minimum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $125 is a fair compromise. It's significantly lower than my initial limit of $150 and only slightly above Alice's value.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in a slightly better price, but there's also the risk Alice walks away, and I end up paying $150 to John. 
* **Time Saved:**  Accepting now avoids further back-and-forth negotiation."
