"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. This still leaves some room for us both to get a good outcome. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about making this deal work. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,075,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but it shows my commitment to finding a solution that benefits us both.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit further and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this offer?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $1,025,000 simply won't work for me. To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,050,000.  This reflects a further concession on my part and brings us much closer to a deal.  Let's finalize this agreement!",1050000.0,Alice,7,
