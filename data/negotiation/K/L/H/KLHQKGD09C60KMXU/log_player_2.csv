"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than John's price of $15,000, it's still significantly higher than your maximum valuation.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're willing to walk away unless you get a better deal. This might lead her to lower the price further."
