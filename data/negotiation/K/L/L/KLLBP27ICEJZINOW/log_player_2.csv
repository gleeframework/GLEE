# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, as it's still below what I would get from another buyer. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.
