"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This leaves significant room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exceptional value"" without revealing specifics. This aims to pique Bob's interest and justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's input, setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation.

By starting high, we gain valuable information about Bob's willingness to pay and establish a strong position for subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting price is a bit too high for me. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. We have room to negotiate and try to guide Bob closer to our target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a significant gap from what I consider fair value for this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial concession on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal through with you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** We're lowering our price by $300,000, a substantial move that might signal flexibility to Bob. However, we're still well above both his offer and our minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Value and Concession:** The message reiterates the product's value while highlighting our significant price reduction as a gesture of goodwill.
* **Maintain a Firm Stance:**  The tone remains confident and emphasizes our desired price point, aiming to guide Bob's expectations upward. 

We're aiming to reach a compromise but not rushing into a deal below our target range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This represents a significant investment on my part and is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's standing offer of $1,500,000, which is also our minimum acceptable price. While we aimed for a higher price, there's no guarantee we could secure a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds. Accepting now ensures a favorable outcome and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
