"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you on this amazing product! I'm willing to let it go for $90, a steal considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is a decent price, you know you can get the product for $100 from John if you reject Alice's offer. This gives you some negotiating power."
