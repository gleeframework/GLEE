"Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for $200,000 less from Alice than from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $500,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $600,000. This is still a good deal for me, as it's $300,000 less than buying from John. I'm hoping Alice will see the value in accepting this offer, as it's still a good price for her, considering her minimum is $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is willing to go down to $650,000. This is still a good price, but I can likely get it even lower by continuing to negotiate.  It's worth one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $550,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $500,000 and Alice's latest offer of $650,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to meet her halfway.  Hopefully, this will be enough to seal the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $675,000, which is only $25,000 lower than her previous offer.  It's unlikely we'll be able to close the gap further with more negotiation. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $800,000, as I'm guaranteed to get the product at a known price without further negotiation."
