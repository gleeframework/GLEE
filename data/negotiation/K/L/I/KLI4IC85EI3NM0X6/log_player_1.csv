"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** By mentioning ""open to negotiation,"" I encourage Bob to counteroffer and engage in the process. 
* **Positive tone:** Using phrases like ""amazing product"" and ""really love it"" aims to create a positive initial impression."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is exactly at that minimum. I believe I can likely get more by continuing the negotiation. By rejecting the offer, I can try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's meet halfway at $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I'm starting my counteroffer by acknowledging Bob's offer and showing appreciation for his interest.
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($150) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. Would you be willing to consider $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved up from his initial $120 offer to $125.  This is a reasonable compromise and gets me closer to my initial target.  It's important to consider that we only have 6 rounds left, and while I could try to get more, it's risky.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale above my minimum, and I still have rounds left to potentially explore a sale to John if a better offer doesn't materialize."
