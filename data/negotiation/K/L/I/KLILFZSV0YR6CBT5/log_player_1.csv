"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with an ambitious offer significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" and ""significant benefits,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher point.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This initial high offer sets the stage for us to potentially concede ground in later rounds while still aiming for a final price that's highly profitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is not as high as you think. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits I'll receive from this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than our target price and only slightly below John's guaranteed offer.  We have room to negotiate and aim higher.  We'll counter in the next round to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, I believe your offer undervalues some key benefits this product brings, particularly in [mention a specific area where the product will benefit Bob's business]. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000."" ,
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** We're making a significant concession to demonstrate our willingness to negotiate but are still anchoring the price well above both Bob's offer and our minimum. We're justifying the price by highlighting specific benefits relevant to Bob's business.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be.  A substantial counter from him would indicate potential for a deal above our minimum. If his next offer isn't much higher, we'll have to seriously consider John's offer in the following round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your points about the benefits, Alice, but I still think the price is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the benefits I'll receive from this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, moving closer to our range with each offer. While $1,800,000 is tempting, we are still in early rounds and he's conceding ground. We believe there's potential to push for a higher price, closer to $2,000,000, before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway again. To show my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and the substantial returns it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're making a smaller concession this time ($50,000), signaling that we're nearing our bottom line.  The language ""final offer"" adds weight and encourages Bob to take this offer seriously.
* **Value Focus:** We're reiterating the value proposition, emphasizing the ""substantial returns"" to keep Bob focused on the long-term benefits, potentially outweighing his initial price concerns.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts us in a strong position. If Bob accepts, we've secured a great price. If he rejects it, we're still above John's offer and can confidently walk away knowing we negotiated effectively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I still think the price is too high. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1,700,000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope you can meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated that $1,700,000 is his maximum price. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant increase.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or reaching an impasse, potentially costing us a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.
* **Time Value:** By accepting John's offer, we secure a guaranteed profit immediately and avoid the uncertainty and time investment of further negotiation.

While there's a chance we could extract a slightly higher price from Bob, it's a risk we're not willing to take at this point. John's offer provides a strong safety net and allows us to achieve a highly favorable outcome."
