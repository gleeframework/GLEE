You should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's better to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and  forces her to consider a lower price.  We can adjust from here based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice has come down to my maximum budget. It's not ideal, but it's a good deal considering she initially wanted $2,000,000.  Accepting her offer means I get the product at the best possible price without risking going over budget or having to continue negotiating."
