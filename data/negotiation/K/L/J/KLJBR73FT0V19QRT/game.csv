"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1500000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to consider a price of $1100000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that it's a price that reflects the product's value. I'm now willing to consider a price of $1050000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
