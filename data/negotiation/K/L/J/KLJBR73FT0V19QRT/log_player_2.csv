"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1500000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:**  $900,000 is still a substantial amount, giving Alice some space to negotiate without feeling like she's giving away the farm.
* **Sets the Stage:**  This establishes your willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to consider a price of $1100000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,100,000 is still above your $1,000,000 limit. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** There are still several rounds left, and Alice has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate.  You might be able to get closer to your desired price with another counteroffer. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  There's always the possibility of reaching a better deal, especially as the rounds progress and the pressure for Alice to close a deal might increase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** This counteroffer emphasizes that you are serious and willing to walk away if this offer isn't accepted. 
* **Fairness:**  $1,000,000 is your absolute maximum, so it's a fair price from your perspective.
* **Pressure:** By stating this is your final offer, you put the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that it's a price that reflects the product's value. I'm now willing to consider a price of $1050000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** You have only five rounds left, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.
* **Secure Alternative:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a guaranteed deal within your budget. It's a safer choice to avoid the risk of continued negotiation and potentially losing out on the product altogether."
