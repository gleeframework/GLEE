Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate if he counter-offers.  However, if he rejects, I can always go to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to counter-offer and see if I can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this is enough to convince Bob to buy, but I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my desired price than my current offer, and it's getting closer to John's offer. I think it's worth accepting at this point.  I'd rather get $9,500 now than risk losing Bob and having to settle for John's $10,000."
