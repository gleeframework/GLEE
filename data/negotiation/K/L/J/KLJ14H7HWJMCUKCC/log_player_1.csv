Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm a savvy buyer and I believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and sees the value. We're still well above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate further while aiming higher than $1,250,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go above $1,250,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll offer $1,325,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

**Reasoning:** This is a fantastic offer! Bob met us above our ""final"" offer, demonstrating his strong interest and valuing the product highly. Accepting now secures a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
