"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to me.  Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can find a price that better suits both of us. How about considering $1,250,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  
* I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting his offer and counter-offering gives me more room to maneuver. 
* It's crucial to hold out for a price closer to my minimum value, as selling to John for $1,500,000 is a viable backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose $1,400,000 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
*  I'm only on round 4, so there's still time to push for a higher price.
*  It's too risky to accept his offer, as selling to John for $1,500,000 is a more profitable option.  
* I will continue to counter-offer with the aim of reaching a price closer to my minimum value."

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches my minimum acceptable value.
