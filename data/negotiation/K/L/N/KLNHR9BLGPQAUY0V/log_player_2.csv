**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her value of the product, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm confident that this product will bring you a significant return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Alice's new offer of $1,325,000 is closer to Bob's budget, but it's still above his preferred price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob another chance to try to lower the price further."
