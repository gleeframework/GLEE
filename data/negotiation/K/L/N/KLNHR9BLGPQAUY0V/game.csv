"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your portfolio. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product,  which is a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm confident that this product will bring you a significant return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise and a good value for the product's potential. Let's finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
