Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This leaves room for potential negotiation and allows you to earn more than your minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum desired price of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is just too low. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $115?  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $112.50 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable going below $120. It's better to sell to John for a guaranteed $120 than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
