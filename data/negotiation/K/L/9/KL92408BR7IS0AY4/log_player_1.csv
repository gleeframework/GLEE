"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit.  I'm confident Bob will want this product and might be willing to pay a premium, but I'm not going to risk too much by starting too high. We'll see how the negotiation goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is a good price, but I think I can do better. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping it will be attractive enough for Bob to accept.  We're getting closer to a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe I can get closer to $13,500 in the next round, and I'm confident I can get a better deal than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $13,000. Bob has shown that he's willing to negotiate, and I want to make sure we reach an agreement.  This price is still very good for me, and I think it's likely Bob will accept."
