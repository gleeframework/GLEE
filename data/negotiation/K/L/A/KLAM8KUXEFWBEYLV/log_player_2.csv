"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,400,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers you will be well worth it. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover the value I see in this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll reap from owning this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000. Further negotiation might yield a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and losing the deal altogether is too high. Accepting the offer at $1,300,000 is the most financially sensible decision."
