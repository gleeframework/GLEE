Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $8800 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $8,800 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's too far below what I'm hoping to get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $8,800 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum expectation for this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,200. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $9,000 is a good compromise, and it's closer to my minimum price point.  While I could potentially get more from John, there's a risk that the negotiation with Bob might break down completely. It's better to secure the deal now and avoid the uncertainty."
