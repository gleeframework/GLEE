Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $120 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on it, while still leaving him with a perceived gain ($30). This price also ensures you make a profit well above your minimum if he accepts. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have a reasonable belief that Bob will be willing to pay a price significantly higher than your minimum.  If you suspect Bob is very price-sensitive, you might lower your offer slightly to increase the chance of a sale."
