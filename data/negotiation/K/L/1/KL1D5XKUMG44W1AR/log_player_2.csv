"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
You are willing to pay $12,000 max, and Alice is asking for $13,500. It's more beneficial to you to buy from John, even if it means missing out on the possible slight discount you could negotiate with Alice."
