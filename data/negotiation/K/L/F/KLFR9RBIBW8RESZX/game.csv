"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product. However, I have a tight budget for this purchase.  Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget constraint, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $920,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price. Let's meet in the middle at $920,000.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $860,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $900,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. Let's see if we can meet at $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a fair offer, and I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, I'm ready to close this deal today. How about we split the difference one last time and agree on $880,000?",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your eagerness to close the deal, and I'm glad we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $880,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $885,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap up the deal today.",885000.0,Alice,7,
