"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $120 is not ideal. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 
 
This is a reasonable counteroffer. It's below Alice's desired price but still acknowledges the product's value. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum value. Rejecting allows for another round of negotiation and potentially getting closer to the $80 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This counteroffer increases Bob's offer by $10, showing that he's willing to negotiate, but also keeping the price within his budget. It's a reasonable compromise that may tempt Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer of $105 is still above Bob's maximum value of $80.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $80, it's the most financially sound decision for Bob to buy from John.  Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but it's not worth the risk of potentially losing the product to another buyer while also risking more time and effort."
