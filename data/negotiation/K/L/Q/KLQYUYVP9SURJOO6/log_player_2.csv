"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $150 to me, and Alice is offering it for $120. While this is a good deal, I can likely get a better price by negotiating further. I'll reject the offer and try to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to land somewhere in the middle. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but $130 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can push her lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my strategy of making incremental counteroffers.  $110 is a reasonable compromise point, and hopefully, Alice will see it's in her best interest to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is moving in the wrong direction.  I'm still determined to get the product for less than $150, and I'm not willing to pay more than my initial counteroffer of $110. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Alice to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my last counteroffer of $110.  This is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident that Alice will eventually come around, especially since she's already rejected a higher offer. It's also worth noting that if she rejects this offer, I can always choose to purchase the product from John for $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is not getting any closer to my desired price. I've tried my best to negotiate, but it seems like she's not willing to budge much.  I'm running out of time and rounds, so I'm better off buying the product from John.  It's $5 more than my preferred price, but it's a guaranteed deal, and it's still less than what Alice is offering."
