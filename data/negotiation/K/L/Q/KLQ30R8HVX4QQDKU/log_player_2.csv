"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe could significantly enhance the efficiency and profitability of your operations. Given its high quality and unique features, I am confident it will be a valuable addition to your business. I am extending an exclusive offer to you for $15000. This price reflects not only the product's intrinsic value but also the opportunity to secure it at a special rate. I look forward to hearing your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 and Alice's offer is also $15,000, there's no immediate benefit to accepting her offer.  You can always go with John, who you know will sell you the product for your maximum price. 

Rejecting Alice's offer might open the door for her to negotiate a lower price to secure the deal, but it doesn't hurt to see if she's willing to budge."
