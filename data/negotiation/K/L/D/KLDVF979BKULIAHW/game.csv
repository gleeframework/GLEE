"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too steep for me. This product would be useful, but I'm only willing to spend around $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $10,000 is still higher than I'd prefer. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal! I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is still a bit above what you mentioned, but I'm trying to be reasonable. Let me know if this works for you!",8500.0,Alice,5,
