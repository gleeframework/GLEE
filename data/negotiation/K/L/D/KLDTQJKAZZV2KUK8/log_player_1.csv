Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My starting price is $950,000. This reflects its inherent value and potential for your business.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 
* **John's offer:**  While John offers a guaranteed $800,000, I want to see if I can push for a higher price with Bob first. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 3."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $700,000 is simply too far below the product's true worth. To reflect its value and still be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000. This price offers a significant advantage to you while still ensuring a worthwhile return for me.  I'm open to discussing further adjustments but need to stay within a realistic range."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a little more manageable.  Would you consider $750,000?  I'm serious about this product and believe this offer represents a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **John's offer:** While John offers a guaranteed $800,000, I am committed to seeing if I can secure a better deal with Bob. I want to see if I can squeeze out a slightly higher price by offering a counteroffer.
* **Negotiation potential:** There is still room for negotiation as Bob is clearly interested in the product.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 5."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but  $750,000 just isn't a number that works for me. However, I value your interest and am willing to make a final concession.  How about $825,000?  This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and is still fair considering the product's value to you. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This is a big decision for me, and I want to make sure we get it right. I'm prepared to offer $780,000.  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping you'll see it as a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close but not enough:** While $780,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it still falls short. 
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk further negotiations and potentially end up with a lower price than John's offer.
* **John's offer is a sure thing:** John offers a guaranteed $800,000, which is my minimum threshold and a safe option.

**Next Steps:** I will sell the product to John to ensure a deal at my minimum acceptable price."
