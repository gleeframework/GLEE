"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's perfect for you! I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe there's potential to reach a more favorable deal.
* Selling to John immediately would guarantee me $100, but I'm hoping to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but $65 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, I have a strict budget, and $95 is still pushing it.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* I'm not satisfied with his counteroffers and believe there's still potential for a more favorable deal.
* Selling to John guarantees me $100, but I'm aiming to get closer to that amount. 
*  I have 6 rounds left and am confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $75 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product, and I'm confident you won't regret it! Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I can do $80, and I think that's a fair compromise. It's the most I can offer, but I'm ready to make the purchase today if you're happy with this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $80 is only $20 less than my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* This is a good compromise considering his limited budget.
* I have 4 rounds left, but I don't want to risk losing this sale and potentially having to settle for a lower offer later. 
* Accepting this offer is the best option at this point, as it gets me closer to my desired price and secures a sale."
