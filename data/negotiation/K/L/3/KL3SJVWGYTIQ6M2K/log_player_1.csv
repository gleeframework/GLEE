Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to find a price that Bob accepts, netting you the most profit above your $1,200,000 minimum. Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair price given its potential worth to your business."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Target Price:**  Aiming for $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a perceived gain of $100,000 compared to his valuation, making it more likely he'll accept. 
* **Message Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value to Bob while still being firm about the price.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You have some leeway to negotiate down towards $1,250,000 but hold firm to maximize your profit.
* **Information is Key:** This assumes you don't know Bob's exact maximum willingness to pay. If you had more information about Bob's financial situation or the product's specific value to him, you could refine your offer further."
