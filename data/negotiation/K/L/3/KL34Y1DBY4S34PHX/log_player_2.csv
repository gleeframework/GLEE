"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $950,000. I understand its worth more to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your ideal price point. You're looking to spend less than $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a better price with her or secure a lower price from another seller."
