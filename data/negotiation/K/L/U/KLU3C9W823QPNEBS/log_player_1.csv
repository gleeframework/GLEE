Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.  Any price within this range could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob immediately walks away. Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm confident it will deliver significant value. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair offer considering the long-term benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  You start by highlighting the product's value, framing it positively.
* **Strong but Negotiable Price:**  $1,400,000 is a strong opening, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Rationale:** You provide a brief justification for the price, focusing on the value proposition.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you need to sell quickly, a lower price might be more appealing.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a more moderate opening price could be better.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially adjust your price based on Bob's response."
