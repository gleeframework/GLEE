"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value you place on the product.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000, but I can compromise a bit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for both parties.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
