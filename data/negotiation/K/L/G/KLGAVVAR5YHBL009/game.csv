"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This is my absolute top price, as I have another option available at that amount. Let me know if you're willing to come down.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
