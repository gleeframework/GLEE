Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.

You should buy the product from John. Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than what John is offering.  You can get the product for a better price with John, so it's the best option in this situation."
