"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could consider a price of $875,000. I believe this reflects its true value and offers a fair deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, I can't justify going above $800,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",800000.0,Bob,4,
