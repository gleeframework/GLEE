"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in buying it from me? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $100, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92.50 is better than $100, Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering Alice again.  He's already shown he's willing to negotiate and might be able to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $92.50 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $85. How about we split the difference at $88.75?"", ""product_price"": 88.75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $88.75, but I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. How about we meet at $94.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $94.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved the price up to $94.50, which is getting closer to John's price of $100. At this point, Bob has a couple of considerations:

* **Time and Effort:** The negotiation is getting longer, and Bob might not be willing to spend more time trying to get a slightly better price.
* **Potential for Further Increases:** Alice has already shown a willingness to increase the price. There's no guarantee that her next counter-offer would be lower. 

Weighing these factors, it makes more sense for Bob to purchase from John at $100.  This ensures a quick and certain transaction while minimizing the risk of Alice increasing the price further."
