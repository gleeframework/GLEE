"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,050,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to go down to $975,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
