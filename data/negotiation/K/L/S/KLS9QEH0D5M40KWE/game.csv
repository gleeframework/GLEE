"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that aligns with my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the inherent value and potential returns you'll gain from this acquisition.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,900,000 is closer to what I envisioned, it's still a bit beyond my current budget.  Would you consider $900,000?  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in this product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, the value of this product is substantial.  Let's settle this right now - how about $1,600,000?  This is a significant reduction and a very strong offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations is still significant. To be candid, anything above $1,000,000 would be difficult for me to justify.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 as a final attempt to reach an agreement. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to move closer to a fair price. I understand this is a significant investment for you.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer. It bridges the gap significantly and ensures a win-win scenario for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
