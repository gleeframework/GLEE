"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm open to negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to see this deal through with you.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $2,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually agreeable price. I propose a counteroffer of $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm getting close to my limit.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
