Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm open to negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $2,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts.

We're getting closer, but I'm still willing to hold out for a better offer from Bob.  There's still a significant gap between his offer and John's guaranteed price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually agreeable price. I propose a counteroffer of $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm getting close to my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

}

Bob is now very close to my fallback offer from John. While I could push for more, there's a risk he'll walk away.  Accepting $1,550,000 secures a good profit and avoids potentially missing out entirely."
