"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $10,000.  I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and it's the best I can do.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I could keep negotiating, I'm concerned about the potential for further price reductions and the risk of running out of rounds. I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000 to ensure I get my minimum price."
