"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this moment. I'd be happy to purchase the product for $8500. Let me know if you're open to that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $8500 is below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $9000, which I believe is fair considering the value this product offers. This price still allows for a significant return on your investment. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $8750 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's try to meet in the middle.",8750.0,Bob,4,
