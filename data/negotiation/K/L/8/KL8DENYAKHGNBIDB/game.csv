"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1700000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1500000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1700000 and $1500000. How about $1600000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1450000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a profit.
