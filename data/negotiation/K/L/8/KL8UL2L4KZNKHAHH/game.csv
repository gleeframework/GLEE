"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm confident the product is worth more than $950,000, I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm offering a price of $1,050,000.  This price takes into account your needs and still allows for a reasonable profit for me. I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement in the next few rounds.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and the compromise you've shown. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,050,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
