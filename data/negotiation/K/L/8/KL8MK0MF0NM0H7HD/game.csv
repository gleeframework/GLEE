"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its potential value. To move this forward, I could meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This reflects my best offer considering its true worth.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
