"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am unable to meet the price of $1,050,000. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this time.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll lower my price to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
