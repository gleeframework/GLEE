"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This price gives you a significant advantage and allows me to maximize the value of my product.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
