"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to come to an agreement.  I'm not willing to go lower than $109. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I'm losing money at this price. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100",108.0,Bob,6,
