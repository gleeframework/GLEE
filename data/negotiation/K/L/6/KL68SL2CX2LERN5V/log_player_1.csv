Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It's also above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, giving him incentive to negotiate. 

Here's my strategy:

* **Start high, but be realistic:**  I want to maximize my profits, but I need to consider Bob's potential counteroffers and the risk of losing him entirely.
* **Leave room for compromise:** This initial offer allows for potential negotiation and compromise, giving Bob a sense of value in the deal. 
* **Keep John in mind:** The offer is still above John's offer, so I'm not risking losing him as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly less than what I want to earn. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for a higher offer:** Bob clearly sees value in the product, and his offer demonstrates his willingness to pay more than his initial perceived value of $800,000. This suggests there's still room for negotiation.
* **No immediate pressure:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer right away.
* **Maintaining bargaining power:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my bargaining power and can potentially push for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising the price slightly to $1,100,000. Here's my thinking:

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $1,000,000.
* **Showing flexibility:** It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Still above my minimum:** The price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it gives Bob a better chance of reaching a deal that is within his budget.

I believe this counteroffer balances the need to maximize my profit with the desire to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While there's still room for negotiation, I'm concerned that further back-and-forth might risk losing Bob completely and leaving me with no other option than to accept his next (potentially lower) offer. 

Given that John is willing to buy the product for $1,500,000, it's the safest and most profitable option to sell the product to him now. This guarantees a much better outcome for me compared to any further negotiation with Bob."
