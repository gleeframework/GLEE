Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for some potential negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust the price depending on his counteroffer.  However, I'll be ready to walk away and sell to John for $150 if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. While I am willing to negotiate, $120 is significantly below my minimum threshold. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while acknowledging Bob's interest in the product. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum threshold, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price. It's better to accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a prolonged process that could result in selling to John for a lower price."
