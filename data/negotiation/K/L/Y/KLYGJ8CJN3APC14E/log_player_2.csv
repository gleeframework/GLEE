"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, which is a better deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the door open for a better counter-offer or can proceed with your guaranteed purchase from John."
