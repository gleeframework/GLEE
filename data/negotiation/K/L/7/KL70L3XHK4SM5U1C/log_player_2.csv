# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1000000.  This reflects the product's inherent worth while leaving room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900000 is closer, it still falls short of what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $950000. This allows for a fair profit for both of us and ensures a successful deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal for you. It's significantly lower than buying from John, and you've already saved $50,000 from your initial counteroffer."
