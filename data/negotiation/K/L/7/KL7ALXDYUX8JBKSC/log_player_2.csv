"Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $7,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A $500 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer.  This shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also signals that he is willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,200, which is only $200 more than Bob's counteroffer.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be time-consuming and may not result in a significantly lower price.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees Bob gets the product for a price lower than John's, saving him $800."
