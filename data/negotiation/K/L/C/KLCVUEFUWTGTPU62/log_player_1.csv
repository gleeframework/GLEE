{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $12,000 is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further but I won't accept anything below my minimum value of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}

I'm lowering my price slightly to $16,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that John is a reliable buyer who's willing to pay my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm making a final attempt to get a higher price from Bob. This is a slight concession, but it's still above my minimum.  If he rejects this offer, I'll likely go with John."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and his offer is still below my minimum. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the best decision for me at this point."
