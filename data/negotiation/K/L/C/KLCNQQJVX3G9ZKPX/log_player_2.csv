"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
This is a no-brainer. Alice's offer is too high. It leaves little room for negotiation and you can always buy from John for $1,000,000.  It's time to make a counteroffer significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we bring it down significantly?"",
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Start:**  A low starting offer of $500,000 gives us significant room to negotiate upwards while staying well below John's $1,000,000 backup plan. 
* **Gauge Alice's Position:** This aggressive counteroffer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. 
* **Psychology:** By expressing that we need a price that ""makes sense for both of us,"" we subtly emphasize fairness and collaboration."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $500,000 is a significant reduction from the original offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $700,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice reducing her offer to $700,000 shows she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:** $700,000 is still significantly above her $800,000 valuation. There's space for us to negotiate a better deal.
* **Alternative Exists:** We have the safety net of John's offer at $1,000,000.

Let's continue to negotiate and try to get Alice closer to $600,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $700,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair and reasonable price."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're holding our ground at $600,000, which is a significant jump from our initial offer.
* **Direct Communication:**  Clearly stating our target price avoids ambiguity and encourages a faster negotiation.
* **Justification:**  While we don't need to over-explain, framing the offer as ""fair and reasonable"" maintains a collaborative tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm thinking of a price of $680,000. This is a sweet spot for me, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $680,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice is negotiating in smaller increments, signaling we're getting closer to her limit.
* **Potential Upside:** While $680,000 isn't ideal, we might be able to push her down a little further with another counteroffer. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  We're still comfortably below John's $1,000,000 price, so we have some room to maneuver. 

Let's try one more time to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. To meet you halfway, I can offer $640,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 640000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** We're proposing a price directly in the middle of our last offer ($600,000) and her current offer ($680,000).  
* **Finality:** By positioning this as a compromise to ""meet halfway,"" we're subtly implying this is our best offer.
* **Limited Risk:** We're still well within our budget and have a safety net with John's offer.

This counteroffer puts the ball in Alice's court and gives her a final chance to accept a price that works for both of us."
