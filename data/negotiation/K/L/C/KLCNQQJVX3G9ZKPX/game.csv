"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we bring it down significantly?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $500,000 is a significant reduction from the original offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $700,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $700,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair and reasonable price.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm thinking of a price of $680,000. This is a sweet spot for me, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",680000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. To meet you halfway, I can offer $640,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise for both of us.",640000.0,Bob,6,
