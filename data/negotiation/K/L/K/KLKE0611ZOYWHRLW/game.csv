"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1100000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $950000 is a good starting point,  I'm still committed to securing a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given our shared understanding of the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $990000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and show my commitment to the product. Can you consider this revised offer?",990000.0,Bob,4,
