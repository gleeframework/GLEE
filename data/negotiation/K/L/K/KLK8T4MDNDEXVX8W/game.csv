"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit while still staying within my budget.  What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price that still gives me a decent profit, and I think it's a good compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a good profit, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, giving you a fair margin while staying within my price range.  What do you say?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",15200.0,Alice,5,
