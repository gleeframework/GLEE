"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a little less. How about $750000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $800000. I'll make one more counteroffer, at $825000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. If you're not comfortable with this, I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
