Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $16,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."",
""product_price"": 16000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you can afford to start high.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Firm stance:** By stating it's a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" offer, you create a sense of urgency and potentially discourage haggling. 
* **Profit maximization:**  While Bob values the product at $12,000, he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it immediately. This offer aims to capture that potential premium.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject this offer outright. However, the strategy here is to maximize potential profit, knowing you have a safety net with John's offer."
