Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know you value it highly, and I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to a slightly higher sale price. 
* **Secure a Deal:**  There's a risk Bob might reject an offer that's too high. This price point significantly increases the chances of him accepting, ensuring a good profit and avoiding the need to sell to John at a lower price."
