"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $150 for it.  What do you think?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I think it's a fair price for this high-quality product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $150. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it now.",150.0,Bob,4,
