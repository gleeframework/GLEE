"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still within your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  You can see if you can push Alice down further towards your ideal price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $11,500. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a fair price. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and you ultimately having to buy from John for $15,000 is too high.  Accepting Alice's offer allows you to save $3,500 compared to John's price, which is a significant saving."
