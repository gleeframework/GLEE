Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price downwards slightly or consider selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $10,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than my minimum price of $8,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and trying to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500,  which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
