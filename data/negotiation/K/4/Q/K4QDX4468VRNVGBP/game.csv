"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth significantly more to you. Let's get this deal done.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is still below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which is still a great value for you.  Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest, $950,000 is still stretching my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That would work well for me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $900,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? It's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really driving a hard bargain! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $910,000.  I believe that's a fair compromise and shows I'm serious about buying. Let me know what you think.",910000.0,Bob,6,
