"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to spend closer to $80. Would you be willing to go lower?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend closer to 80, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try 100?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That would be a good compromise for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as 90. I'm willing to take a small step closer, though. How about we try 105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you getting closer, but 105 is still a bit too high. Let's try 95. It's closer to your offer and still within my budget.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as 95. I'm willing to take another small step closer, though. How about we try 110?",110.0,Alice,7,
