"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I can't go down to $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500.  This still leaves some room for me to profit, and hopefully, it's a fair price for you too.",10500.0,Alice,3,
