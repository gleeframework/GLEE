"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  I believe this offer makes it a great deal for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm still pretty far off from that price point.  To make this work, I can't go any higher than $9,500. Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit too high for me. I could maybe stretch my budget to $11,000.  That's a very generous offer considering John is offering me the same product for less.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,6,
