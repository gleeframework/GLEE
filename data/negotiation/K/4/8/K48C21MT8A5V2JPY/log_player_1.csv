Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit too high for me. I could maybe stretch my budget to $11,000.  That's a very generous offer considering John is offering me the same product for less.  What do you say?

**Reasoning:**

Bob is bluffing. He mentioned John is offering him the same product for less, which contradicts the information given that John is willing to buy from *you* for $15,000.  It's highly unlikely Bob has a better offer elsewhere. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks leaving you with a worse outcome.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees you the best possible price."
