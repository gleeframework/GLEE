"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and I'm confident I can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $10,000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle and I'll take $10,500.  This would be a great deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $10,250 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a slightly higher price with a few more rounds of negotiation. I have 6 rounds remaining, and I'm still confident in my ability to secure a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $10,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $10,400.  This price is fair, considering the value you place on the product and my need to cover my costs. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $10,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $10,200. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and this is getting close to my desired price. Accepting Bob's offer for $10,200 is a good deal, as it is significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. I have 4 rounds remaining, but I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
