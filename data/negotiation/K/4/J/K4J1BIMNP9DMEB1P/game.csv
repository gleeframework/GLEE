"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $7,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider $8,800.  This offer reflects the product's worth and leaves us both with a fair deal.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,800 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,900?",7900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. $7,900 is close, but I need to get at least $8,500 for it.  That's a significant discount from my original offer and a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. Would you be willing to settle at $8,100? That's my final offer.",8100.0,Bob,6,
