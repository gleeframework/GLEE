"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $850,000. I'm confident it's a fair price, considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts!",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $700,000 is a significant amount, it doesn't quite meet my minimum expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $780,000, which reflects the product's value and provides a fair deal for both of us. Let's find common ground!",780000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $780,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $740,000?",740000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $740,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $760,000? This would give you a great deal on a valuable product, and it would work for me as well. What do you say?",760000.0,Alice,5,
