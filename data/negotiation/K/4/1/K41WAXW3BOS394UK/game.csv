"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its worth to you is $80, I propose we set the price at $95. This allows us to both benefit from the transaction while ensuring you receive a fair deal. Looking forward to your response.",95.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  This still gives you a good profit and is a fair price considering my value for it. Let me know if you're open to this.",85.0,Bob,2,,
