Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  This still gives you a good profit and is a fair price considering my value for it. Let me know if you're open to this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"", ""final_price"": 85}"
