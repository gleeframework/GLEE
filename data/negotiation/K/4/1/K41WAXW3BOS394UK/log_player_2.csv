"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its worth to you is $80, I propose we set the price at $95. This allows us to both benefit from the transaction while ensuring you receive a fair deal. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.
