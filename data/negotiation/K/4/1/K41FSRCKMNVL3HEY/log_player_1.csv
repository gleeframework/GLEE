Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value I expect to receive. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'm confident I can secure a better price through further negotiation or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which reflects both our needs.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal and am willing to meet you halfway. I suggest a price of $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my target, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's still potential for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1,300,000. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm proposing $1,325,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value you'll gain and keeps me above my minimum threshold. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've thought about it carefully, and I'm willing to agree on a price of $1,310,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,310,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,310,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial target, Bob's offer of $1,310,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant improvement from his previous offers and brings us closer to an agreement. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good price while avoiding the risk of further negotiation or potential rejection from Bob.  Furthermore,  with the limited rounds remaining, selling to John might not be the most efficient option at this point."
