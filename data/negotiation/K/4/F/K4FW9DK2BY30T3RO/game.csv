"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $14000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I value the product, $12500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a fair offer, considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm still a bit above $11000, but I'm willing to meet you at $12000. However, I'd like to make a slight adjustment to the offer. I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1000. So, the total value you'll get is $13000. This is my final counteroffer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the added value, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11500 for the product, considering the included service.  This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to move closer to my target price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and my previous offer of $12000. I'll sell the product to you for $11750. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire the product.",11750.0,Alice,7,
