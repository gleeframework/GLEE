(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with her before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice, as there's still room for a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I value the product, $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair offer, considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm still a bit above $11000, but I'm willing to meet you at $12000. However, I'd like to make a slight adjustment to the offer. I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1000. So, the total value you'll get is $13000. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a complimentary service, the total value still exceeds my budget. I'm hesitant to accept the deal as I can still try to negotiate further. I'm not sure if the service is genuinely worth $1000, and I'd prefer to stick to my maximum budget.  I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the added value, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500 for the product, considering the included service.  This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to move closer to my target price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and my previous offer of $12000. I'll sell the product to you for $11750. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While I could continue negotiating, we're nearing the end of our rounds, and I'm concerned about the potential for a stalemate. It's better to secure the product at my budget limit with John than risk getting stuck at a higher price with Alice."
