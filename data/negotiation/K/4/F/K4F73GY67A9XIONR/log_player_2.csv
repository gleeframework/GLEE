"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I believe it's a fantastic deal, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $180. This is way above Bob's maximum price.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is too low for me. Could you do $160?

While $160 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still above his target. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can get a lower price."
