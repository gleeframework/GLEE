"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it could be incredibly valuable to your work.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my proposal, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am currently working within a tighter budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,050,000? I believe this would better align with my current financial situation.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $1,100,000. I am still hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
