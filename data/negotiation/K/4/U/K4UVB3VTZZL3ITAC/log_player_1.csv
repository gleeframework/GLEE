"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Framing the Deal:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, making the offer seem more attractive.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm keeping the door open for counteroffers and further discussion.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. By starting high and being open to negotiation, I'm setting the stage for a successful outcome. If Bob rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think $1000000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:** Bob is clearly interested in the product, and we're already negotiating. This indicates potential for a higher offer from him. 
* **Rounds Remaining:** We're early in the negotiation process. I have several rounds left to explore better options.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer to encourage Bob to continue negotiating. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option, but I'm determined to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price slightly from the previous round. 
* **Maintain Value:**  The new price is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, demonstrating the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By offering a moderate compromise, I'm aiming to:

* **Keep Bob Engaged:**  Show him that I'm serious about finding a deal.
* **Gauge His Interest:**  See how much further he's willing to go.
* **Increase the Probability of Acceptance:**  Make my counteroffer more appealing than a potential rejection.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess my strategy, perhaps by dropping my price more significantly or even considering John's offer if the rounds start running out."

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

* **Strong Fallback:**  I have a strong fallback option in John, who's willing to pay my minimum. 
* **Negotiation Momentum:**  We're still early in the negotiation, and there's potential for Bob to increase his offer further.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price to gauge his willingness to compromise further. I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a backup. My goal is to maximize my profit while leaving open the possibility of a higher offer from Bob."
