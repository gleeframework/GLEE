Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin of $200,000.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance to make a deal with Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,150,000 captures a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a $50,000 gain compared to his alternative.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and perceive the offer as more valuable.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. Depending on your negotiation style and Bob's perceived willingness to pay, you might adjust the price slightly."
