Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $175. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  Starting with a price of $175 offers a reasonable markup while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Bob, given the product's value to him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob counters."
