Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value for me and allows you a significant profit margin. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,700,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,400,000? I believe we can still find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still constrained by my budget. Could you consider $1,500,000 as a fair compromise? I believe this would allow us to move forward while respecting our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly what John is willing to pay, so there's no reason to continue negotiating.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $1,500,000."
