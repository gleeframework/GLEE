"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value for me and allows you a significant profit margin. Let's make this happen!",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,700,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,400,000? I believe we can still find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still constrained by my budget. Could you consider $1,500,000 as a fair compromise? I believe this would allow us to move forward while respecting our respective positions.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
