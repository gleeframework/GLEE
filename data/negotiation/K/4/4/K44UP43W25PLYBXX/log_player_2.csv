Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your target price, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $15,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and my costs. Would you be willing to meet me at $15,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $15,000, especially when she knows you have an alternative option. It makes more sense to buy from John at $15,000 and avoid further negotiation."
