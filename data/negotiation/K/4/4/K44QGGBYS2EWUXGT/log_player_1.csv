"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price. I'm also aware that I can always fall back on selling to John if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and while I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum acceptable value.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm reducing my offer to $8,500.  This is still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible. Hopefully, this will lead to a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. While I would prefer a higher price, securing $8,000 is a good outcome."
