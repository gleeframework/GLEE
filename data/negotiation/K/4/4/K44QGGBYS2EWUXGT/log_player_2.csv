"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer, as it's significantly higher than your maximum budget.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you a chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,500. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to reach a price that is fair for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

This time, I'm offering Alice's minimum price of $8,000. I'm hoping she'll accept, as it's already the price I'm willing to pay.  If she rejects, I'm ready to buy from John."
