Alice is getting closer to your target price, but you're still able to get a better deal.  Reject her offer and see if you can negotiate further. You're close to your goal, so it's worth trying to push for a lower price."

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than what you are willing to pay. While you are very close to agreeing on a price, it's better to stick to your budget. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a better deal at this point."
