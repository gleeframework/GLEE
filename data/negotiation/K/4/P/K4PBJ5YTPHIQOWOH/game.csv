"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. To move forward, I could consider a price of $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,700,000. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects the product's true value.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
