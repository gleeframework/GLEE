Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is too low. Let's see if we can negotiate a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. To move forward, I could consider a price of $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  However,  $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,700,000. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are getting closer. I can do $1,200,000. This is my final offer.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough one. Bob is at his maximum price, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome. While I'd prefer a higher price, getting $1,200,000 is better than risking a complete breakdown in the negotiation and getting stuck with John's offer.
