"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $18000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $16000 is still a little outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $15500. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's close the deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $16200, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",16200.0,Alice,5,
