Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This is a starting point above Bob's perceived value of $100. It's also below my minimum value of $150, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and persuasive, highlighting the value of the product while not revealing my desperation to sell. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize profits:** I aim to get as close to my minimum value of $150 as possible, while still keeping Bob interested in the negotiation.
* **Keep options open:** By mentioning John's offer, I show Bob that I have other potential buyers, adding urgency to his decision.
* **Be prepared to counter:** I am ready to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial offer. I will carefully consider his counteroffer and make a counter-counteroffer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum value of $150 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $100.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it demonstrates his interest in the product. There's still potential for a mutually agreeable price through further negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and set a more reasonable counteroffer in the next round.  

**Next Steps:** 

I will prepare a counteroffer that is more realistic, but still above my minimum value of $150.  I'll try to find a price that is attractive to Bob while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  While I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I'm also demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  The counteroffer of $125 is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Appeal to fairness:** I'm framing $125 as a fair price based on the product's value. This appeals to Bob's sense of reason and may encourage him to reconsider.
* **Maintain my minimum:**  The counteroffer is still above my minimum value of $150, ensuring I don't lose money on the sale.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging, focusing on finding an agreeable solution.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between flexibility and maintaining my own financial interests. By offering a more reasonable price, I'm hoping to keep the negotiation moving forward and potentially secure a sale closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a little ways off.  How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $95 is an improvement over his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. Accepting it would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  At this point, further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price that meets my minimum requirement.  His offers are consistently below my acceptable range.
* **Securing a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John at $150 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which may lead to even lower offers or a complete stalemate.

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I prioritize maximizing my profit and minimizing risk. While further negotiation with Bob is a possibility, it's unlikely to lead to a better outcome.  It's more efficient and profitable to secure the sale with John at this point."
