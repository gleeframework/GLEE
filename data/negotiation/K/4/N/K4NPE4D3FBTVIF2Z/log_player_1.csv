Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, there's no incentive to go lower.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Psychology:** Offering a price slightly below my ""guaranteed"" sale might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal and could encourage him to accept."
