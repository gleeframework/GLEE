"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm Alice. I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is quite low, and there's a good chance we can negotiate a better price. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept. Could you consider something closer to $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is slowly coming up in price, but we're still not close enough to my minimum. I'll counter-offer, but I'm also keeping John in mind if the negotiation drags. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're getting closer!  I can tell you're serious about this.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That's a very fair offer."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $11,500 is still a bit steep for me though.  Would you be willing to do it for $10,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is a tough one! Bob is at his maximum price, and it's unlikely he'll go higher.  While I could push for a bit more, it's risky. 

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's a shame to leave some money on the table, but a sure $12,000 from John is better than potentially ending up with less if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
