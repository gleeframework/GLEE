"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,800,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It's in your best interest to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable price. Would you consider $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $1,000,000 is a significant jump down, it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** This leaves ample room for negotiation to reach a price agreeable to both parties, hopefully somewhere closer to your target price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will give you a better sense of Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above your maximum budget and what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $1,400,000 is better, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle somewhere around $1,150,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  You are increasing your offer, but not dramatically. This shows willingness to move while still aiming for significant savings.
* **Targeting a Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims for a price point closer to the middle of the remaining gap between your last offer and her current one.
* **Deadline Pressure:**  While not explicitly stated, you are getting closer to John's price, subtly implying you have other options if a deal can't be reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $1,150,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down further, but she's still $100,000 above John's offer. She has also signaled this is her ""best and final"" offer. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better price from Alice.  It's now more advantageous to secure the product at John's price of $1,200,000."
