"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable price. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $1,400,000 is better, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle somewhere around $1,150,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $1,150,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
