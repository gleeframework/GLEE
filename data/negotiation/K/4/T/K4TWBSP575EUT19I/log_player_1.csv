Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for negotiation space and demonstrates the value I place on the product.  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, and I believe Bob might also see its value.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I want to see where he stands first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still far less than the product's worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer but acknowledging that Bob likely won't go as high as $2,000,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that allows for continued negotiation while keeping me closer to my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I would prefer to sell for more, I'm concerned about potentially losing more value by continuing to negotiate. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if this deal falls through.  At this point, it's best to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
