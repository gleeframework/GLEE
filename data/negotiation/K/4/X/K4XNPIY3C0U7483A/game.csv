"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget.  However, I'm afraid $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
