Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

It's important to me that I get a fair price for this product, which is worth significantly more than that. How about we compromise at $14,500? This would be a good midpoint, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.
