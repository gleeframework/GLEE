"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm open to further negotiation, but I can't go lower than $15,500. This price reflects the product's true value and is still a competitive offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $15,500. Would you be willing to consider $13,750?",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,750. It's important to me that I get a fair price for this product, which is worth significantly more than that. How about we compromise at $14,500? This would be a good midpoint, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,500. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,6,
