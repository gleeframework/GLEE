"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $900,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a good offer, I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close this transaction.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finally close this transaction. What do you think?",940000.0,Alice,5,
