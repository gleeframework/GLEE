"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $1250000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1275000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value to you.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
