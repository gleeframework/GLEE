"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product at my minimum acceptable price. This way, I set the bar high and give myself room to negotiate if needed. If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back on John's offer to secure my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll counter with a price that is closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $950,000 is still too low.  I'm going to keep negotiating with him, hoping to get a better price.  There's still time and I don't want to lose out on a higher offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is another compromise, as it's lower than my previous offer but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to come up a bit more on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, though it's getting closer.  I'm going to keep negotiating. There's a possibility that Bob will be willing to go higher, and I don't want to miss out on a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

We're getting close! I'm going to counter with $1,025,000. This is a smaller concession this time, hoping to signal that I'm getting close to my limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I'm going to sell to John to ensure I get my minimum price.  While I'd like to have negotiated a higher price with Bob, the risk of not closing the deal with him outweighs the possibility of getting a slightly better price."
