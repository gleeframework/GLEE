"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth that much to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, there is no benefit in accepting her offer. You can get the product from John for the same price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you maintain the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or exploring other options."
