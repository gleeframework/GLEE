Here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 12,000}

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's counteroffer is a bit lower than I expected!

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I think I can get a better price from Bob.
