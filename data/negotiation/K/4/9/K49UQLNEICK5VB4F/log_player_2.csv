"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering.  There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in this product but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? That's the absolute most I can afford at the moment."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's still higher than his ideal price of $8,000. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but also gives him room to negotiate further. He also provides a reason for his price to make it more persuasive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's a significant reduction from my initial offer and a great deal considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his ideal.  Bob can likely continue to negotiate and get a better deal. He still has 7 rounds left and can always purchase from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down.  $9,500 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500. This product is definitely important to me, but I'm trying to be realistic about what I can afford."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer, showing that he's firm on his budget. He reiterates his interest in the product to keep the negotiation open and avoid losing a potential deal. This keeps the pressure on Alice to make further concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. I'm really trying to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? That's a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. He has 5 rounds left, and John is always a viable option. Bob should continue to negotiate in hopes of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair compromise, and it would make this purchase possible for me."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small counteroffer, showing he's willing to budge a little. This keeps the negotiation moving while still staying close to his ideal price.  He's hoping Alice will accept this offer, as it's likely she'd rather sell than risk losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $8,750 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,875. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but this is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his target price with John.  He should continue to negotiate to try and get Alice down to his ideal price of $8,000.  He still has three rounds left, and John is a guaranteed option if the deal falls through. A counteroffer at this point keeps the pressure on Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  I'm really close to my budget with this offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a way to make it work. Would you consider $8,500? It's the absolute most I can afford, and it would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his limit. He's offering $8,500 which is a significant concession from Alice's final offer of $8,875. Bob is hoping Alice will accept this offer, seeing it as a good deal for both parties.  If Alice rejects, Bob can always buy from John, so he's in a strong position."
