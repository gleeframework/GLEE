While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,125,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  This price still yields a profit of $325,000 over my baseline ($1,125,000 - $800,000).
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and risks associated with continued negotiation. 
* **Bob's Commitment:** Bob has consistently shown interest and willingness to negotiate. Accepting now capitalizes on his commitment before he potentially changes his mind."
