"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your time and consideration. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the value I'm looking to get out of this product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I had in mind. The value this product brings to the table, particularly for someone like you, is substantial. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be open to considering $1,150,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my means.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect your commitment to finding the right deal.  Let's make this happen -  $1,175,000  and we have a deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,125,000? I'm willing to make a final compromise to get this deal done.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
