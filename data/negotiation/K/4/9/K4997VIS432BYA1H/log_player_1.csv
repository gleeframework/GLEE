"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and avoids immediately triggering a ""no deal"" scenario.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value Bob will gain by acquiring the product.
* **Positive Tone:**  I use a friendly and encouraging tone to set a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it at this point.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can still push for a higher price. 
* **Time to counteroffer:** Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and hopefully get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,400,000? That's still a great price considering the value you'll gain from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm bridging the gap between our initial offers.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm continuing to bridge the gap between our offers, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the product's value again, reminding Bob of the benefit he'll gain.
* **Setting a Deadline:** I'm subtly signaling that we're nearing the end of the negotiation process. 

**Strategy:**

With fewer rounds remaining, I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum while still being reasonably attractive to Bob. I need to find a balance between getting a good price and avoiding a stalemate that might lead me to sell to John."

* **Time Running Out:** With only four rounds remaining, I need to be strategic and try to push for a higher price.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a better price, especially with the pressure of time.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.

```

**Reasoning:**

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Critical:**  We're down to two rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  There's a high chance we'll reach a stalemate if I counteroffer again. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $1,500,000.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited time and the risk of not securing a deal, it's wiser to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed profit. The potential for a slightly higher price from Bob isn't worth the risk of losing the sale altogether."
