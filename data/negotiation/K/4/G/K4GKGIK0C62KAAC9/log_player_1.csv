Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a good deal for me and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will recognize the value of this product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still represents a good deal for him, considering he values the product at $800,000. I'm hoping this compromise will encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price of $1,200,000, Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to accept his offer and finalize the deal. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
