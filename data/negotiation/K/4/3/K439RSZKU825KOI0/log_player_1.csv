"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm interested in your product but can only offer $750000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $750,000 is too far below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This reflects the value I know this product holds, and I believe it's still a fair price for you. Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not ready to accept it. I have 6 rounds left with Bob, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but it's still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  How about $1,100,000? This would represent a good compromise and allow us to both walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're close, but $1100000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, my absolute limit. If this works for you, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I may have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered my minimum price of $1,000,000. While I would have liked to get more, I have 4 rounds remaining and don't want to risk losing this deal and having to settle for the same price with John."
