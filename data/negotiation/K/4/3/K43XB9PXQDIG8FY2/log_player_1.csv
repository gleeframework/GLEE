Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price. While I'm open to negotiation, I want to ensure I get what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is below my minimum price, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offers are still too low. At this point, it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'll take the guaranteed $120 from John."
