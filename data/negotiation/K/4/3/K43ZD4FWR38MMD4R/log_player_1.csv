Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your guaranteed price from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** This exists between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. Any price within this range can benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but not so high that Bob walks away.  Since you have a backup offer, you're in a strong position.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're confidently stating the product's value.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still netting you a significant profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties (even without explicitly naming John) creates a bit of pressure for Bob to act.

**Important Note:**  Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer.  Having a clear understanding of your walk-away point ($1,000,000) will help you make informed decisions during the negotiation."
