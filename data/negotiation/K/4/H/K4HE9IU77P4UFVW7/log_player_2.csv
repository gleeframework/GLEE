"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $9,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a better price, especially since I have time and the option to buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product looks great, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's opening offer to leave room for negotiation and understand her bottom line. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is slightly above Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000), aiming for a price that's beneficial for me while still potentially acceptable to her. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind John's offer ($10,000) as a backup plan, giving me leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $7,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you do $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $8,750 is still closer to her initial offer than mine. I'll keep negotiating to see if I can get the price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need to stick within my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and to the point:** I'm cutting to the chase by proposing a price that's a win-win.
* **Meeting in the middle:** This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's favorable for me.
* **Pressure Point:** Offering her perceived value might be enough to close the deal. It also sets a firm boundary as I get closer to John's offer."
