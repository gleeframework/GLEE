"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a fair starting point, considering my minimum value is $120. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested but not willing to pay full price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's above my minimum value of $120, it's still lower than my initial offer, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I have nine rounds left and can still go to John as a backup if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $140. It's a compromise, closer to his offer but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this will encourage him to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  I've got 6 rounds left and could potentially get a better price, but I'm also concerned about time running out.  Selling to John guarantees me $120, but $135 is a better outcome."
