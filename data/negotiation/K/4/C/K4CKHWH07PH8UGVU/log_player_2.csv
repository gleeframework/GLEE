"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! It's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate.  Alice is clearly willing to go lower than $1,000,000, so there's room to make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'll try to get a better deal by making another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $912500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $912,500 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I believe there's still room to negotiate further. I'll try making one more counteroffer."

While I'd prefer to save more money, at this point, the negotiation has become a bit too drawn-out, and I'm not sure Alice will budge further.  I'd rather avoid further rounds of back-and-forth and get the product from John for $1,000,000. It's a sure thing, and while it's not the lowest price, it's within my budget."
