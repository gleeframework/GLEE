It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about we split the difference and go with $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I can meet you halfway between $90 and $95, so I'll offer it to you for $92.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's still possible to get a better price from Alice. I'll try a counteroffer closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $91 for the product.  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 91}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $92, which is just $0.50 above your last offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $100. Let's shake on it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $92 is just slightly above my counteroffer of $91, and it's still below the $100 I'd pay John. It's a good deal for me, so I'll accept it."
