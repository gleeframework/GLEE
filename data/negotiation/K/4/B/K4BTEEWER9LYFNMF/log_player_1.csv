Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we want to maximize our profit. Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($12,000) gives room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Leaving room for Bob to feel good about the deal:**  Offering a price of $11,000 allows Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit and feel like he's getting a bargain, even if it's still above his initial valuation.
* **Protecting your bottom line:** If Bob rejects this offer, you're not losing out since you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your desired minimum price."
