"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but only at the right price.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,800,000.  This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a firm budget in mind.  I'd be willing to go up to $900,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, but the price gap remains substantial. Let's try to bridge that.  How about $1,600,000? This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However,  $1,600,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
