"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you meet me a little higher at $1,025,000? This would still represent a significant saving compared to my initial asking price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Could you consider $1,012,500 for the product?",1012500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $1,012,500 is very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept that price, but only if you can finalize the deal within the next 24 hours.  Does that work for you?",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,012,500, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,005,000, but I need some flexibility on the timeline. Could you consider a 48-hour window instead of 24 hours?",1005000.0,Bob,6,
