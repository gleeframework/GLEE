"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your desired value. How about we settle at $1,175,000? That meets us closer to the middle ground while still being a good deal for me.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
