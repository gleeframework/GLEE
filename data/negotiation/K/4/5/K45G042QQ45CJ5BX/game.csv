"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1100000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1100000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm thinking $1075000 is a sweet spot. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
