"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is appealing, the value of this product to my business sits significantly higher.  I could consider letting it go for $1,650,000. This demonstrates my desire to strike a deal while ensuring a fair outcome for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your coming down in price, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the potential value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. This offer represents a fair compromise and keeps us both within our respective budgets. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
