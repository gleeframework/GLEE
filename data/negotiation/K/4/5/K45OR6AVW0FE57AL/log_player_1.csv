"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $950,000.  It's a significant value to you, and I believe this price reflects that.  Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  There are still many rounds left, so I have room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see at least $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is above my minimum threshold of $800,000, and we're already four rounds into the negotiation.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. There's a chance Bob could walk away, or I might run out of rounds and be forced to sell to John for less.  It's better to secure this offer and move on."
