"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great opportunity to own a valuable item worth more than its face value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $95. While it's a good deal, you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. How about we agree on a price of $90 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

You can still get the product for a lower price than $90. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating."
