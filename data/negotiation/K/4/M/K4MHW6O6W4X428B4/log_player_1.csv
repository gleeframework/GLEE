Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a good starting point:** It's a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, making it attractive to Bob.
* **The message is friendly and persuasive:**  It highlights the value of the product and encourages Bob to accept the offer. 
* **I'm keeping my options open:** I can always accept John's offer of $12,000 if Bob doesn't want to negotiate. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000 and even below what the product is worth to him. Accepting this offer would be a significant loss for me.
* **I'm still confident in my negotiation position:** I can still make a profit by selling to John for $12,000. 
* **I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise further:** By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range. 

Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $9,500? That would be a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering $9,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Highlight fairness:**  I emphasize that $9,500 is a ""fair price for both of us,"" which can be persuasive.

By sticking to my minimum value and demonstrating willingness to compromise, I'm hoping to get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** $9,000 is just $3,000 below my minimum of $12,000, and it's a good profit for me.
* **The negotiation is getting tiring:**  We've gone through a few rounds already, and I don't want to risk Bob backing out entirely.
* **Selling to John isn't a significant gain:** While $12,000 is better, it's not a huge jump from $9,000. 

It's time to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
