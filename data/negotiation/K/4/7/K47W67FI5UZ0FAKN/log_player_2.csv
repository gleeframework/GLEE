"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is less than Alice's value of $12,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price, it is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price or simply buy from John for $10,000."
