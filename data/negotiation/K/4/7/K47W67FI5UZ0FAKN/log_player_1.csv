Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $11,000 is higher than $10,000, giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still higher than your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you don't sell below your desired price.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** The offer allows for some back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price. 

Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000 if Bob proves too stubborn or if the negotiation drags on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know if you're willing to work with me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to accept an offer that's below my threshold. I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you.  I'm hoping we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **It's closer to your desired price:** It's above your minimum, but still gives some wiggle room for future negotiation.
* **It's a clear signal:** It shows Bob that you're serious about selling the product, but you're also not willing to give it away at a price significantly below your perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10250. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, his latest offer is still below my minimum threshold of $12,000.  This negotiation has gone on long enough, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price.  Rather than risk losing the deal entirely, I'm going to accept John's offer of $12,000.  It's a better deal for me, and it ensures I don't lose out on the potential value of the product."
