"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

Alice has come down to your maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting and potentially losing the deal, or buying from John at the same price."
