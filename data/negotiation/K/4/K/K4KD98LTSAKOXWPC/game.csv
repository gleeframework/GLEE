"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for a high-quality item that's worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $8,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking to get closer to your asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That's a significant increase from my initial offer.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,750 is still below my minimum. How about we settle on $8,250?  That's a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think!",8250.0,Alice,5,
