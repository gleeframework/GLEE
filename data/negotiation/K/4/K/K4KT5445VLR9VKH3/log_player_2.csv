"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's value ($10,000) as possible.  Offering $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and leaves some room for negotiation if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. While it's still a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Rejection allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating willingness to compromise while still staying below Alice's current offer. This approach could potentially persuade Alice to accept as it's closer to her ideal price than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price. While $13,000 is a good price, Bob still has some rounds left and can try to push for a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing a willingness to compromise. This offer is still below Alice's current price, and it's a good balance between getting a better deal and avoiding further rejections.  With only a few rounds left, it's important to make a strong counteroffer to potentially secure a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but there are still rounds left. Bob can continue negotiating for a better price.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a deal closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer one last time to show his commitment to a deal.  This offer is still lower than Alice's current price, but with only a few rounds remaining, it's a bold move to try and secure a deal closer to his ideal price.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob might be forced to accept her next offer or go with John, which would be less ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is getting dangerously close to Bob's maximum price of $15,000. With only one round remaining, there's a high chance Alice will increase her price further, or even reject Bob's next counteroffer. It's more beneficial for Bob to go with John, as he's guaranteed to get the product at his maximum price point.  This eliminates the risk of Alice increasing her price further, which could lead to a worse outcome for Bob."
