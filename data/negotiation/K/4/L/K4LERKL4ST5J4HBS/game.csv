"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This price is still below my initial offer, but it reflects the value I believe the product holds for you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000, but I'm also willing to meet you at $925,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
