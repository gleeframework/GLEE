"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm happy to offer you $8,500 for it.  This would still be a good profit for you, and it fits within my budget. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't accept $8,500.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this happen.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $8,875? This is my final offer.",8875.0,Alice,5,
