"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try to get a better price, and $9,500 is still above your desired price range.  We'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm happy to offer you $8,500 for it.  This would still be a good profit for you, and it fits within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't accept $8,500.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit high.  I'll try to get a lower price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $8,875? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $8,875 is still a bit more than my ideal, it's a good deal considering I only have a few rounds left, and going to John would cost me even more.  It's time to close this deal."
