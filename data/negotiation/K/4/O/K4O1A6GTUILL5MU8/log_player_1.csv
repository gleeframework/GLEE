Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Here's why I chose this offer:

* **Above your minimum:** $10,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000. This gives you room to negotiate.
* **Not too high:** It's not so high that it immediately scares Bob away. 
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage.

**Important:** This is just a starting point. Your strategy will depend on your assessment of Bob's interest and your willingness to take risks. Remember, you have a backup option with John, so you're not under immense pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to accept $7500?  I'm very interested in your product, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum desired price of $8,000.  Accepting would mean selling for less than you want. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation:** You're in a good position to negotiate.  Bob has expressed interest, showing you have leverage.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees you $8,000, but a counteroffer could potentially lead to a higher price.
* **Potential for compromise:** Bob is willing to negotiate. A counteroffer could lead to a deal that's mutually beneficial.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to carefully craft a counteroffer that is:

* **Higher than $7,500:** Aim for something closer to your desired price point.
* **Still within a reasonable range:** Don't price yourself out of the deal.
* **Convincing:**  Explain your reasoning and demonstrate why your counteroffer is fair."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $7,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $8,500.  This gives you a significant discount from my original offer and ensures I get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate, while still staying above your minimum.
* **Fairness:**  The offer is a middle ground, offering a discount from your initial price, but still giving you a good return.
* **Clear reasoning:**  The message explains your thinking, making it easier for Bob to understand your position.

**Key considerations:**

* **Bob's likely response:**  Will Bob accept or counteroffer? This will influence your next move.
* **Your willingness to compromise:** How much are you willing to lower your price to secure a deal with Bob? 
* **Risk assessment:** Do you want to risk potentially losing Bob as a buyer, or is it worth taking a chance?"
