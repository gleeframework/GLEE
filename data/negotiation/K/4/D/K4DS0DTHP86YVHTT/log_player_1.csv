Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value it brings to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:**  $950,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Below Bob's perceived value:** $950,000 is still lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,000,000), giving him an incentive to accept.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially increase the price if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $800,000 at any point if you feel the negotiations with Bob aren't going well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below your desired price point. You can likely push for a higher price. 

By rejecting his offer, you'll be able to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable deal. This approach allows you to try and maximize your earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $900,000 for the product. This would still leave you with a significant value gain and would allow me to achieve a more profitable outcome. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
