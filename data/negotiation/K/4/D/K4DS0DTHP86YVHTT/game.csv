"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $900,000 for the product. This would still leave you with a significant value gain and would allow me to achieve a more profitable outcome. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
