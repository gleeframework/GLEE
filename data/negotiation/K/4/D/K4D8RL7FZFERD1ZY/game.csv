"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget considerations, but $14,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $16,500?",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for us both. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $16,500 is still too low for me. How about $18,000? This is my final offer.",18000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $17,000, but that's as low as I can go.",17000.0,Bob,6,
