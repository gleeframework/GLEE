Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives it as valuable. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high allows room for negotiation. If Bob counters, there's space to come down while still staying above John's offer.
* **Confidence:**  A confident opening offer can sometimes sway a buyer, especially if they are unsure of the product's exact market value. 

**Important:** While John's offer provides a safety net, it's essential to remember that aiming too high could make Bob walk away. Finding the right balance between ambition and realism is key to a successful negotiation."
