"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm looking to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,500,000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise, considering the value you're getting from the sale.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product.
