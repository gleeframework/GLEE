"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $130. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll sell it to you for $160. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you'll consider it.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $145? This is my final offer, as I'm ready to move on if this doesn't work out.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll sell it to you for $155. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you'll consider it.",155.0,Alice,5,
