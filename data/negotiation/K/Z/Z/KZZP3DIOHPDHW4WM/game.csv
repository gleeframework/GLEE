"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,450,000, considering my budget is $1,500,000",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is truly significant, and $1,450,000 is a fair reflection of that.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000.  I believe this is a very competitive offer considering the potential return on investment you'll see.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,350,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting close. I value your interest and want to make this work. How about we settle at $1,375,000?  It's a strong offer that reflects the value you'll gain.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than $1,375,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle",1325000.0,Bob,6,
