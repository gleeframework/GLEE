"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120. It's not a good deal for you. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $90 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You are still trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is closer to your target, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $105. I'm willing to make one more offer to you. I'll sell it to you for $115. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is $115, which is still above your target price of $100. You have 5 rounds left, but there's no guarantee that Alice will budge any further. It's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $100."
