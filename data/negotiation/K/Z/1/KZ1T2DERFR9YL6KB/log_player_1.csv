"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $14,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is below the product's true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still being a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not able to meet the $12,000 price point. Considering my budget, I would like to propose an offer of $9,500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $10,000.  I can secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John and avoid further negotiation."
