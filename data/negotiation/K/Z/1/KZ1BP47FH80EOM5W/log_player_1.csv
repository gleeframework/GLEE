{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum desired price but still leaves room for negotiation. By offering a lower price, I incentivize Bob to accept the deal.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but $7,500 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price.  I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Bob or potentially sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  It's a good compromise and  I'm comfortable with this price, especially since it avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection, and the risk of losing out on a sale altogether.  I can always make up the difference with another sale."
