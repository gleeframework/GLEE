"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
