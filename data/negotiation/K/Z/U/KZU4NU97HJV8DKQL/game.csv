"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $13,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is my final offer.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell it to you for $12,800. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,800 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $11,500. This is my final offer, and if you can't do that, I'm going to have to go with another seller.",11500.0,Bob,6,
