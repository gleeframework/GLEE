Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $700,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000.

This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 675000}"
