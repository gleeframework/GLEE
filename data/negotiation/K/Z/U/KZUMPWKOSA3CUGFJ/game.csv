"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $700,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value and your potential benefits, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $675,000. This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",675000.0,Alice,3,
