"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint that I need to work within. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This allows us both to find a good deal while still being fair.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. Would you be willing to come down to $1,250,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
