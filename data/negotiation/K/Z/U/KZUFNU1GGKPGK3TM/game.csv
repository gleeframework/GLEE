"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a great deal to me, and I believe it could be extremely valuable for your business as well. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return on it. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good fit for my business. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $1000000 is certainly a significant sum, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still allows me to recover a reasonable amount, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1250000 is still a little above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but I need to stay within that range. Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
