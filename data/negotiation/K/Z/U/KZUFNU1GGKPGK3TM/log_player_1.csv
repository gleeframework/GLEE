Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good fit for my business. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's fair for both of us. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $1,000,000 is certainly a significant sum, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to recover a reasonable amount, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1250000 is still a little above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but I need to stay within that range. Let's find a way to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired value for the product.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're close to an agreement. To demonstrate my willingness to meet you halfway, I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,137,500.

Let's see if we can find a final resolution."", ""product_price"": 1137500}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price within my initial budget. I'm willing to go up to $1130000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap in this final round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still slightly below my ideal price, it's very close and I'm running out of negotiation rounds.  It's better to close the deal with Bob now for $1,130,000 rather than risk getting a lower offer or having to sell to John for only $1,000,000."
