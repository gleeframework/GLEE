# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less.  How about $10,000?  This would still be a great deal for you and would allow me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I need to make a slightly higher offer to ensure my profit margins. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11800. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,800. Bob has made a counteroffer of $11,000.  This offer is a compromise, but it's getting close to Bob's budget. While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's a good deal, and the risk of further negotiation could lead to Alice rejecting further counteroffers, forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price."
