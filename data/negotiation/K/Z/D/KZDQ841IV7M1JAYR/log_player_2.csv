"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our premium product, which I believe has the potential to revolutionize your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price, considering its value and the benefits it can bring to your organization. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum price of $1,200,000.  There's potential for a better deal, so I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be willing to offer $750,000 for the product, considering my budget and the need for further evaluation. "", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  I'm making a substantial counteroffer, dropping the price by $200,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal and encourages her to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, focusing on my budget and need to further assess the product's value. This helps frame the negotiation and shows I'm not just throwing out a random number. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  While $750,000 is a significant drop, it still leaves room for Alice to counter with a price that could be acceptable for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product can bring significant value to your business. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850000. This is a compromise that I believe is still fair, given the product's value and potential benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Alice's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to push for a lower price.
* **Avoiding Impulsive Decisions:**  While $850,000 is a decent price, I'm not in a rush to buy. By rejecting the offer, I can continue to explore the possibility of a better deal.
* **Assessing the Product's True Value:** Each round of negotiation gives me more information about the product's value to Alice, which helps me determine how low I can push the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. Based on my initial assessment, I'd be willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This would require me to make some adjustments to my budget, but it's a price point I feel more comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm only decreasing the price by $50,000 this time. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm not drastically changing my position.
* **Financial Justification:** I'm again mentioning budget constraints to reinforce my position and create a sense of urgency for Alice.
* **Building Trust:**  By showing willingness to compromise, I'm building trust and making it more likely Alice will continue negotiating with me."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another compromise.
