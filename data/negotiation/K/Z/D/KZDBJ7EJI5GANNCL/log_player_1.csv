"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant amount, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential for both of us to walk away with a good deal.
* **Strategic First Offer:**  By starting high, I create space for Bob to counter-offer, allowing the negotiation to flow naturally. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so I am confident he'll find my offer attractive, as it's still below his perceived value.

**Note:** This is just the first round, and I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my starting offer of $1,200,000. While it's still above my minimum of $800,000, I believe I can do better.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I'm not in a rush to sell.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to explore if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Staying Patient:** With 8 rounds remaining, I have time to counter and try to close the deal at a more favorable price. 

**Next Steps:** 
I will make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 3, aiming to close the gap between our current positions."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a compromise.  I'm meeting Bob halfway from his last offer of $950,000 and my previous offer of $1,200,000. This shows willingness to negotiate while still staying within my desired price range. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  The counteroffer is still well above my minimum of $800,000, ensuring that I'm not giving away too much.
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm aiming to find a price point that is appealing to Bob while still maximizing my own profits. 

**Reasoning:** 

I believe Bob is motivated to buy the product, as it's worth $1,500,000 to him.  By making a reasonable counteroffer, I aim to encourage him to accept and close the deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still lower than my previous counteroffer of $1,050,000. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not desperate to sell at this point.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going. I'm confident I can still get a better price.
* **Time is On My Side:** With six rounds remaining, I have time to counter and try to close the deal at a more favorable price. 

**Next Steps:** 
I will make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 5, aiming to push him closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $975,000 is a small increase from Bob's last offer of $900,000.  This shows I am willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:** The counteroffer is still significantly above my minimum of $800,000, ensuring I get a good price.
* **Closing the Deal:** With only five rounds remaining, it's time to get serious about closing the deal. By offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, I'm increasing the chances he'll accept. 

**Reasoning:**

I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer, as it's still below his perceived value of $1,500,000 and significantly closer to his last offer. However, if he rejects, I'm prepared to continue negotiating in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $880,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not ideal. I have a few rounds left and I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $800,000 is an option, I'm willing to risk another round to potentially secure a better price from Bob.
* **Negotiation Momentum:**  I've been gradually pushing Bob towards my desired price range. I believe with a final counteroffer, I can secure a better deal.

**Next Steps:** 
I will make a final counteroffer to Bob in Round 7, aiming to push him to accept a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** With only three rounds remaining, this is my final counteroffer. I'm aiming for a price that is slightly higher than Bob's last offer of $880,000, but still within a range I believe he will find acceptable.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer represents a compromise, showing I'm willing to work with Bob to find a solution.
* **Time Pressure:**  The remaining rounds are limited, so it's important to make a decision that balances getting a good price with the risk of losing the deal altogether.

**Reasoning:**

I've been steadily pushing Bob towards a higher price. With only three rounds left, I'm confident that this counteroffer will be compelling enough for him to accept.  However, if he rejects, I'll have to carefully evaluate whether to take John's offer or make a final attempt to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is very close to John's offer of $800,000.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm still holding out for a better price.
* **Potential for Improvement:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offers, and with only two rounds remaining, I'm hoping to close the deal at a price closer to $900,000.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While John's offer provides a guaranteed sale, I'm willing to risk one more round to potentially get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** 

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob in Round 9, aiming to secure a deal at a price that is both acceptable to him and profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Push:** This is my final counteroffer, and I'm going all-in to try and get Bob to accept. It's a small increase from his last offer of $850,000 but shows I am willing to compromise.
* **Closing the Gap:** With only one round remaining, I need to strike a balance between securing a decent price and avoiding a stalemate. This offer is a last attempt to close the gap and hopefully finalize a deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm taking a calculated risk by making this counteroffer. If Bob rejects, I'll have to decide between accepting John's offer of $800,000 or walking away with nothing. 

**Reasoning:**

I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer, as it is only a small increase from his last offer and is still below his perceived value of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping he sees this as a fair compromise and finally accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's final offer of $825,000 is only $25,000 more than John's offer. While I'd prefer to get more, it's not a significant enough difference to risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **No Time for More Negotiation:** With only one round left, there's no time to counteroffer and risk Bob rejecting again. 
* **Securing a Sale:** It's important to remember my goal is to make money.  While I would have loved to get closer to my initial target, accepting John's offer ensures a sale and a profit. 

**Reasoning:**

Taking John's offer is the safest option.  It guarantees a sale and secures a substantial profit while minimizing the risk of getting nothing."
