Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $1,200,000 is still under what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price *if* you can guarantee a quick and smooth transaction. No delays, no complications.  Does that work for you?"",

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  By round 5, it's strategic to apply a bit of time pressure.  Bob knows we have John as a backup, but suggesting a quick deal at his price might make him more agreeable.
* **Concession:**  Even though we're aiming higher, accepting $1,200,000 quickly is better than risking a lower offer later or Bob walking away.
* **Conditional Acceptance:**  Framing it as ""accepting *if*"" leaves us a small out if Bob tries to push back on other terms."
