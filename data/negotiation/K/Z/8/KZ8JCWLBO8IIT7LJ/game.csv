"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product of exceptional value. While I can't disclose the exact nature of it, I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm confident it holds significant potential for you as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a price that reflects the product's value and allows for a healthy margin for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. ",1000000.0,Alice,1,
