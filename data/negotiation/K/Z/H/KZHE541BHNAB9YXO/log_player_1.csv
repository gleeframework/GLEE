"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Show enthusiasm:**  I want to make Bob feel like this is a good deal for him, so I express my belief he'll love the product.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm giving Bob space to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:** While I want to make a deal, $110 is below my minimum of $100. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I'm confident that I can get a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer. 
* **Leaving room for more rounds:**  By rejecting the offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm happy to come down a bit, but $110 is still a little too low for me.  How about $120?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's offer, but also demonstrate my willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlight value:** I remind Bob that the product is worth more to him, implying that $120 is still a good deal.
* **Positive framing:** I use phrases like ""fair price"" and ""very happy"" to create a sense of shared benefit and encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about $115? I really think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is only $5 below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited rounds:** We are already halfway through the negotiation rounds, and there is a risk that further rejection could lead to a lower offer or even losing the deal entirely.
* **Better than John's offer:** $115 is still better than the $100 I would get from John.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit.  It's a good compromise given the limited rounds and the potential for further negotiation to go wrong."
