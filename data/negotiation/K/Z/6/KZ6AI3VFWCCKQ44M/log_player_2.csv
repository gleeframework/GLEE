"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let's start the negotiation off strong! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price, closer to our $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a much lower offer ($500,000) than Alice's initial price. This gives us significant room to negotiate and hopefully reach a compromise closer to my target.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By going significantly lower, I'm signaling that I'm serious about getting a good deal and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial counteroffer leaves ample space for Alice to counter, and for us to potentially meet somewhere in the middle over the next several rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our maximum price. There's no point in rejecting and potentially missing out on this price, especially since we can buy it from John for the same amount."
