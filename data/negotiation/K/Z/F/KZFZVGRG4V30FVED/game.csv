"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given its value to me and the fact that I could secure a similar product elsewhere for $800,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800,000, and I'm willing to give you a discount for being a serious buyer.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, as it's right in the middle of our previous offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
