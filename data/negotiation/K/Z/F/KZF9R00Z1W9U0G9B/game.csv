"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit high, but I still think the product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100, which is what John is selling it for. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway at $110, and I'm not willing to go lower than that. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but I need to get at least $115 for the product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
