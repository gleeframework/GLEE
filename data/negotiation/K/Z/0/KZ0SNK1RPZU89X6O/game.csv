"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  This reflects both the value to me and a potential for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's discuss!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand the product is valuable to you, but $900,000 doesn't reflect its full potential.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure a fair return for this unique product.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? This allows for a substantial profit for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
