Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  This reflects both the value to me and a potential for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I believe I can push for a higher price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand the product is valuable to you, but $900,000 doesn't reflect its full potential.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure a fair return for this unique product.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? This allows for a substantial profit for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While it's still below what I initially hoped for, it's a significant improvement and puts me in a good position.  It's also worth noting that we've already spent several rounds of negotiation. Accepting this offer ensures a successful deal and avoids the risk of a breakdown in negotiations."
