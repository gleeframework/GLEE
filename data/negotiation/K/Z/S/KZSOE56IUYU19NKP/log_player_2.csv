{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still above my preferred price point. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to try to get the price even lower to maximize my savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still aiming to stay under $1 million. I'm going to counter with $980,000. This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I need to get closer to the value I know the product holds for you. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be at least $1,020,000 to feel comfortable. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,020,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to try to negotiate further and see if I can get Alice to come down a bit more. I'm also considering the potential of buying from John as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make sure you get a good price.  However, $1,020,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm going to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,010,000, but I need to be at this price or higher to make the deal worthwhile. This is my last offer before considering other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,010,000 is still above my target price.  While I could continue negotiating, we're getting close to my maximum budget, and there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further.  To avoid potentially losing out on a deal completely, it's time to explore my backup option with John. Purchasing from John for $1,200,000 ensures I get the product, even though it's at the higher end of my budget."
