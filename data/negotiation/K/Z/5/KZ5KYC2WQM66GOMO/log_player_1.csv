"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, at least $8,000, but I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. Let me know if this is within your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  He clearly values the product at $15,000, and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering its value to you, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, my budget constraints prevent me from going above $9,500. I hope this meets somewhere in our range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob has demonstrated a willingness to increase his offer. The remaining rounds provide ample opportunity to push for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  Considering your initial valuation, I'm willing to drop to $10,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose $9,750 as a fair price for the product. I believe this respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $9,750, which is only $250 away from my previous offer of $10,000. With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal by rejecting his offer and potentially having to settle for the $8,000 offer from John. This is a reasonable price that allows me to earn significantly more than selling to John."
