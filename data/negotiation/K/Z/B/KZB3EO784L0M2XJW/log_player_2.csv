"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It's logical to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John, it makes more sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
