I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}

I'm lowering the price to $1,800,000. This is still a good amount for me, and I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a more reasonable price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $1,600,000 is a good deal and a significant improvement over John's offer.  There's always the risk that I could reject Bob's offer and end up with nothing, so I'm going to take this opportunity to secure a sale."
