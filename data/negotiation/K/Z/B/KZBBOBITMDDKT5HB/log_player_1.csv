"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $14,000 is too low for me, especially considering the product's worth."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. It's still a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500

``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $15,500 is a good compromise and a fair price for the product. It's also more than what John would pay, so it's a win for me."
