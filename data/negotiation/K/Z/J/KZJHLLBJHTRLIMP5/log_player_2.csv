Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your counter-offer. $8,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little high for me. Would you consider $7,500?  I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering our previous discussions, I am willing to accept $7,750 for the product. I believe this price strikes a good balance between our interests. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to my price range, and further haggling might not yield significant gains. Accepting at $7,750 seems like a reasonable outcome."
