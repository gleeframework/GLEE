"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1600000.0
"I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I have to consider the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1600000 to make it worth my while. It's the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a price of $1000000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on it.",1000000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need $1450000 to make it worth my while. It's the lowest I can go, and I'm starting to think it's getting too close to the product's minimum value to me.",1450000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I'm starting to think that we're getting too far apart, and I'm concerned that the product's value to you is not matching its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1450000, so I'm proposing a price of $1225000. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1225000.0,Bob,6,,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1225000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need $1400000 to make it worth my while. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you.",1400000.0,Alice,7,,
