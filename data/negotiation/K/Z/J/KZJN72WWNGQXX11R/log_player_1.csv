Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above your minimum price.
* **Gauge Interest:** A high initial offer helps you understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he flat-out rejects it, you know he's probably not willing to pay much more than his perceived value. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Remember, Bob only values the product at $10,000.  There's a chance a very high offer could turn him off completely.
* **Alternative Tactics:**  You could try a more nuanced approach by highlighting the product's benefits to Bob and why it's worth more than he thinks."
