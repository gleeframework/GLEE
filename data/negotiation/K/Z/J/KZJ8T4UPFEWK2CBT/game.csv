"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant amount below what it's worth to me, and still well within your budget. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can come down a bit from my initial offer, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,375,000? This would be a fair price that allows me to move forward and you to get this valuable product.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,375,000. How about $1,337,500? That's the highest I can go without going over my budget.",1337500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,337,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,362,500. This is a small adjustment from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.",1362500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $1,362,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $1,340,000? That's the best I can do without going over my budget.",1340000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,340,000 is still a bit too low for me.  While I want to make this deal work, I can't drop below a certain point.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a small adjustment that brings us closer to an agreement. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,7,
