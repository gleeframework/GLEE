"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant amount below what it's worth to me, and still well within your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,450,000, which is a good starting point. It's close to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting that this price is a good deal for both of us. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message clearly indicates that I'm open to further discussion and negotiation. 

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Sets the Tone:** It shows Bob that I'm serious about selling and  willing to negotiate, but also have a firm understanding of the product's value.
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:** It allows for several rounds of counteroffers without immediately reaching my minimum. 
* **Potential for a Quick Deal:** If Bob is agreeable, we could close the deal quickly."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob is willing to pay a premium, his offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I want to keep the negotiation going.  There's still room to find a price that works for both of us. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. I'll aim for a compromise that is fair to both of us."
