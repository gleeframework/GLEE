"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it!

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're close to an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,250.
