"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  I'm looking to sell for $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using friendly language and emphasizing the product's value to Bob to encourage a positive response. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** My initial high price signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm aiming for a final price significantly above Bob's $10,000 valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $22,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While his offer is low, it does indicate some willingness to move. There's room to negotiate and potentially reach a price that works for both of us.
* **John as Backup:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net. If I can't get Bob closer to a reasonable price in the next few rounds, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Could you meet me halfway at $16,500?"", ""product_price"": 16500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between our previous offers. This signals a willingness to compromise but keeps the price significantly above both his initial offer and my minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me understand how flexible Bob is willing to be. If he's open to moving significantly from his initial offer, we have a good chance of reaching an agreement. 
* **John Still an Option:** I'm still open to selling to John if Bob isn't able to come closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $16,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and his offers are increasing.  There's still a chance to reach a price that works for both of us.
* **Approaching Decision Point:**  We're getting closer to my minimum, but I also need to consider the time value.  If Bob doesn't make a substantial jump in the next round, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $15,000 to make this work. How about we settle at $14,500?"", ""product_price"": 14500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($500) to signal I'm reaching my lower limit. 
* **Just Above Minimum:**  This offer is strategically placed slightly above my absolute minimum to allow for a final small concession if needed.
* **Time Pressure:** By Round 5, I'm applying more pressure. Bob needs to make a significant move soon, or I'll likely take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can do $13,500.  Do you think that would work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my absolute minimum of $15,000. I've made it clear I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Slow Progress:**  While Bob is negotiating, his increments are small. It's unlikely he'll reach my minimum in the remaining rounds.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  John offers a guaranteed $15,000. At this point, the certainty and lack of further negotiation make selling to John the more attractive option. 

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take the guaranteed deal with John."
