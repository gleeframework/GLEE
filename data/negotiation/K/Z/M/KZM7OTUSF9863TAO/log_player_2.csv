"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John at this point. Here's why:

* **John's Price:** $10,000
* **Alice's Current Offer:** $10,500

Bob saves $500 by going with John, and further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to bridge that gap without Bob potentially overpaying."
