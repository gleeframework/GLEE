"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $820000, and that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",820000.0,Alice,7,
