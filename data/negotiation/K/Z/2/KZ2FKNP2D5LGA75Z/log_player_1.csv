{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and allows you to greatly benefit from its acquisition. "",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit margin for you. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""exclusive opportunity"" phrasing might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This initial offer anticipates some back-and-forth with Bob. Be prepared to potentially lower your price slightly, but always aim to stay above your $800,000 minimum.
* **Bob's Perspective:** Keep in mind that Bob will also want a good deal.  Understanding his motivations and priorities can be helpful during negotiations."
