"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and allows you to greatly benefit from its acquisition.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John at $1,500,000.  There's room to negotiate with Alice to try and get a price closer to her $800,000 valuation."
