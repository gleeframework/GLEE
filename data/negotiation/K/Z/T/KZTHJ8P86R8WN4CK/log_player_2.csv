# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible item.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price by negotiating further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit less, but I'm still confident in its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?

``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He has successfully negotiated the price down to $1,050,000, which is a significant savings compared to buying from John.  While it's possible to continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and Bob would then be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
