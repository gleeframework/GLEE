"Alice, your offer is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your product has value, but $1,350,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value you've placed on it. Let's try to find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This reflects a significant increase on my end, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
