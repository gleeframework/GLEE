Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for $100, as it's worth at least $150 to me.  I will counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept.  If he doesn't, I can still sell to John for $150, so I'm not losing anything by continuing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is still too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price.  I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and it's clear that we're not going to agree on a price.  I'm going to take John's offer of $150, which is a fair price for the product."
