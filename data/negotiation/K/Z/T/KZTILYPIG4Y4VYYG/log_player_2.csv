"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $135.  While $135 is lower than John's price, Bob can likely get it for less by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's value of $120 as possible. A counteroffer of $125 gives Alice some room to negotiate, but it's still a good deal for Bob compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is lower than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  It's likely Alice will be willing to lower her price further rather than risk Bob going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product as close to Alice's value as possible without risking losing the deal.  $130 is a compromise, and Alice may be willing to accept it to avoid Bob going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $145 is getting closer to John's price of $150.  At this point, Bob is better off buying from John to avoid potentially getting stuck with an even higher price if Alice rejects his next counteroffer.  John's offer is a guaranteed price within Bob's budget."
