"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low.  While I'm not completely against selling to him, I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll try to counter-offer him and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11250. I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm getting closer to my desired price, but I'm not willing to settle for $11,250 just yet. I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,250 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  Let's try $11,750. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and value. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11750 is getting closer to my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $11000. I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's getting closer and I'm running out of time. It's better to get $11,000 than to risk getting only $10,000 from John."
