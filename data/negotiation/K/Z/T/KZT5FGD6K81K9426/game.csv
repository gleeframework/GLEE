"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10000 is a bit below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12500?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11250. I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value as well.",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11250 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  Let's try $11750. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and value. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
