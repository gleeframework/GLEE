Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, there's a chance to earn an extra $100,000 if Bob accepts our offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario. Bob gets a $100,000 discount from the product's true worth to him, and we gain a significant profit margin.
* **Exclusivity:** By framing the offer as ""exclusive,"" we subtly emphasize the value and potentially motivate Bob to act quickly."
