"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $95?  This is a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we aim for $90? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still acquiring the product.",90.0,Bob,4,
