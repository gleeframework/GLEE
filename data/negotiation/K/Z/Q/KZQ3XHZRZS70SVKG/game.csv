"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $9,000 is tempting, it's a bit below what I need to make this deal work. Would you consider $10,500? This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,250. Can we go with that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,250 is still a bit low for me. Would you be willing to come up to $10,750? This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the sale.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my budget, but I'm still not willing to go above $10,250. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $10,625 is the highest I can go. Can we finalize the deal at that price?",10625.0,Bob,6,
