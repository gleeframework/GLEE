{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This allows you to potentially make a profit while still being flexible.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand the offer. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, I can see if Bob is truly interested and see what his counteroffer might be. If he rejects my offer, I can always lower the price slightly or even choose to sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $9,000 is tempting, it's a bit below what I need to make this deal work. Would you consider $10,500? This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,250. Can we go with that?

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $10,250 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further but I want to try and get a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer again and see if we can reach a compromise."

Bob's offer:

While $10,625 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to risk losing another round of negotiation and potentially falling further below my desired price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum of $15,000."
