{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but it's still lower than my minimum. This strategy allows for room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept and get a sale, I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
