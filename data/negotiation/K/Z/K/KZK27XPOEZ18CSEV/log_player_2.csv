Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $16,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows me some room to negotiate. What do you say?
