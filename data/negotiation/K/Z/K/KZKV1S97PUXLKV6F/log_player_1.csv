Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to mutual benefit:**  I'm framing it as a good deal for both of us, emphasizing a potential win-win scenario.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, leaving the door open for counteroffers.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great!  I've secured a profitable sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* **If the negotiation stalls:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired price, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob is willing to pay more than his initial valuation.
* **John's offer provides security:**  Knowing I have John's offer as a safety net allows me to be more assertive in negotiations.

**Next Step:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer that aims to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing you to get a good deal while ensuring I don't lose out on too much.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a profit:**  $1,350,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to keep the negotiation friendly and encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Excellent!  We've reached an agreement.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer, taking into account my minimum price and John's offer.
* **If the negotiation stalls:**  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm always prepared to accept John's offer if necessary."
