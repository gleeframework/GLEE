{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good deal, there's potential to save even more. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $85, but still leaves some room for compromise. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal and am willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $80 is slightly better than her initial offer, but I'm still hoping to get a lower price. There are still 7 rounds remaining, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and get closer to my target price of $75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 78}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $78. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still want a good deal. It's a small enough increase that she might be willing to accept, especially since I'm getting closer to her desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $79 is very close to my target price of $75. It's a good deal, and continuing to negotiate might risk her walking away. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product and save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
