"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. However, given the cost of production and the value the product holds for us, we cannot accept $85. I propose a price of $90 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit while considering the value it holds for you. I hope this offer meets your expectations.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your proposal, Bob. While I appreciate your attempt to find a middle ground, I must respectfully decline. Our costs and the value we place on the product suggest a minimum acceptable price of $90. However, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $89 for the product. This still provides a reasonable profit for us while considering the value it holds for you.",89.0,Alice,5,
