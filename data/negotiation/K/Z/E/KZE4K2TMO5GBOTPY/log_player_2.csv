{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's willing to pay a maximum of $10,000 and Alice is asking for more than that.  It's best to start negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than his maximum price. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

Bob should offer $10,500. This is a compromise - it's higher than his initial offer but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. It shows that he's willing to negotiate but is also committed to his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At this point, Alice has come down to his proposed price of $10,500. While he could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice could reject his counteroffer and increase her price again. Additionally, he's only got a few rounds left.  Accepting this offer means he gets the product for a price that is within his budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John at a slightly higher price."
