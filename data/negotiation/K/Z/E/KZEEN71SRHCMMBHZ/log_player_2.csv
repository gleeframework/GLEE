"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts.

While Alice's offer is lower than her value, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a good profit while giving you a fair deal. What do you think?

Alice's offer is now within my budget, but it's still higher than what John is offering. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option."
