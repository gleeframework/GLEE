"Thank you for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $13,000. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today. What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I'm really interested in this product, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $13,250? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close today.",13250.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about we do $13,500, but I'll throw in some additional support and maintenance services worth $500? That way, you'll get an even better deal!",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer and the added services. While I appreciate the gesture, I'm still focused on getting the best possible price for the product itself. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is closer to my budget and what I believe is fair considering the value. What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $13,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",13750.0,Alice,9,
