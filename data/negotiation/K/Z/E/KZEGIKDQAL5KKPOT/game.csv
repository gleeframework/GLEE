,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $80? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $85? I'm really interested in this product and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I know you'll be happy with this product.",90.0,Alice,5,
