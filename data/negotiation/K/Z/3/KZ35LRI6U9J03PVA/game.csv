Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1200000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1520000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",1520000.0,Alice,5,
