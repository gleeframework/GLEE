"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $100 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but I'm only able to offer $85 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. Bob is aiming to secure a good deal while leaving room for potential further negotiation.  $85 is still within Bob's budget, but it puts pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest,  $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice has come down a bit, $95 is still above Bob's ideal price. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $95 is closer, but I'm still only able to offer $90.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows he's willing to compromise but is still pushing for a lower price.  $90 is still a good deal for him, but it allows for a bit more negotiation if needed."
