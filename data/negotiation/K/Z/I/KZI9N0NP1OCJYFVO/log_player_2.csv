"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Accepting Alice's offer at $1,000,000 is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Saving money:** Buying from Alice saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Within budget:** The price is well within Bob's $1,200,000 budget. 

While Bob could potentially try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee of success, and the risk of losing the product to John is not worth it."
