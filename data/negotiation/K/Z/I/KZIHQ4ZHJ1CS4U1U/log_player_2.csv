{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product, which is a bit higher than my target price of $80, but I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 85}"

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product, which is a bit lower than my previous offer of $85, but I'm trying to get as close to my target price of $80 as possible.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's final offer of $87 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm not sure if I want to risk going back and forth anymore. I think I'll reject her offer and consider buying from John for $100, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I think there's been a mistake! I chose to reject Alice's offer and consider buying from John, not make another counteroffer. Since I've already rejected Alice's offer, I should be able to buy from John for $100 if I want to.

However, I'll go ahead and make another counteroffer to Alice, just in case. I'll try to get as close to my target price of $80 as possible.

{""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $87, but I'm willing to meet you at $83. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 83}"
