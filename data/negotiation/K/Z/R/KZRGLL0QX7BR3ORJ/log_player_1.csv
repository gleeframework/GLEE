Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer allows me to make a profit while still leaving some room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a bit more than that, but I'm not giving it away for cheap either."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can't afford $10,000 for the product. Could you consider lowering the price to $9,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stick to a price closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to pay $9,500? This would allow both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet the price of $9,500. Could you consider lowering the price to $9,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob.  While $9,000 is more than what the product is worth to him, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  To maximize my profit, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000."
