Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $130. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $127. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go down to a price that works for you. You've made a good effort to negotiate, but at this point, cutting your losses and buying from John for $100 is the most financially sensible option."
