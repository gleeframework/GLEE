"Hi Alice, thanks for offering. However, $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price Alice, but it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $95? That's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $130. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $127. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product!",127.0,Alice,5,
