"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. I think it's a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible. $95 is still above your desired price point of $100. It's better to reject the offer and see if you can get a better deal from Alice in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $95 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price. It's below Alice's minimum value of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation and shows you're serious about buying the product. It's also close enough to the ""John"" price ($100) to make it a worthwhile negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to your desired price point, it's still above your ideal price of $100.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer gives you a chance to get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's in between Alice's last offer and your previous counteroffer, showing a willingness to meet in the middle. This also brings the price closer to your ideal price point, and increases the chances of Alice accepting."
