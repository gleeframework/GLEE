"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own minimum requirements. If you're interested, let's discuss the details further. If not, I have another buyer who is willing to purchase it for $800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
