"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1000000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not able to meet the price of $1500000. Could we possibly negotiate down to $1200000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
