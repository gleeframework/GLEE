"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm still making a profit.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about $8,000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already compromised a lot by offering you $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is still a discount from my initial offer, but I need to make a profit. It's the best I can do.",9500.0,Alice,5,
