Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! While $97 is still a bit lower than my target, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer you the product for $102. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while there's a chance to get it lower, the difference is getting small enough that it's risky to keep pushing. Accepting at $102 secures a decent discount."
