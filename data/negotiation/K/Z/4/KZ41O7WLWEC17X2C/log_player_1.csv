Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $140 for it."", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $120, aiming for a higher profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $140 is less than the $150 Bob values the product at, making it likely he'll be interested.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for potential counteroffers and a chance to meet in the middle."
