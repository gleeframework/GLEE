Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Given its value to you, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
