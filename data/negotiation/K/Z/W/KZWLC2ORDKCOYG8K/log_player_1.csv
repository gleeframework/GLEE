Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you first chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and while my asking price is $1,400,000, I'm open to discussing a figure that benefits us both. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000 sets a strong floor.  Starting negotiations significantly below this allows room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leaving room for Bob:** While $1,400,000 is more than Bob's perceived value, it acknowledges there's room for discussion and potential compromise.
* **Encouraging a counter-offer:**  The message is phrased to make Bob feel valued and encourage him to counter with a price he deems fair. This gives Alice more information to work with.

**Why this is better than simply asking for $1,500,000:**

* **Potential for higher profit:**  Bob might value the product more than $1,000,000 or be willing to stretch his budget if he sees its potential.
* **Avoiding a stalled negotiation:**  Demanding the absolute maximum upfront could make Bob immediately disengage, losing Alice a potential sale above her guaranteed amount."
