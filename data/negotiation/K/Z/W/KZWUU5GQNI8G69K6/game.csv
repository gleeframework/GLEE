"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,000,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to go slightly lower, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
