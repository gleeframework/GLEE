Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll reap."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed offer from John, your goal is to maximize profit. Aiming slightly below John's offer allows room for negotiation and potential profit above your minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting with a high but not unreasonable price anchors the negotiation in your favor. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though Bob's perceived value is lower.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  Keep in mind that Bob only values the product at $800,000. There's a risk he'll find the offer too high, even with negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyers:**  Having John as a backup ensures you won't be forced to accept a low offer from Bob."
