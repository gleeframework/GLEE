"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer ($14,000). It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Offering $13,000 is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still potentially profitable for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,500, which is only $500 more than Bob's last counteroffer. This is a good deal for Bob, as he can buy the product for less than his maximum budget of $15,000 and save $1,500 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential benefits."
