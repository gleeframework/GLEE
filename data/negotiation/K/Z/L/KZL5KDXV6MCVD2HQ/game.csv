"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity but I'm going to have to counter with $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your own valuation.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your perspective, I need to maintain my position for the sake of maximizing the value for our company. I am willing to consider $900,000 as a counteroffer. This still allows us to retain a significant profit margin while offering you a substantial discount compared to the product's true value.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be.  I'm going to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest proposal, Bob. I appreciate your efforts in reaching a mutual agreement. Considering the value of the product and aiming to find a balance, I am prepared to offer $890,000 as a counteroffer.
