# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your perspective, I need to maintain my position for the sake of maximizing the value for our company.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest proposal, Bob. I appreciate your efforts in reaching a mutual agreement. Considering the value of the product and aiming to find a balance, I am prepared to offer $890,000 as a counteroffer. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our respective positions, allowing us to move forward with a transaction that benefits both parties.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is close to Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000.  It's also significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000, making it a good deal for Bob.  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price.  Continuing to negotiate risks the chance of Alice pulling back or Bob having to pay John's higher price."
