Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you aim to get as close to that as possible from Bob. 
* **High but Negotiable:**  $14,999 is a strong starting point. It signals the product's value while leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Psychology:** The slightly-below-$15,000 price might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal than he actually is.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might reject this offer. However, it represents a calculated risk to maximize your potential profit. If Bob rejects it, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
