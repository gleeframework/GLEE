Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my needs, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I still can't go above $1,000,000 for the product. I think $950,000 would be a fair compromise. Let's aim for that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:** Bob is stubbornly refusing to budge above $1,000,000. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer means a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the sale with John."
