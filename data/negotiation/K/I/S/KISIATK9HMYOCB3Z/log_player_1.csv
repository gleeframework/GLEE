Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. Can you consider this counteroffer?

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to get a better price from Bob.  I'm not confident I can reach a deal with him before time runs out.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, so that's the best option at this point."
