"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me while still being a good value for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. Can you consider this counteroffer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This is still a good deal for you as you're getting the product for significantly less than what it's worth to me.  Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $9,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,375. Can you consider this counteroffer?",9375.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,375 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $9,562.50. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9562.5,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're at an impasse.  While I'm open to negotiation, I can't go any lower than $9,400. This is still a fantastic deal for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment.  Let's see if we can find a compromise at this price.  I'm confident that this is a fair offer for both of us.",9400.0,Alice,7,
