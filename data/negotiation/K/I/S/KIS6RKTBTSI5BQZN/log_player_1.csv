Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $15,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially securing a significantly higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the higher price without revealing your absolute minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's financial situation or how much he's willing to pay. If you had more information about Bob, you might adjust your strategy accordingly."
