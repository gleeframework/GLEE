Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I want to see if he's truly interested in the product and what his budget might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price.  I need to make sure I get closer to my minimum value, or at least get a counteroffer that demonstrates Bob is serious about buying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum. Hopefully, this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to drop my price significantly lower. I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John.  $1,200,000 is a fair price and it ensures I get at least my minimum value."
