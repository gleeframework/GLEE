"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Could you do $17,000?  I'm willing to be a bit flexible if we can find a good middle ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $17,000 is still too steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
