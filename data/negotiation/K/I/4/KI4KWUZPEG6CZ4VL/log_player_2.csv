"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you, and enabling me to achieve a price closer to my desired range. I understand that you may be hesitant, but I believe this offer represents a fair compromise. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, so don't miss out on this opportunity! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your backup option with John. By rejecting her offer, you're not losing the opportunity to buy the product, you're simply moving to a stronger negotiating position."
