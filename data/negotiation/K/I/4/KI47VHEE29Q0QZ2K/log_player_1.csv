While Bob is getting very close to my minimum price, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  I've made significant concessions and it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that meets both of our needs.  It's time to move on and secure the sale with John."
