"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price.  While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I can't go down to $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $13,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more breathing room.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12500. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $12,500 is closer to my target, I still believe I can get a higher price.  I'm not quite ready to settle for that just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $13,000 is a good price for me, and it seems like Bob is at his limit.  I'd rather secure the sale than risk losing him and having to settle for John's lower offer."
