"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. It's important to be aggressive early on to maximize my profits, while also being realistic and willing to compromise.  I'll be watching Bob's response carefully to adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a compromise, but I won't settle for anything less than what I truly believe the product is worth.  Selling to John is always an option, but I'd prefer to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's acceptable to me. This shows that I'm open to negotiation, but also that I won't give away the product for a price that undervalues it.  This counteroffer should help us get closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to be firm on my minimum price point.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John remains a viable option, but I'm committed to seeing if I can close a deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

I'm continuing to be flexible, but I'm also sticking to my minimum price point.  This offer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also ensuring that I don't undervalue the product. I'm hoping this will be the deal that clinches the sale with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $1,225,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I won't settle for anything less than what I truly believe the product is worth. Selling to John is always an option, but I'd prefer to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,225,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. This would be a fair compromise and allows us to finally close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm increasing my offer a bit, showing that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob.  It's a small increase, but hopefully enough to convince him to accept. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still have some room to maneuver if needed.  With only a few rounds remaining, I need to make a strong push to secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make this work, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiations have stalled.  Bob's offer is still too low for me.  While I want to reach a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to compromise my minimum price point.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
