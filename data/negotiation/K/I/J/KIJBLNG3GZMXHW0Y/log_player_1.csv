Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $12,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth!"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and benefits might make Bob more receptive to a higher price.
* **Alternative:**  Keeping John's offer in mind provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, Alice can always fall back on that $10,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a great value, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for More:** While $9,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below Alice's minimum. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open for a potentially better deal. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Having John's offer ensures Alice doesn't have to settle for a price significantly below her target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $9,000 is a significant drop from my initial price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Coming down to $10,500 shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above Alice's minimum.
* **Middle Ground:**  Suggesting a ""middle ground"" can be a persuasive tactic to encourage agreement.
* **Value Emphasis:** Re-emphasizing the product's value reinforces its worth in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $9,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's above Alice's minimum of $10,000 and demonstrates a willingness to meet Bob halfway. 
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation might not yield significantly better results. Accepting now secures a good price without further hassle.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance Bob might walk away if Alice pushes for more. Accepting the $9,500 offer guarantees a profit."
