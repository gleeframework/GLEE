"I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. Let's meet in the middle.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  It's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $112.50?",112.5,Bob,6,
