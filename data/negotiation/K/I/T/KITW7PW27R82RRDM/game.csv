"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very attractive price.  I'm asking $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than you do. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,350,000? This reflects both the value to you and the need for me to make a decent profit. Let me know if this works for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,325,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
