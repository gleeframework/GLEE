,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for.  Could you do $17,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Can we meet in the middle again?",14000.0,Bob,4,
