"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is within his budget, it's still a significant markup from Alice's own valuation of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's time to work out a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Given your own valuation of the product, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me a reasonable margin.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,325,000? This price acknowledges the value you see in the product while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,325,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price.  There are still 7 rounds left, so there's ample time to see if a more favorable deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,287,500. This is a fair and reasonable price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1287500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting close! I understand your desire to find a price that works for you, but I need to be mindful of my own minimum. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This is a firm offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. $1,300,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely get it lower. There are still 5 rounds remaining, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating. There is a chance that Alice will eventually come down to Bob's desired price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,300,000.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $1,293,750. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1293750}
