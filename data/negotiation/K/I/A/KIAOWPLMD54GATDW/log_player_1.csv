Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Given your own valuation of the product, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me a reasonable margin.  What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
