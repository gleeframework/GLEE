Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000 in the right hands. I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000.  This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and you have a guaranteed sale for that amount to John, you have leverage to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Strategic Opening:** Starting with an offer of $1,750,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while aiming for a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value to Bob, potentially justifying the higher price in his mind.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone remains open for Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer, allowing you to gauge his interest and adjust if needed.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still providing an opportunity to secure a deal with Bob."
