# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to make it a great deal for you. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is better than John's price of $1,200,000, but there's still room for negotiation. I can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's initial offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $950,000 is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above my preferred range. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still a bit concerned that $875,000 is below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $950,000, which is $912,500.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $912,500 is closer to my target price, it's still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price.  It's likely that Alice is still trying to maximize her profit, and I can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
