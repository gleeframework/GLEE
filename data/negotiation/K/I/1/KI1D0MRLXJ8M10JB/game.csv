"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm confident that $875,000 is a fair price that benefits both of us.  This is my final offer, and I'm eager to close the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still a bit concerned that $875,000 is below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $950,000, which is $912,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $912,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm firm on $890,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's make it happen!",890000.0,Bob,6,
