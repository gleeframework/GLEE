Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position that gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  I'm confident that the product is valuable enough to warrant this price, and I'm hoping to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy to get my minimum price, I'm not willing to accept Bob's first offer. I believe the product is worth more and I'm going to try to get closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still a significant amount. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is too low.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's unlikely I'll get closer to my desired price. I'm going to take the safe option and sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This guarantees me my minimum value and avoids any further risk of a lower offer."
