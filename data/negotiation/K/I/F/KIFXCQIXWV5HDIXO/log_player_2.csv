{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still believe the product's value to you is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,500 is a better price than $12,000,  Bob still believes he can get a better deal. He should continue to negotiate to see if he can get closer to his target price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's see if we can agree on a price in this range."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I still think the product's value to you is higher than $10,500. I'm willing to come down another $250 and offer it to you for $11,250. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,250 is closer to his target price, he can likely still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He's already managed to bring the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer of $12,000, so he should keep pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the progress we've made.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, Bob. However, I still think the product's value to you is higher than $11,000. I'm willing to come down another $100 and offer it to you for $10,900. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's managed to negotiate the price down to $10,900, which is very close to his target price of $10,000.  There's a good chance he won't be able to get a better deal with further negotiation, and it's worth risking a small loss to get the product quickly rather than risk losing it entirely by continuing to negotiate.  If he rejects this offer and continues to negotiate, he may be forced to buy the product from John at $15,000, which would be a much worse outcome."
