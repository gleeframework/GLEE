"Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of significant interest to you. I'm asking for $1500000 for it. It's a one-time opportunity and I believe it's well worth the investment. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1200000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? This would allow both of us to benefit from this opportunity. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's my maximum. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1300000 as a final concession. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe this product will be worth every penny to you.  Is this something you can work with?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1250000, which would be $1225000. Can you consider that?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $1225000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1275000, which is a significant compromise for me. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal work. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to pay $1275000. I'm willing to go up to $1225000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",1225000.0,Bob,8,
