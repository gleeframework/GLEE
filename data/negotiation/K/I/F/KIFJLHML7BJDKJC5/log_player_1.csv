"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  This is to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's tempting to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation,  I believe I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my offer from $170 to $130. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150 and closer to Bob's initial offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but we are getting closer.  While it's tempting to sell to John for $150, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $125. This is a significant compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it's closer to Bob's latest offer. I hope this will convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is only $5 more than what the product is worth to him, and it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've already made significant compromises, and there are only 4 rounds remaining. At this point, it's more beneficial to sell to John for $150, ensuring a profit and avoiding the risk of further negotiations that might not yield a better outcome."
