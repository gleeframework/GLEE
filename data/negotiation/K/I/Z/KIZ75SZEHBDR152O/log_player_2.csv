"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $75. I believe this price reflects its high value and quality, making it a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While $75 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get the price closer to his $80 limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer at $70 for the product. This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70.

Alice is moving closer to Bob's ideal price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $65."
