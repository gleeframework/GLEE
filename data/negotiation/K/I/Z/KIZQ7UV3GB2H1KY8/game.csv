"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $900,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'd be willing to increase my offer to $700,000. That's a fair deal considering its true value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
