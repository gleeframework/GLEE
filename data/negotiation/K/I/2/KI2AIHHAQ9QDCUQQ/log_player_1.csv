Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth even more than Bob initially thinks. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique value"" subtly implies the product might be worth more than Bob's estimated $8,000.
* **Gauge Interest:** The open-ended question ""What are your thoughts?"" encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than just saying a flat ""yes"" or ""no."" 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
