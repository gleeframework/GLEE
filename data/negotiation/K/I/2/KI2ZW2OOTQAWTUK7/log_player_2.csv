"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm looking for a price of $14,000 to make this a win-win. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, $11,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line. Could you meet me halfway at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to her value, but there's still room for negotiation.  We'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground between our last offer and her current one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $11,750?"",
""product_price"": 11750
}
```

This counter-offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing some real potential for us to make a deal here.  How about we split the difference again and land at $12,125? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and while there might be a tiny bit more room for negotiation,  $12,125 is a reasonable price. It's a good deal compared to John's offer, and continuing to negotiate might make Alice pull out."
