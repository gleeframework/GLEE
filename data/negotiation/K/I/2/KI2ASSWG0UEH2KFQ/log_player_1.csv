Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that better reflects my valuation of the product. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1350000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,375,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still have room to negotiate and try to reach a higher price. I'm not at a point where I feel the need to immediately accept his offer or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. To make this happen, I'm offering the product to you at $1,390,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1390000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting very close to my desired price.  $1,385,000 is a reasonable compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $1,200,000.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a good deal and avoids further rounds of potentially less favorable outcomes."
