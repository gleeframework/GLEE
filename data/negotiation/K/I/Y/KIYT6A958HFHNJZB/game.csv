"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it, as it's the maximum I'm comfortable spending. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $120. It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $120, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,5,
