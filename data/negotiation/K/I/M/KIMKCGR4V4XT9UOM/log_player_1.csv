I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Bob's offer of $990,000 is very close, but I'm concerned that he's going to keep pushing for a lower price. I don't want to risk getting stuck in another round of negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my target price."
