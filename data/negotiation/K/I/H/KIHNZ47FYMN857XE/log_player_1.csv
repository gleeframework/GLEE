{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'd rather sell to him than risk further negotiation or losing the sale to John."
