"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at her minimum, so there's room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a better price before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counteroffer at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target, I still want to try to push for a lower price. It's still within my budget and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but $1,150,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm going to counteroffer at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is within my budget and getting closer to my target price.  There's always a chance she might go lower, but it's risky to keep pushing.  If I reject this offer and she holds firm, I'm forced to buy from John for a higher price.  It's time to take the deal."
