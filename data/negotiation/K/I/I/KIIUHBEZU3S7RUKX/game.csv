"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1200000 is out of my budget. I'm very interested in this product and am willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident this product is worth $800000 to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal at that price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, and $800000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
