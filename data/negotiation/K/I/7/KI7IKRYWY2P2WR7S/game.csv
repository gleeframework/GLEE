"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $7,500? It's a fair price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8,500. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
