Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John gives you leverage. Bob might be more inclined to accept knowing he's getting a better deal than your backup offer.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
