Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes the product as high-value from the outset.
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price acts as an anchor. While Bob might not accept it, it sets a reference point for further negotiation.  Any subsequent offers, even if lower, will seem more reasonable in comparison. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first offer is also about gathering information. Bob's response will reveal how eager he is to buy and potentially signal his own upper limit. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while being prepared to negotiate strategically based on Bob's reactions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a significant jump down, indicating he's very interested but wants to see how low you'll go.  You're still well above your minimum and have room to negotiate strategically. Selling to John right now would mean leaving a lot of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While my initial asking price reflected its full potential, I'm willing to negotiate for a serious buyer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This classic negotiation tactic suggests fairness and movement towards a deal.  
* **Holding Firm (for now):**  While you're coming down in price, you're not conceding too much at once. You're still significantly above Bob's offer and holding onto a good portion of the potential profit.
* **Encouraging a Response:**  By phrasing your counteroffer as a question, you subtly invite Bob to engage further and reveal more about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,650,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** While not the initial $1,900,000,  $1,650,000 is a significant profit margin on a product with a $1,000,000 floor for you.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away increases with each round.  
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows you to reinvest the earnings sooner, potentially earning a return on that capital.

Bob has shown he's willing to pay a premium, and accepting at this point secures a very favorable outcome for you."
