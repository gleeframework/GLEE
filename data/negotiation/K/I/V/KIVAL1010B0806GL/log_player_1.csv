Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a competitive price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate if Bob counters. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's worth to you, it implies value by calling it ""a competitive price.""

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** You don't know how much Bob is willing to spend over his perceived value ($10,000). This offer might be too high, but it's a starting point.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or reject your initial price. Having a negotiation strategy in place will be important."
