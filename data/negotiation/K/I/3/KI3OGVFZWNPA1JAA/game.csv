"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I'm confident it's a fair offer.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,275,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting the sense we're not very far apart. Let's split the difference.  I'll offer you the product for $1,312,500.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1312500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,312,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,256,250. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done.",1256250.0,Bob,6,
