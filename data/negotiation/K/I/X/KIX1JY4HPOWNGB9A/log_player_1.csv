Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A positive and encouraging message will make Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates that I'm open to discussing the price further. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've earned a good profit!
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own.
* **Stalemate:**  If negotiations stall, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum price.**  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not yet willing to sell below $15,000.
* **I have a guaranteed alternative.**  Selling to John for $15,000 gives me a safer option than accepting a lower price from Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price with Bob or move on to John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $13,000 and $14,000.
* **Stalemate:** If Bob refuses my counteroffer, I can choose to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $13,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $13,500? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and keeps us both happy. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a slight compromise by lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,500. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging tone helps keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great!  I've secured a decent profit.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John. If I choose to counteroffer, I might lower my price a bit more, but I'll likely try to keep it above $13,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum.**  While I'd prefer to earn more, Bob's offer is my absolute bottom line. 
* **No room for further negotiation.**  I've already compromised twice, and there's no indication that Bob is willing to go higher.
* **Guaranteed profit.** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  This is a safer and more profitable option than risking further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Sell to John:** I will contact John and finalize the sale for $15,000."
