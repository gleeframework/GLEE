"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which holds immense value for us at $15,000. Considering its significance and the benefits it would bring to you, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored specifically for you, leveraging our mutual interests and potential for a fruitful partnership. I believe this price reflects the true value and the unique benefits the product offers, making it an exceptional deal. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information to make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's flowery language about ""mutual interests"" and ""fruitful partnerships"" doesn't change the facts.  She's offering the product for $14,000, but you know you have a backup option at $15,000. There's room to negotiate. By rejecting her offer, you signal you're not desperate and might entice her to come down closer to her $10,000 value."
