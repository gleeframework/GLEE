"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price that reflects the product's full potential for you. How about $1,300,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while ensuring a fair return for me.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,250,000 is the maximum I can go. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
