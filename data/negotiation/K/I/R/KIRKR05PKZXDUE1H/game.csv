I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?,1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer of $1200000, Bob. However, I was really hoping to get a bit more for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1350000, which is a compromise between our two numbers. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1250000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised by offering you a price that's $100000 less than my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $1300000, which is $50000 more than your last offer. Is this something you'd be willing to accept?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm going to make one final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. The price is $1300000.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
