Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering its value and the opportunity it presents.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price allows for a few rounds of counteroffers without immediately resorting to John's offer.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes fairness and opportunity to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.**  
* **There's still room for negotiation.** While his offer is low, it's a starting point for further discussion. 
* **I can potentially get a better price by counteroffering.**  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly lower than what I need to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This price recognizes your value and allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  Instead of rejecting outright, I'm offering a counter that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on meeting in the middle:** This framing suggests a willingness to be flexible and find common ground.
* **Remaining firm on value:** I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000, but I'm showing a desire to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.** While it's closer to my desired range, it's not enough to make it worthwhile to sell to him at this point.
* **There's still room for further negotiation.** I'm not yet ready to sell to John, and I believe we can still reach a more favorable agreement with Bob.
* **A counteroffer might be successful.** I can try to bridge the gap by offering a slightly lower price, potentially leading to a deal that's closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is closer, I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference at $1,000,000? This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is a final counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** Highlighting the ""split the difference"" aspect emphasizes a fair compromise.
* **Meeting Minimum Value:**  This offer allows me to sell at my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Closing:**  The message remains positive and encouraging to reach a deal."
