"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
