"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth more to you than that. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $10500?  That's a fair price considering the value to both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000 to meet you halfway.  This still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11000 is still a little out of my range.  How about $10750?  That's a good compromise, and it's closer to where I need to be.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  But $10750 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10875? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  How about $10800?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",10800.0,Bob,6,
