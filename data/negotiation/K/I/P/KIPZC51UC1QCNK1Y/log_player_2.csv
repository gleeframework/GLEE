"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth more to you than that. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good price, Bob can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000 to meet you halfway.  This still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target.  He can continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little out of my range.  How about $10,750?  That's a good compromise, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  But $10750 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10875? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still very close to his goal of paying $10,500. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  While $10,875 is closer to his target, it's still not the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  How about $10,800?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10800}
