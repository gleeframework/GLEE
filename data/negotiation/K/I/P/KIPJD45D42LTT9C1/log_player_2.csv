**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. It's always worth trying to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price. If negotiation fails, you can always fall back on John's offer."

Alice has come down from her initial price, but it's still higher than the price I'm comfortable with. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if I can get it lower. If I can't, I can always buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1320000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While I'm still hoping for a bit lower,  $1,320,000 is a good price, and it's less than what John is offering.  It's probably a good time to accept the deal."
