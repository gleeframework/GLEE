Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate, while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counter-offering at $110. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise while still holding firm on a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $105 is a reasonable compromise, and it's more than I would get by selling to John.  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result, and it risks losing the deal entirely."
