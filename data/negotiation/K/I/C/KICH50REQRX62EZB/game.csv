"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I know the true potential this product holds and  $1,200,000 undervalues it significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as I have other interested buyers.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I can get from the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
