"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I can meet you in the middle at $15000. Let me know if that works for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13500?  This would give you a good price and allow me to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your creative offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. I can do $14000, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if you're interested.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm really struggling to go above $13000.  Let's meet in the middle at $13500, and I'll be happy to close the deal today.",13500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, so I'll do $14500. Let me know if that works for you.",14500.0,Alice,7,
