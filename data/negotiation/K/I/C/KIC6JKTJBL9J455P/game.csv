"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $20,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your offer, the $10,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $12,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me and allows us both to make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
