# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $20,000. I believe it will be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is way above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's not even worth considering accepting it. You should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $20,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your offer, the $10,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. You can try to negotiate further. John is offering a better deal, but it's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target price with Alice."
