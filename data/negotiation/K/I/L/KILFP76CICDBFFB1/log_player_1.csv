Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $120 (this is my ""fallback"" price if Bob rejects the offer).
* **Bob's maximum acceptable price:** $100
* **Negotiation space:**  To maximize profit, I want to get as close to my minimum as possible.

Offering $115 gives me a decent profit while still being within a reasonable range for Bob to potentially accept. This way, I'm not losing out on potential profit, but still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
