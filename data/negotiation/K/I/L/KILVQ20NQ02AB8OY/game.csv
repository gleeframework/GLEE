"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  I believe this price is fair considering my needs and the market value.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  I'm confident you'll see the immense value at this price point.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product.  This represents a significant investment on my part and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to compromise.  I'm still trying to stay within my budget and am only able to offer $925,000.  This is a significant amount of money for me, and I believe it represents a fair value for the product.  Let's see if we can bridge this small gap and finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
