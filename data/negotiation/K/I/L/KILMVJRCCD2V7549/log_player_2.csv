"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $13,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a better price than John's $15,000, there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm prepared to offer $12,500 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I believe the product's value to you is worth it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is lower than John's price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer keeps Bob's leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's work together to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $13,500, which is closer to my minimum price, but still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is the best price she has offered so far, and it's still lower than John's price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed that he'll get a better price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing it."
