"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we bring the price down significantly to something more manageable?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, my initial offer reflects the true value of this product.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still quite a bit higher than what I had in mind.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. This demonstrates my serious interest, but I need us to be in a more realistic range to make a deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,
