"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'll offer the product to you for $10,500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'll offer the product to you for $10,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its value to you.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,250 is closer, I'm still hoping to land closer to $9,750.  Would that be workable for you?",9750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'll make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $10,150. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",10150.0,Alice,7,
