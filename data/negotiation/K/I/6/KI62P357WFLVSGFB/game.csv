"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to balance that with the value I'm looking to get for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10500.  This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $10750. This is my final offer in this range, and I hope we can agree on a price.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10750 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. My final offer is $10250. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's worth to me.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11000. This is the minimum I can accept for the product. If you're still interested, I'm willing to discuss further, but I need to be firm on this price.",11000.0,Alice,7,
