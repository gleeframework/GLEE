"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating for a lower price. You can always purchase from John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end. It's closer to my budget and still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can close the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution.  While $1,100,000 is closer to the mark, it's still below what I can accept.  I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,225,000. This is my absolute bottom line, reflecting the product's true value.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,225,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There's a good chance further negotiation won't bring the price down enough.  It's better to secure the product from John at your budget limit."
