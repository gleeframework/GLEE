Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's still lower than what I can get from John. This strategy allows for some negotiation room, while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell the product for $90. I can make more money by either negotiating with Bob or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $105. This would still give me a decent profit and hopefully is more in your price range."", ""product_price"": 105}
