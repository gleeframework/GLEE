You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better deal. There's no guarantee Alice will lower her price, but it's worth a shot to try and save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price. It's a bold move, but Bob is aiming for a substantial saving. This counteroffer will test Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $700,000 is a good deal.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will become stubborn or walk away entirely. At this point, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
