"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market demand.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as high as $750,000. I'm willing to compromise again, but I think $850,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a concession to move the negotiation forward.",850000.0,Alice,5,
