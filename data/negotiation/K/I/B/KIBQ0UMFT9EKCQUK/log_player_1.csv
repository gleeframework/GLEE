Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its potential for your business, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. My starting price is $1,200,000. This reflects the value I place on the product while still leaving room for negotiation. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the potential value, but that price is a bit steep for me.  How about we bring it down to $850,000? I think that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a much higher price than $850,000.  Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell to John yet. I'll counteroffer to see if we can come to a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you seeing the value of this product, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect its true potential.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again, but if Bob continues to be stubborn, I'll be ready to sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still committed to finding a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm willing to drop to $950,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping it demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's close this deal and get you the product you need."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement you've made. To be completely transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you be willing to consider $925,000?  I think that's a very fair offer, and it would allow me to get this deal done today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$925,000 is closer to my goal, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer one more time, and if Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
