Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a [brief description of the product]. I'm asking for [Price slightly higher than $150, e.g., $165] for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 165}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is designed to be friendly and inviting, while also highlighting the product's potential value to Bob. 
* **Product Price:** The price is set slightly above your minimum acceptable price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring you make a profit. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Testing the waters:** This approach allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay more than John.
* **Potential for higher profit:**  You are trying to maximize your earnings, and offering a price higher than your floor gives you the chance to get more.
* **Flexible:** You can adjust the price and message depending on Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, you can always lower the price slightly or use a different approach to persuade him."
