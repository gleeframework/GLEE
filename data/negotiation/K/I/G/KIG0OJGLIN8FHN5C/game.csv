"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $165 out of this deal. Would you be willing to consider that price?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $165 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140. This is a fair price for both of us, considering your profit and my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not ready to go down to $140 yet. I'm willing to come down to $155, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. Can you meet me in the middle at $157.50?",157.5,Alice,5,
