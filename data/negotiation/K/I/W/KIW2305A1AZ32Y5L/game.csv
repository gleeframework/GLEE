"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1500000 to you, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly beneficial for your business.  I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1200000.  This is a significant discount, but I want to make sure we can both find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I can get from the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1000000 is still quite a bit below what I believe the product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This represents a fair compromise for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking that $950000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975000. I believe this is a reasonable price that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $975000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but I think I can do better than that. My final offer is $995000. I believe this is a fair price for the product and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",995000.0,Bob,6,
