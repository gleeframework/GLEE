Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. Starting with a price higher than his perceived value allows room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out.
* **Negotiation:** The initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. This starts a negotiation process where Alice can potentially still get a price higher than $10,000. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject a price higher than his perceived value outright. However, it's strategically sound to start high and gauge his reaction."
