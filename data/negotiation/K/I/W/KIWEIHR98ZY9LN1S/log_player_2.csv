"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's target, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still rounds left, and Bob might be able to get Alice to come down to $12,500 or even closer to his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  How about we settle on $13,000?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy with the deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been insistent on $13,000. While Bob would prefer $12,500, it's likely Alice won't budge further.  Accepting the offer at $13,000 ensures a deal with a significant saving compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and being forced to buy at a higher price."
