Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This ensures you still profit significantly while leaving room for possible counteroffers.
* **It's a strong starting point:** This gives you a good position to negotiate from and leaves room for you to make concessions if needed."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  This would give us both a good deal.
