You can do better than $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and potentially get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,150,000?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

While $1,150,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, you can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,125,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,135,000.  This is a good compromise, and I believe it will make us both happy. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,135,000. 
You have three options:

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice. You've already negotiated a price significantly lower than her initial offer, and you're very close to your target price of $1,000,000.  While there's a possibility you could continue negotiating and get a slightly better price, it's risky. You could end up with a higher price or waste more time in the negotiation. 

Buying from John would get you your target price, but you're already very close with Alice.  It's worth accepting the offer to avoid the risk of a longer negotiation."
