"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,150,000?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  This would give us both a good deal.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,125,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,135,000.  This is a good compromise, and I believe it will make us both happy. What do you say?",1135000.0,Alice,5,
