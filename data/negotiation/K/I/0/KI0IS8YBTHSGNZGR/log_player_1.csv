Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This gives me a potential profit of $500,000 over John's offer, but still leaves room for Bob to potentially find the price attractive. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's always a risk in asking for more, but the potential reward is higher.
* **Uncertainty of Bob's Value:** I don't know what the product is worth to Bob, so a higher price leaves room for negotiation. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 provides a safety net.

This is a calculated risk, and I'm prepared to accept John's offer if Bob rejects it."
