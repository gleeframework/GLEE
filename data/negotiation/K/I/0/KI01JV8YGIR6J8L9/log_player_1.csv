"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate and still secure a decent profit. I'm also being friendly and giving Bob a reason to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value of $150. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is significantly below what I need to sell this product.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $120?  I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering $120. This is still above my minimum acceptable price but significantly lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but $120 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we try $75? That's a pretty fair offer considering your initial price and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I need to get closer to my desired price to make the deal worthwhile. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $75 simply wouldn't cover my costs.  Let's try $100.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm trying to bridge the gap further by offering $100. This is still above my minimum acceptable value, but it's a significant compromise from my previous offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $100 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. How about we settle at $80? That's my final offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I've already made several compromises, and it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. While it's not the highest price I could potentially get, it's still a profitable deal and ensures I don't lose money on this transaction."
