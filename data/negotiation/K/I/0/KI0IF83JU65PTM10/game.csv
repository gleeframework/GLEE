"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is far too low.  I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly exceptional and worth a significant investment.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value I know you'll receive.  Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. That feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $700,000 is still a bit too far from what this product is worth.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This allows us both to make a good deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this investment. ",850000.0,Alice,5,
