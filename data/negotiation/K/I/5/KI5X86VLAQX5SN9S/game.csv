"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500? ",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $9,250. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,750?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,750 is a compromise, Bob, but I still need to ensure I'm making a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I need to make sure it's a price that works for me. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to stay above $9,000. My next offer is $9,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
