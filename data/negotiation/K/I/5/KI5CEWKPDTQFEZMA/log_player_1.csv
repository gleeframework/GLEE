Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering it at $150,  we signal that we might be open to lowering the price slightly, making Bob feel like they can get a good deal.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer will help us understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is below both our minimum acceptable price ($100) and his own stated value for the product. While we want to maximize profit, accepting this offer would mean a loss. It's worthwhile to negotiate further and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might seem high, but I believe this product offers significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that often feels fair to both parties. It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Above Minimum, Below Bob's Value:** This counteroffer keeps the price above our $100 minimum while staying below Bob's stated value of $100. There's a good chance he'll find this price more reasonable.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** We're not drastically reducing our price, indicating that we're not desperate and still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $120 is still a little high for me though.  I'm willing to go up to $105.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $105 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $100. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that:

* **Bob walks away:** He's already shown he's willing to negotiate, but pushing for more could backfire.
* **We waste time and opportunity:**  Negotiations take time. Accepting this offer allows us to close the deal and move on to other potential sales.

Getting $105 is a win, exceeding our minimum. It's often better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it by being overly aggressive in negotiations."
