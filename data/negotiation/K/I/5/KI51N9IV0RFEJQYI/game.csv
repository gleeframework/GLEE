"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it holds for you.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation.",975000.0,Alice,3,
