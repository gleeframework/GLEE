Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value, and I'm really interested in purchasing it from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This would allow us both to get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for it. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,800 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but I need to make a little more on this.  How about $9,250? It's a fair compromise, and it lets us both get closer to where we want to be."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $9,250, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $9,000? This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better offer.  I believe I can still get a higher price if I push a little harder.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. How about $9,150? This would be a great middle ground, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think I've been too generous. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. I'll meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm still not comfortable selling for $9,000. I've already given up a significant amount of potential profit.  To avoid losing more time and potentially getting stuck at an even lower price, I'm going to sell to John for $12,000.  It's a better deal for me, and it ensures I reach my minimum value."
