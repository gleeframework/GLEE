"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This would allow us both to come away from the negotiation satisfied.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. While $10,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still trying to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference again - I'm willing to go down to $9,875.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's worth considering.",9875.0,Alice,5,
