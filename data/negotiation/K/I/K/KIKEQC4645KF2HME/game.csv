"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true value of this product. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $17,000, which is still a good price for you given the product's value. Let's see if we can make this work.",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $18,500?",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $18,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking to stay within my budget.  I'm happy to offer $17,500, which is a fair price considering the value we both agree on.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $18,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to maximize value, but $18,000 is still above my target.  I'm prepared to offer $17,750, which is a significant compromise on my end.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal at this price.",17750.0,Bob,6,
