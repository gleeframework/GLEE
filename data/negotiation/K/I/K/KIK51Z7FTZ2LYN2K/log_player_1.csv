"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate, but it's still a good price for me. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, which can help build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. How about we split the difference and go with $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit lower on the budget. Would you be willing to go down to $115? I really think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer of $115 is getting close to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than risk ending up with nothing."
