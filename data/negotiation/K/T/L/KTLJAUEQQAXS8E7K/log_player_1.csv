Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a competitive price of $1,100,000. I believe it represents significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,200,000.
* **John's Offer:** John guarantees you $1,200,000 if Bob refuses.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to get Bob to pay as much as possible above his valuation without exceeding his limit.  Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob:

* **Price Justification:**  The $1,100,000 offer is a significant markup from Bob's $800,000 valuation, but it's still a ""discount"" from what John is willing to pay. 
* **Potential for Acceptance:** This price might entice Bob to accept, as he would be getting the product for $100,000 less than your guaranteed sale. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything, as John will purchase it at your desired price.
