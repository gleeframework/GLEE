,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $100 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm thinking of a price of $92. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $92 is still a bit high for me, though.  I'm willing to go up to $88.  What do you say?",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still negotiating! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $88 and $92. How about we try $90.5? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",90.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still aiming for a bit lower than $90.50. How about we settle on $89.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",89.5,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $89.50. I'm thinking of a price of $91. I know we're close, but I think this is a great price for the product. What do you think?",91.0,Alice,9,
