Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's potential, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its current market value and my potential use for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while being realistic for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still quite interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little too high for me. How about we settle at $1,150,000?  This demonstrates my strong interest while acknowledging the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
