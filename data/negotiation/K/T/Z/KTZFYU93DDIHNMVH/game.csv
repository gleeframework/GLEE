"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $12,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,500. How about $12,250? That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider my offer?",12250.0,Bob,4,
