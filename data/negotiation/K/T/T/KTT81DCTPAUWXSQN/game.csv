"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $950,000?  That's a significant investment on my part, but I'm confident in the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to make a significant investment, but I'm not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $1,100,000 is the minimum I can accept.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,150,000.
