"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I propose an initial price of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to propose $1,250,000 as a starting point for our negotiation.  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to move a bit from my initial offer. How about we settle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
