"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $500,000 to make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for your business. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. While I believe this product could be beneficial,  I need a price that aligns with my budget. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below the product's value to me and what John is offering. It's important to demonstrate I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we both see the value in this product, but we need to bridge the price gap. To demonstrate my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, we need to find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but he's still significantly below my minimum and John's guaranteed offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see a more substantial jump from Bob to indicate he's serious."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the current price gap remains substantial.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer represents a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Concession:**  While I'm sticking to my guns above John's offer, I'm making another substantial drop in my asking price. This shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating but won't go below a certain threshold. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We're getting closer to the end of the rounds. This offer might push Bob to make a more serious offer as the guaranteed option of John becomes more appealing to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product represents significant value, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:**  Bob's offer increments are very small, and he's still extremely far from my minimum acceptable price. This latest offer indicates he's unlikely to significantly increase his valuation.
* **Guaranteed Value:** John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a high risk of ending up with a much lower offer, even if Bob slightly increases his offer over the next two rounds.
* **Time Value:**  Every round spent on Bob is an opportunity cost against finalizing the deal with John. 

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on to the guaranteed sale."
