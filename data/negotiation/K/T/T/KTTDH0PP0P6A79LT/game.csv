"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $500,000 to make it work.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for your business. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. While I believe this product could be beneficial,  I need a price that aligns with my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we both see the value in this product, but we need to bridge the price gap. To demonstrate my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000. This is a substantial reduction, reflecting my understanding of your budget concerns while still acknowledging the significant value this product brings.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, we need to find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000 for the product?",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the current price gap remains substantial.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer represents a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product represents significant value, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,8,
