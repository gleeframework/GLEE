"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. That's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $12,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further, getting you a better deal."
