"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. Could you meet me halfway at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $10,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,300.  Would that work for you?",9300.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you drive a hard bargain! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,650?",9650.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right, we're close! How about we settle right in the middle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,6,
