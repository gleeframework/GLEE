"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $9000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11000. This is the best price I can offer at this point.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $9500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of it.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to go below $10500. This is the lowest price I can accept for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $10500. This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
