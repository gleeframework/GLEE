"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer,  $9,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm hoping we can agree on $11,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value you've mentioned. Let's try to find a compromise!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $10,500 is a little too low for me. How about $11,250?  That's a good compromise, and it brings us closer to a deal. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us!",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. But $10,750 is just too low for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you've mentioned, and it brings us closer to an agreement. Let's try to make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10800.0,Bob,8,
