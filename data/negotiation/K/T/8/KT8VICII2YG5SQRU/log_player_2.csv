# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product that will meet your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $13,750. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $13,500, which is my absolute lowest price. This is a good compromise considering the product's value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down to her previous offer and called it her ""absolute lowest price.""  While there's a chance she could be bluffing, it's risky to push further. Accepting the $13,500 offer secures a decent price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
