"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I can sell the product to John for the same price without further negotiation. It makes more sense to sell to John and avoid the risk of Bob not reaching my desired price in subsequent rounds."
