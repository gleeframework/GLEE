"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is still a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get a significant discount. What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
