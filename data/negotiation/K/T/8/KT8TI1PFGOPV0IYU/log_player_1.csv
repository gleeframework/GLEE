{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate. It's also below what the product is worth to Bob, so there's an incentive for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $10,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,750. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is only $300 below my last counteroffer, and it's still significantly above my minimum price of $8,000. At this point, it's not worth risking losing the sale and ending up with the lower offer from John. I'll accept Bob's offer."
