Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but unfortunately, $1200000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and my need to stay within budget.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
