"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to move a bit on price, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position. Let's make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.  What do you say?",980000.0,Alice,5,
