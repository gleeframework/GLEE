"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I can afford. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is my final offer. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I can do $13,500. That's my best and final offer... for now.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. However, I can't go above $11,500. This is a significant amount of money for me, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about this. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $12,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a tough pill to swallow, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. This is my final concession. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,9,
