"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity. I'm willing to start at a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I can afford. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, he can likely still negotiate a better price.  He's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000, and there's still room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I can do $13,500. That's my best and final offer... for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,500 is tempting, he's still above his comfort zone. He has a fallback option with John, and there's still room to negotiate with Alice.  There are a few rounds remaining, so he should continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. However, I can't go above $11,500. This is a significant amount of money for me, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about this. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is getting closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price. He has a fallback option with John, and he should continue to try and negotiate a lower price. There are only a few rounds remaining, but there's still time to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $12,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a tough pill to swallow, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. This is my final concession. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While $12,500 is a better price than previous offers, it's still more than Bob's ideal budget of $10,000. 
* **Only one round left:** With only one round remaining, there's little chance Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, which is a guaranteed deal for Bob.

By choosing to buy from John, Bob gets the product for his ideal price and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not be successful."
