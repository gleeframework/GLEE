{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum value of $10,000 and the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $9,500 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value of $10,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do at this time."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
``` 
I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum value but still lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm on getting a price that's fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. Would you be willing to consider $10,000 as a final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value. While I would prefer to make a profit, accepting his offer guarantees me the $10,000 I need. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price, and selling to John would be the same outcome."
