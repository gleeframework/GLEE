"Alice, $2500000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1750000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1750000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again, and offer $1250000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1600000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $1600000 is still higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $1350000. This is a significant offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I hope you'll accept this offer.",1350000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1350000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1550000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product and my budget.  Let's reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
