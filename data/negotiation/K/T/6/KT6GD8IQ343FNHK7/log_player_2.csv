"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product.  Alice is offering it for $115. While this is a good deal, you can do slightly better. If you reject Alice's offer, you can buy it from John for $120.  Since your maximum is $120, rejecting Alice's offer will save you $5."
