"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a one-time price of $1,200,000. This is a limited time offer, and I'm confident that you'll see the immense value it brings. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $1,200,000 is more than what Alice values the product for, it's significantly less than your maximum budget ($1,500,000) and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $300,000."
