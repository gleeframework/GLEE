"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range that might tempt him, given his potential profit. 
* **Building a Relationship:**  The message is friendly and aims to establish a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's room for both of us to come down in price during the remaining rounds. 
* **Protecting My Value:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving away the product for less than my minimum value. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for better deal:** I have nine more rounds to negotiate with Bob. There's a possibility we can reach a price closer to my goal.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer because I know I have a guaranteed alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1,200,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still gives you a significant opportunity for profit.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** I'm lowering my price, showing flexibility, but not caving in completely.  $1,600,000 is still above my minimum.
* **Highlighting potential value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the potential profit he could still make at this price. 
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and collaborative approach can help keep the negotiation open. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** I'm leaving space for Bob to counter, allowing us to move towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,300,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I still have six rounds left to negotiate with Bob. With each round, we are getting closer to a potential deal.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I am not in a rush to accept a sub-optimal offer because I have a guaranteed alternative with John.

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to move the price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Would you consider $1,450,000? It's a good price for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away with a positive outcome."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising Further:** I'm continuing to lower my price, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still protecting my minimum value.
* **""Meeting Halfway"":** This language is designed to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to see this as a good compromise. 
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this price allows both of us to achieve a positive result. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  By making a counteroffer instead of accepting his offer, I maintain leverage and potentially bring Bob closer to my target price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. This is still a good price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I have four rounds left to negotiate with Bob. There's still a good chance we can reach a price closer to my goal.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I am not in a rush to accept a sub-optimal offer because I have a guaranteed alternative with John.

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to move the price closer to my desired range."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference once more. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to get this valuable product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Compromise:** I'm still lowering my price, demonstrating a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **""Split the Difference"":** This language appeals to Bob's sense of fairness and encourages him to see this as a reasonable compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I remind Bob of the value of the product, making it clear that this offer is still a good deal for him.
* **Time Pressure:** We are nearing the halfway point in negotiations, so I'm subtly increasing the pressure to reach a deal. 
* **Protecting My Minimum:** While I'm willing to negotiate further, $1,400,000 is still close to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that we're close, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you at $1,380,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the pressure to close a deal is increasing.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $1,380,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **John's offer is a guarantee:**  I am not confident that I can secure a price closer to my target in the remaining rounds. John's offer provides a safe and guaranteed alternative that meets my minimum value. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed deal with John than to risk a lower price with Bob in the remaining rounds."
