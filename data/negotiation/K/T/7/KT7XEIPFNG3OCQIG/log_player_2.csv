Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $790,000 is very close to my minimum, but I'm only willing to go down to $800,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

At this point, Alice has met your price limit.  There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and continuing the negotiation might lead to her retracting the offer.  It's best to accept and secure the deal at your target price."
