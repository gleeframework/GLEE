"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to go up to $12,500.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,200. It's close to your offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",15200.0,Alice,5,
