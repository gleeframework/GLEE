"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $115.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised a bit by meeting you halfway at $130. I'm willing to make another small adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. How about we try $125? It's a fair price that's closer to your target, and I think you'll still find it's a great value.",125.0,Alice,5,
