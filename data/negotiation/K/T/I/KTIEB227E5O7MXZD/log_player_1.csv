"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($100) but below my minimum ($150). This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and hopefully make Bob more open to negotiating. 
* **Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm aware that Bob might counteroffer, and I want to leave enough room to adjust the price in later rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a price that doesn't at least cover my minimum. 
* **Time on My Side:**  I have 8 rounds left, which gives me enough time to continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $145? Let's get this done! "", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price, but I'm also making it clear that my minimum is $150. This counteroffer represents a compromise that's closer to my desired price.
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation friendly and avoid any sense of hostility.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a touch of urgency with ""Let's get this done!"" to suggest that I'm willing to close the deal but won't wait forever."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum.
* **Time to Push:** I have 6 rounds remaining. I'm going to push for a slightly higher price, but I'll be ready to accept John's offer if Bob continues to be unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $130 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $140. What do you say? "", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continued Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. 
* **Clear Signal:**  This counteroffer signals that I'm serious about closing a deal but won't accept a price too far below my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone, hoping to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $135 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and I'm starting to run out of time.
* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I know John is willing to pay my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing that deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with John, who is willing to pay my minimum and eliminate the risk of further negotiation."
