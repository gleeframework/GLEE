# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $180. I think it's a fair price considering its quality and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
