"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price of $1,700,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, which is far greater than the price I'm offering.  While I'm confident in the product's worth, I understand it may not be the right fit for everyone. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is eager to pay its full value.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
