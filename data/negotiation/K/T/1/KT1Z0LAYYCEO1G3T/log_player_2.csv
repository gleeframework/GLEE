"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is better than $15,000, you can still get the product for less than $12,000 by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $12,500. This is a significant discount from her initial offer of $14,000 and is within my budget of $12,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially get a better deal than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is still within my budget and represents a good deal compared to the initial offer of $14,000.  It's also a good compromise considering I offered $12,500.  While I could continue negotiating, there is a risk that Alice will reject further offers and I might end up having to buy from John for $12,000."
