"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $800000 feels a bit high for me at this stage. I'm willing to offer $500000, which is a significant starting point for negotiations.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $700000 is still a bit steep. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $600000. This is a fair price considering the potential value of the product, and it allows us both to find a mutually beneficial outcome.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll offer it to you for $650000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
