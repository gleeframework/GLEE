Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $800,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $800000 feels a bit high for me at this stage. I'm willing to offer $500000, which is a significant starting point for negotiations.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $500,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $700000 is still a bit steep. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $600000. This is a fair price considering the potential value of the product, and it allows us both to find a mutually beneficial outcome.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000.

This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 650000}"
