"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While it's a nice product, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my own investment in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,500 for it. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $13,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to get at least $13,000 for it. How about we meet at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need that price to come down just a bit more. Would you be willing to do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $11,500, so I'll offer it to you for $12,250. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",12250.0,Alice,7,
