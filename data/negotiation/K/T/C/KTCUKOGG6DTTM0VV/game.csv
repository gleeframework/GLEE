"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $2,000,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,700,000.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me. Could we settle at $1,400,000? That would make this a viable option for me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is as close to my minimum as I can go.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really pushing me to the limit here.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but that's absolutely my final offer.  If we can't agree on that, I'll have to explore other options.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
