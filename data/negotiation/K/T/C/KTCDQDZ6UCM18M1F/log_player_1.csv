Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to make you a great deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see this as a good opportunity and make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I have 9 rounds remaining, so there's still time to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

While $1,175,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit too low. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I have 6 rounds remaining and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  How about we compromise at $1,200,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While we're getting closer, $1,185,000 is still far from my minimum acceptable price. I have 4 rounds remaining and I'm confident that I can get a better deal. I need to be patient and continue to negotiate."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,185,000 still isn't close to what I need for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,192,500.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting down to the wire.  I'm willing to offer $1,190,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my limit.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I have only two rounds remaining.  I'm not confident that I can get a better deal with Bob, and I don't want to risk losing a sale entirely. It's better to secure the sale with John at $1,500,000."
