"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to make you a great deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  How about we compromise at $1,200,000? This would be a significant saving for you, and it would allow me to move closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,185,000.  I'm hoping we can finalize this soon.",1185000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,185,000 still isn't close to what I need for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,192,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1192500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting down to the wire.  I'm willing to offer $1,190,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my limit.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",1190000.0,Bob,8,
