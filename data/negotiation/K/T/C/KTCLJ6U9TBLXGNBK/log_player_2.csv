"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is already a very competitive price considering the value this product brings.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer. Bob has already made his counteroffer, and it's likely Alice won't go lower.  While Bob could try for another counteroffer, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting the offer at $1,100,000 saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John, and it's a good price for the value of the product."
