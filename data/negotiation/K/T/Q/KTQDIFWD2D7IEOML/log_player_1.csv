Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts.  He saves $100,000 from his perceived value, and I earn a significant profit above my minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product."
