,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I think this product might be great, $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to do $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $175.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $175 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $137.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $162.50. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",162.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $162.50 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $150?  I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,6,
