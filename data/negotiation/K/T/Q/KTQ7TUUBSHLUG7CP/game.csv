"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $17,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15,500, which is as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet at this price.",15500.0,Bob,4,
