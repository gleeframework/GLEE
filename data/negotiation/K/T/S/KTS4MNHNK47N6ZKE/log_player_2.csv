"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, it's best to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's perceived value of the product ($10,000). This shows I'm serious about buying but also gives room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm willing to compromise.  However, it's still below Alice's latest offer, demonstrating my commitment to negotiating a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is close to my target price, and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer again, potentially forcing me to buy from John at a higher price."
