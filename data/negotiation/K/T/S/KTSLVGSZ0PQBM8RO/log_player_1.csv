# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a price that's more in line with my budget. I'd like to offer $1200000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
