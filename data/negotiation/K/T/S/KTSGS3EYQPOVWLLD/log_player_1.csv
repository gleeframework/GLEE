This offer sets a high starting point, knowing that I can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my counteroffer based on his response and how determined he seems to be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still holding out for more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still confident in the value of the product. This counteroffer shows I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not willing to settle for much less than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price and it's getting late in the negotiation. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price I'm happy with, and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or even a failed sale."
