Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that amount as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $750,000}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also leaving some room for him to make a counteroffer. Let's see how he responds!"
