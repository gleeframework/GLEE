I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd be willing to sell to John.  This gives me some room to negotiate with Bob. I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000, but I'm willing to go lower if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still below it. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping I can get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum.  I'm hoping to get closer to a deal with Bob while still making a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm confident I can get a better price from John. It's better to secure a sale at a reasonable price than to risk getting stuck in a long negotiation."
