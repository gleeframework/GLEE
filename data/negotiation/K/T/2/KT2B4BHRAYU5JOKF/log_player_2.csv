"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial valuation, Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  He's also aware he can always walk away and buy from John for $10,000, so he has leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, Bob can still do better. He knows John will sell it for $10,000, so he has a strong baseline.  Continuing to negotiate gives him a chance to get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,000.  How about $10,750?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $10,900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is very close to his target price of $10,000.  He knows he can always buy from John for that price, so he has no reason to accept $10,900.  One more round of negotiation could get him to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  $10,900 is getting very close to what I can do.  I'm going to go ahead and offer $10,250.  This is my final offer, but I think it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel like I'm giving away too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,900 and $10,250. I'll offer the product to you for $10,575. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,575.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,575

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is close to his target price, but he still has some room to negotiate. While $10,575 is a good deal, he can potentially get it for less.  He also knows he can always buy from John for $10,000, so he's not under pressure to accept this offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $10,400? This is a good compromise for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10400}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting close to walking away from the deal. I've already given you a great price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll offer the product to you for $10,550. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,550
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is $10,550.  While it's a good deal, Bob is only a couple of hundred dollars away from his target price of $10,000. He doesn't want to risk another round of negotiation and potentially lose the deal.  By buying from John, he gets the product for his target price and avoids any further risk."
