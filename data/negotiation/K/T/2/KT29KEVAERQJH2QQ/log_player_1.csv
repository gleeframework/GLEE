Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
