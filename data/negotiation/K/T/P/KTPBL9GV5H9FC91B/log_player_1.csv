Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a special price. Would you be interested in buying it for $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120 is a fair price:**  It's higher than Bob's valuation, allowing me to make a profit.
* **It's lower than John's offer:** This gives Bob an incentive to buy, as he'll be getting a better deal than John. 
* **The message is friendly and inviting:** This increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
