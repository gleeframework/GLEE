"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than $150, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $130 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $140 but still above her minimum acceptable price of $120.  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also willing to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's a lower price than her initial offer but still higher than Bob's counteroffer.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price that's within his budget and significantly better than buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk of losing the deal entirely, as the negotiations could drag on and Bob might run out of rounds."
