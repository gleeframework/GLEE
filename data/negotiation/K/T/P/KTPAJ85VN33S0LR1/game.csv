"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price for both of us, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the initial offer I made. Let's meet in the middle again and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
