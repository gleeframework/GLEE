"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a decent discount from his perceived value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is still lower than my initial offer, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering $9,500.  This is a small increase from Bob's offer but it shows I'm willing to compromise, while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering it's close to my desired price, and we're already on Round 4. I don't want to risk losing the sale to John or going through many more rounds of negotiation."
