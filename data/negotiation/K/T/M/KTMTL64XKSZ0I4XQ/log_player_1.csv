Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, there's always a chance to get more. Starting with a higher price gives you room to negotiate. 
* **Gauge Interest:** Bob's response to this initial price will give you insight into how much he values the product and his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always lower the price or simply move on to John, ensuring you get your minimum desired price."
