Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd sell to John, hoping to get closer to my desired value.  I'm aware Bob only values the product at $80, but I'm hoping to use the negotiation process to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$120 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum value. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $130 is still above my minimum and it's likely that Bob won't go any higher.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a sale to John at a lower price."
