"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first as I believe you could really benefit from it. I'm asking for $20,000. Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,000. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  $12,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle on $14,000 and call it a deal?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $13,000.  If you're serious about selling, let's make this happen.",13000.0,Bob,6,
