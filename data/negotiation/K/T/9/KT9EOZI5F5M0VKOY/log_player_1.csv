Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you see the value in.  To make this a worthwhile transaction for me, I'm offering it to you at $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much as possible from the sale. Knowing Bob's valuation is $1,000,000, offering it slightly above that leaves room for negotiation but still aims high.
* **John as a Backup:** The guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000 provides a strong fallback position. This allows for a more aggressive offer to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The $1,100,000 price point creates a potential win-win.  Bob could save $100,000 compared to his perceived value, while Alice would still earn $100,000 more than selling to John."
