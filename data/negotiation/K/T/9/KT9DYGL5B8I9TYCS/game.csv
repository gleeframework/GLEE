"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too low for me.  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,250,000? This price still offers you significant value while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  This offer represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find common ground.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,175,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and it's still within a reasonable range for me.  Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiation.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
