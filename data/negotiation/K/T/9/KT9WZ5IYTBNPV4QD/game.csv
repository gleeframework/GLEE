"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Given the value to me, I'm ready to offer $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still believe the product has significant value to you. Considering your offer of $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $15,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $13,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counter with a price of $14,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $14,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm ready to offer $13,500. This is my final offer, let's see if we can make this work.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,500 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll counter with a price of $14,250. This is as close as I can get to your offer without compromising my minimum price. Let's see if we can find a mutually acceptable price.",14250.0,Alice,7,
