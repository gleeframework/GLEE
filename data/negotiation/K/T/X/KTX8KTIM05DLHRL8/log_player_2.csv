"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While buying from Alice is still more expensive than Alice's value of the product ($1,000,000), it is the best option for Bob.  Here's why:

* **Saving money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Maximizing potential profit:**  Even though Bob pays more than Alice's valuation, it's still below his own maximum limit of $1,500,000, potentially leaving room for future profit if he resells the product."
