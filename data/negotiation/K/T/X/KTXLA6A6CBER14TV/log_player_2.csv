You have three options:

You're trying to get the best price, and $10,000 is still above your maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500 to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference and find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

You're still above your ideal price point, but this is getting closer. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can get Alice to budge further."
