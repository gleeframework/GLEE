{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth much more to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum:**  I'm ensuring I make a good profit, well above my minimum of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** I'm leaving room for negotiation, making it more likely Bob will accept or counteroffer. 
* **It shows confidence:** I'm not starting low, suggesting I believe in the product's value. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth, and what I'd like to earn.  

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a middle ground.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is too low for me.  It's important to remember the value this product brings to you.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Here's why I chose this counteroffer:

* **Middle Ground:** $1,100,000 is halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Profitable:**  It's significantly higher than my minimum, ensuring a good profit.
* **Reiterates Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, subtly putting pressure on him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000.  While that's closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a little more room for compromise.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is a very fair price that balances both of our needs.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more and that I can negotiate a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 still doesn't reflect the true value this product holds for you. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  I'll accept $1,050,000. This is a final offer,  and I believe it's a reasonable price that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Final Offer:** I'm stating this is my last offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Middle Ground Again:** It's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer, showing continued willingness to compromise.
* **Slight Concessions:**  While it's lower than my previous offer, it's still above my minimum and secures a decent profit.

Let's see if this time Bob is ready to make a deal."
