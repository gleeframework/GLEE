"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth much more to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price you're willing to pay from John. There's room for negotiation, and you should try to get a better price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is too low for me.  It's important to remember the value this product brings to you.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still too high for me. I can still try to negotiate a lower price. $1,100,000 is closer to my target, but I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 still doesn't reflect the true value this product holds for you. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  I'll accept $1,050,000. This is a final offer,  and I believe it's a reasonable price that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for me. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still within my budget. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's time to accept the offer and finalize the deal."
