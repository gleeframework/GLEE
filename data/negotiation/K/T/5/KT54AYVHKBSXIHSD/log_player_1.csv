I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a high price, but I'm hoping to get the best possible deal. If he rejects, I can always sell to John for the same price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell for significantly less than my minimum price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,000, which is still a good profit for me.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay this price."
