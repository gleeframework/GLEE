"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'd be willing to buy the product for $850,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling point.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for the value you'll get.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $950,000 to $900,000, but it's still above my desired price. I believe I can continue negotiating and get a better deal.  Rejecting allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a bit more of a discount. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $887,500? This is a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away with a good deal. Let's make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is getting closer to my desired price point, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  At this price, I can save a significant amount compared to buying from John.  While I might be able to get a slightly lower price with more negotiation, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $1,000,000 outweighs the potential for a small additional discount.  Accepting this offer is the best option at this point in the negotiation."
