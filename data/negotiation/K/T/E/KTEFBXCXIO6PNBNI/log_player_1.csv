Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,000."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to the product's value to you ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $8,000. 
* **John as Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John if Bob declines. 

Offering the product at $11,000 creates a potential win-win:

* **Bob's Perspective:** He gets the product for $3,000 less than his perceived value.
* **Your Perspective:** You make $1,000 more than selling to John.

By starting high, you leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. The guaranteed sale to John gives you leverage."
