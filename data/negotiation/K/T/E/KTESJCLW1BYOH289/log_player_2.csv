Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $15,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

While $12,000 is closer to my target, it's still too high. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a better compromise."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $10,000.  How about $11,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

While $11,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit too high. I have several rounds left, so I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice. I'm hoping to close the deal for closer to $10,000."
