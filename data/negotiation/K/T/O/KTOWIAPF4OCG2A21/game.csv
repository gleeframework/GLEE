"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit too high for me. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112.50. This is a fair price, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen!",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105. This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $110, which is still a good deal for both of us.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us to finally close this deal.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,7,
