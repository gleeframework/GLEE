"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $9,750? It's a fair offer considering we're both making a concession.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we try $10,250? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come up a bit to $10,000.  That's a fair deal as it's exactly what you value the product at.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. How about we try $10,100? It's a small concession, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",10100.0,Alice,7,
