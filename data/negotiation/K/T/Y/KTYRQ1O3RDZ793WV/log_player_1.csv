Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $9,500."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's valuation leaves space for potential counter-offers while ensuring a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. Offering it to Bob for $9,500 aims to capitalize on Bob's higher perceived value."
