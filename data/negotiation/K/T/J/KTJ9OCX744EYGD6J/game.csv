"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $700,000 is still a bit below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $775,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a great investment for you. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
