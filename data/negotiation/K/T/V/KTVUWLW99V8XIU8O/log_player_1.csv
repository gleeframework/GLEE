"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's not even close to my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm dropping my price to $120, which is still above my minimum value but significantly closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low. While I'm running out of time, I'm not going to settle for such a low price. I'm hoping to get a better offer from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm dropping my price again to $100. This is a significant concession, but I'm still hoping Bob will meet me halfway. I'm also aware that time is running out, and I want to avoid selling to John for $150 if I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While Bob is getting closer, $80 is still far from what I consider a fair deal. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $90. This is a compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer to avoid losing too much money."
