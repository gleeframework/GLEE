"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $160. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it!",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $160 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $145? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $145 is still a little too high for me.  How about we settle on $140? That seems like a fair compromise.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $150 to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $142? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but it's a fair compromise.",142.0,Alice,5,
