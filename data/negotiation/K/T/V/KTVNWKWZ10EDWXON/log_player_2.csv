"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above your maximum price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $1,075,000 is still above your maximum. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can reach a deal at $1,000,000 or slightly above."

I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $1,075,000, which is the same price I offered in the previous round. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stuck to her price of $1,075,000, which is still above my maximum.  It seems like further negotiation won't be successful.  It's more advantageous to buy from John for $1,000,000, saving me $75,000."
