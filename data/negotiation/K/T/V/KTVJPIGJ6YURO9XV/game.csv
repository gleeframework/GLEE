"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $95.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $110. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in the negotiation process. I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, I need to make a living, so I'm willing to compromise again. I can offer you the product for $115. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",115.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see you're willing to meet me at $110, but I'm not quite ready to accept that yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $115, which would be $112.50. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your continued effort in negotiation, Alice. Based on our previous discussions and considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product.",110.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit repetitive here. I've already offered you $112.50, and you're coming back to $110. I'm not willing to go back and forth on the same price. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50 one more time, but if you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer, and I'm not budging from this price.",112.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I am unable to agree to a price higher than $110. I hope we can find a mutually acceptable solution soon.",110.0,Bob,10,
