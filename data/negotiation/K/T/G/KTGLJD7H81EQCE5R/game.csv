"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. It's a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $750,000.  However, I'm still a bit higher than my target.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $725,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'll offer you $750,000 again, but this time, I'll throw in some additional features and support that will make the product even more valuable to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,
