"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get a good price and I'll get a fair return on my investment.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than John's price of $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's initial offer and counter-offering.  Alice is willing to sell for $10,000, so there's room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $11000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a better return on my investment. What do you say?

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than John's price of $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is willing to sell for $10,000, so Bob can try to get closer to that price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $10750 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10875? It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While he'd ideally prefer a lower price,  $10,875 is still a good deal compared to John's price of $12,000 and is getting closer to Alice's bottom line of $10,000. It's a fair compromise, and Bob can likely secure the product at a price he's comfortable with. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher cost."
