"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get a good price and I'll get a fair return on my investment.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11500 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  Would you consider $10500?  That's still a good profit for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $11000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a better return on my investment. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $10750?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $10750 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10875? It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price. What do you think?",10875.0,Alice,5,
