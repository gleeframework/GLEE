{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get a good price and I'll get a fair return on my investment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not selling below your minimum value of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** You're leaving room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $12,000. 
* **It's a reasonable compromise:**  The offer is fair and should encourage Bob to negotiate further.

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response. You also have the option of selling to John at any time, but hopefully, you can get a better price from Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11500 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  Would you consider $10500?  That's still a good profit for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still a bit lower than your desired price. It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your $11,500 target through counter-offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a better return on my investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I've lowered my offer to $11,000, which is still above your minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still holding out for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $10750?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,750 is closer to your minimum, it's still worth trying to squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  You are still in a good position as Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown willingness to negotiate. You can potentially get a better price with one more counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,750 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,875? It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10875}
```

This offer represents a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and your previous one. It shows flexibility and willingness to close the deal."
