Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $1,000,000 if Bob declines.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price enticing enough for Bob to accept, while maximizing your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed $1,000,000 backup, you can be a bit bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to someone like you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,350,000 is significantly more than your minimum and leaves you with a substantial profit margin.
* **Appeals to Bob's Value:** The message highlights the ""unique value"" and targets Bob's higher perceived worth. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While a strong initial offer, it leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down slightly if he chooses, keeping you above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a deal with Bob, you could adjust the price accordingly."
