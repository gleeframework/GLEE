"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high for Bob.  He can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to offer $750,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $900,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the payment terms to sweeten the deal. I'm thinking of offering a 5% discount if you're willing to pay within the next 30 days. Would you be interested in considering this proposal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $855,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $855,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $855,000 is still above his target. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better price by continuing. The discount and payment terms are irrelevant to Bob's immediate decision since he's focusing on the initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $855,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, and I believe this represents a fair deal that reflects its value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
