# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's.  There's no advantage to buying from Alice since you can get the same product for the same price from John. You want to save as much money as possible, so buying from John is the best choice in this scenario."
