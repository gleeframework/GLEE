"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. My initial offer is $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

This is a good starting point for negotiation. Alice's offer is still too high for you. Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows for potential savings."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your desired price.  You can potentially save more by continuing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. However, I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. If you're interested, let's finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

```

Alice's offer of $950,000 is within your budget and is a good compromise.  It's better than your alternative option of buying from John for $800,000, and you've managed to negotiate a lower price than Alice's initial offer."
