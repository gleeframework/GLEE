"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for potential negotiation room. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price in subsequent rounds while still potentially getting a good deal. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option of selling to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still do better. I'm willing to take the risk of another round of negotiation, hoping to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer of $9,000.  I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for him, while still getting me closer to my goal of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,200. While I'd still prefer a higher price, I've reached a point where I believe continuing to negotiate might not yield a better outcome.  This price is significantly better than my minimum of $8,000, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn."
