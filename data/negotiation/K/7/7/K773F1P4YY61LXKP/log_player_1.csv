{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,750. This is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this shows flexibility while still pushing for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer, but it's still higher than my guaranteed sale to John. I'm going to accept his offer to secure a sale at a reasonable price."
