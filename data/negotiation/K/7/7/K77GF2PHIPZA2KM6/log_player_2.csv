Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss $130? I think that's a fair price for a great product like this.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $125? I think that's the lowest I can go and still make this deal worthwhile for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is holding firm, and while $125 isn't a terrible price, we know we can get it for $120 from John.  It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation with Alice.  Let's go with John."
