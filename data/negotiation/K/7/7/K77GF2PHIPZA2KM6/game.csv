"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss $130? I think that's a fair price for a great product like this.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you be willing to consider $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $125? I think that's the lowest I can go and still make this deal worthwhile for me.",125.0,Alice,5,
