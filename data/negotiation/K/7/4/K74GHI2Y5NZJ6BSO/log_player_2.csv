"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price that's significantly below its true value to me. While I value it at over $1.5 million, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial savings for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you. Consider this a chance to secure a valuable asset at a very attractive price. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
