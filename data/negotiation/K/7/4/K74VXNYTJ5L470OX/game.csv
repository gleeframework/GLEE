"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get your hands on this incredible item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to pay that price for this product.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $8200. It's still a great deal considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $8200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7800 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8200 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $8000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8000, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to save a bit more, Bob. However, I've already gone as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not willing to go below $7800. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $7800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7200 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",7200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $7500. I've already compromised a lot, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at $7500, I'm not sure I'm willing to continue negotiating. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go with $7000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",7000.0,Bob,10,
