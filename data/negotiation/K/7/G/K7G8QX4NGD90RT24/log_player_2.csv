"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price from Alice. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and encourage her to lower the price."
