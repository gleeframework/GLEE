"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Even though it's not the absolute lowest price, it saves you $100,000 compared to John's offer. 
* **Your goal is to save money.**  While you could potentially negotiate with Alice, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
