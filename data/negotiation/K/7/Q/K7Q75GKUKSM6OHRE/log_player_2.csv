"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high quality and unique features, I believe it's truly worth more than its actual cost. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $100. This allows us both to benefit - you get a great deal on an item you value at $120, while I secure a profit that reflects the product's worth. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her making a lower counter-offer, bringing you closer to the seller's value of $80."
