"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high quality and unique features, I believe it's truly worth more than its actual cost. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $100. This allows us both to benefit - you get a great deal on an item you value at $120, while I secure a profit that reflects the product's worth. I look forward to your response.",100.0,Alice,1,
