"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this unique item. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $8000 for the product. Would it be possible for you to adjust your price accordingly?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, my budget remains at $8000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8500 if that might be within your consideration. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our positions.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9250. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this unique item. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $9250 is closer to my budget, I still cannot exceed $8000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $8750. This is the highest I can go, and I hope it's within your consideration. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise given the value of the product.",8750.0,Bob,6,
