Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you're in a strong position to aim high with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob and its exclusivity can justify a premium price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and scarcity.

While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, the potential reward of an extra $500,000 makes it a calculated risk worth taking. If Bob rejects the offer, you still have your guaranteed sale to John at your minimum acceptable price."
