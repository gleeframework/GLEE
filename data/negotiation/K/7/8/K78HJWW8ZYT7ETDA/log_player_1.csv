{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so he's likely to consider this offer.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to accept no less than $12,000, so you have room to negotiate down.
* **It shows you're open to a deal:**  By offering a price and including a friendly message, you're indicating your willingness to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a nice product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **You have a better option:** John is willing to pay your minimum, so selling to him guarantees you a higher price.
* **Negotiating further might be time-consuming:** There's no guarantee that you'll be able to convince Bob to increase his offer significantly. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you are positioning yourself to secure the best possible price for your product."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
