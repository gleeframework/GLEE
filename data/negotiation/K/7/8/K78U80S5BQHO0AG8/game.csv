"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about $95? I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Can you consider this offer?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. Let's split the difference and go with $93.75. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",93.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $93.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",92.0,Bob,6,
