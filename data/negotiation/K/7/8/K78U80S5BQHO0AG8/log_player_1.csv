"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows me to potentially secure a higher price while also encouraging Bob to participate in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to sell just yet. I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about $95? I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $92.5 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round, but if Bob doesn't budge I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. Let's split the difference and go with $93.75. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 93.75} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $93.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a significantly better price from Bob.  He's not willing to budge much further, and I'm only a few rounds away from having to accept his offer, which is close to my minimum but still below what I'd like to get. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, ensuring a profit of $120."
