"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,400,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1,250,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're willing to pay.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm counteroffering at $1,320,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
