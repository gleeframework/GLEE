"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $1,700,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows me to meet my minimum requirements.  Let's make this happen!",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,400,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that reflects both our interests and allows us to close the deal.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced that $1,400,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and the value I can get out of it.",1350000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $1,450,000, but I can't go any lower.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,7,
