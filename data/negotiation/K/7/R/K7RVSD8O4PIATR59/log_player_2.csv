"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price. You have room to bargain since your maximum price is $120 and Alice's minimum price is $100."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still better off trying to negotiate further. You can potentially get a lower price from Alice, and you have some rounds left before resorting to buying from John."

Round 5

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer of $112.5 is a good deal. It's within your budget and getting closer to her minimum price.  Continuing to negotiate might save you a few more dollars, but it risks you having to buy from John at a higher price."
