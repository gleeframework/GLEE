Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the significant value it holds for you. "",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Considering the Alternative:** We know we have John as a backup who will pay our minimum acceptable price ($800,000), so we can be a bit bolder with Bob.

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, Alice increases her chances of securing a higher sale price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
