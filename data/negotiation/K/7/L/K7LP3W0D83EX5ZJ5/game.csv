"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit above my initial budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1000000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1050000? This would be a significant saving for me and still allows for a fair profit for you.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $1050000. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1080000. This is a good balance between your budget and the value the product brings. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
