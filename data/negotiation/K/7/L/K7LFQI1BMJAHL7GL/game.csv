"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you showing me the product.  While I'm interested,  $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $900000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1050000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we've discussed.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still not willing to meet me at $1050000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1020000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1020000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $975000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're still trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $1015000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. I'm getting closer to my target, but $1015000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $990000.  If we can meet in the middle, I think we can make this deal work.",990000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand you're getting close to your target, but I'm not willing to give up on the value of the product just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $1007500. This is my final concession, and I think it's a great compromise.",1007500.0,Alice,9,
