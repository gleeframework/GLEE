"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial price.  However, $11,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested.",10800.0,Alice,3,
