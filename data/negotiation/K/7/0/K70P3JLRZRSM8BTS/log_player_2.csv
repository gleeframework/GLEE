"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial price.  However, $11,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is lower than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and Bob would be forced to buy from John at $10,000.  Accepting Alice's offer is the safest and most cost-effective option."
