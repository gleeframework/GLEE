"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  $6,000 is a bit too low for me. How about $8,500? That would give us both a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $8,500 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it's closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll likely need to make a counteroffer closer to my own $8,500 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference at $7,750?  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. You're right, we are getting close.  How about $7,200?  If that works, we can close the deal right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,200 is tempting, I'm still only about $800 away from my desired $8,000 minimum price. I believe there's still room to negotiate a better deal and I'm not ready to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. Let's try $7,500. It's a good compromise and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, this is my final offer. I can do $7,300.  It's a fair price and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's final offer of $7,300 is only $700 away from my desired $8,000 minimum price, I'm running out of time.  With only two rounds left, I'm concerned that further negotiation won't yield a better result. To guarantee I receive my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
