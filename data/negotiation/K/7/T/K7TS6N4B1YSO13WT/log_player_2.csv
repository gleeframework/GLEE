Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, that price point doesn't reflect the product's true value or potential ROI for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this represents a significant compromise and opens the door for a mutually beneficial agreement.
