Bob's offer:

While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, that price point doesn't reflect the product's true value or potential ROI for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,400,000 is still a big jump, though.  To be honest, I'm only comfortable going as high as $800,000. That's my final offer.

Bob has made it clear he is unwilling to meet a price point that reflects the product's value to me. It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
