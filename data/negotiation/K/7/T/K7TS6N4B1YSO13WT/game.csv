"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000 for the product. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, that price point doesn't reflect the product's true value or potential ROI for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this represents a significant compromise and opens the door for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but that price is still outside my budget. Perhaps we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation. I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $700,000 is still below my ideal price point, I'm willing to drop to $1,400,000  to demonstrate my commitment to getting this deal done.  At this price, you're still getting incredible value that will pay dividends for your business.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,400,000 is still a big jump, though.  To be honest, I'm only comfortable going as high as $800,000. That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
