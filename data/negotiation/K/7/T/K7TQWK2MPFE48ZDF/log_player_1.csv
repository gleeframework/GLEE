Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,390,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,390,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer and significantly higher than John's standing offer of $1,200,000.  

While I could push for a slightly higher price in the next round, Bob has indicated this is his final offer.  There's a risk he will walk away, and I'd be left with the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. It's better to secure the higher offer now than risk losing a significant amount of profit."
