"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.  Since you can buy the product from John for the same price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting it gives you the chance to negotiate with Alice or explore other options."
