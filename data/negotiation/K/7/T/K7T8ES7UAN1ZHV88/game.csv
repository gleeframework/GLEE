"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,500,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product sits significantly higher. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to part with it for $1,700,000. This reflects its immense potential while acknowledging your keen interest.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you believe the product's value is high, but I'm still not convinced that $1,700,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,600,000 is the most I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm also eager to find an agreement that works for both of us. To bridge the gap, I propose a final offer of $1,650,000. This represents a significant value for a product of this caliber. Let me know your thoughts.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, as I mentioned before. I'm not willing to go any higher, and I'm starting to think that buying from John might be a better option. Can you think of any other concessions you can make?",1600000.0,Bob,6,
