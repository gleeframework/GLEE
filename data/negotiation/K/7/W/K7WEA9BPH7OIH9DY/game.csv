"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I am interested in the product, the price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to pay $650,000 for it. I believe this is a fair offer considering the market value of similar products.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $750,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  Would you consider $700,000? I'm confident this would be a mutually beneficial deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going below $720,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $715,000, but that's as low as I can go.",715000.0,Alice,7,
