"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still far higher than the product's value to her ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This price represents a fair compromise and allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This price takes into account the product's value to you, but also reflects its worth to me. I'm open to further discussion, but I believe this price is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, but she's showing a willingness to negotiate.  It's worth continuing to counteroffer to try and close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still too far from what I'm able to pay. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This offer reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to stay within my budget. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This price reflects a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your target price. There's still some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  To get this deal done, I'm willing to offer $975,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a reasonable outcome. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. Considering the product's value to me and your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This price is a fair compromise that I believe we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're almost there. To get this done today, I'm going to offer $1,000,000.

Let's close this deal and both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to me and the effort we've both put into this negotiation, I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,075,000. This price reflects a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where Alice is unwilling to go below $1,075,000. This price is still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product and higher than what I'm comfortable with.  With only one round left, it's not worth risking another counteroffer that could be rejected, potentially leaving me with no deal at all.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John, even at a higher price, to ensure I get the product I need."
