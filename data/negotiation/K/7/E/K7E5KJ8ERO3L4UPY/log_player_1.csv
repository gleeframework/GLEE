"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This creates some room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for myself. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, giving me the chance to see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm going to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. There's still a chance he's willing to budge, and I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profit that's higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. It's time to secure the deal and avoid the risk of further haggling or a potential stalemate. Accepting this offer ensures a reasonable profit and avoids the uncertainty of continuing the negotiation."
