"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $250 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 is a bit steep for you, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $175. Would you be interested in taking it home for that price?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $150?  I'm serious about wanting this product, but I can't go any higher.",150.0,Bob,4,
