Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that I can always lower it if necessary. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm countering with $150, which is still a decent profit for me and is likely more appealing than Bob's $130 offer.  It's important to keep moving towards a deal while staying within my acceptable range."
