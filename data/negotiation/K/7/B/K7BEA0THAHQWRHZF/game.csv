"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my value and your need to sell.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my willingness to negotiate.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the fact that I'm ready to buy now.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your price, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
