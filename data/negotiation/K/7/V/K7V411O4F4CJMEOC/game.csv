"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $180?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to pay $140 for it. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $150? This is my final offer. ",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're being firm on $150, Bob. I appreciate that. However, I've already had another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay the minimum price of $150. I'm willing to give you a slight discount to $155 to close the deal with you, but that's as low as I can go.",155.0,Alice,5,
