"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $6,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $7,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500? I'm trying to be fair and find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
