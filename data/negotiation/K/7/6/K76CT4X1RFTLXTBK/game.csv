"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I have in mind for this product. It offers substantial value, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be upfront about the value of this product. $950,000 is still quite a way off from what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000, but that's my final offer. I believe this price reflects the product's true worth and potential.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
