Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is slowly moving towards our desired price point. We are still in a good position to negotiate. Accepting $975,000 would be leaving potential profit on the table.  We'll send another counteroffer, showing we're willing to negotiate but won't accept a price below our minimum."

Round 8

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer at this point. He's consistently been around the $900,000 mark, and while he's inching up, it's unlikely he'll reach our desired price point within the remaining rounds.  

Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of Bob not reaching a satisfactory offer within the time limit."
