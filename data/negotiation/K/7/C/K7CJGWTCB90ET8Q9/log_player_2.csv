# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product, which I know will be a valuable asset to your operations. My initial price is $1,400,000, reflecting its high quality and potential benefits. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price within these negotiations.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  I'm offering $1,250,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could make a deal at $1,150,000. This is a fair offer, and I hope we can close this out soon."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe $1,150,000 doesn't fully reflect the value you'll gain from this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000.  This price gives you a significant discount and allows me to earn a reasonable return.  Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,175,000. This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's wrap this up."", ""product_price"": 1175000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,175,000 is still a bit low for me, but to show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,190,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to conclude this deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly, and the price of $1,190,000 is a good deal considering your alternatives. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might risk the deal entirely. Accepting now secures a significant saving compared to John's offer."
