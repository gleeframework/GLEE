"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $13500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $12500 is getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can sell the product to you for $13000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",13000.0,Alice,5,
