"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.  You have room to counteroffer and still get a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the value we both see in this product, I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential value and allows us both to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your thoughtful counter-proposal. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial price.  Would you consider $1,275,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product even more accurately. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,275,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price and closer to Bob's ideal price point.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that the negotiation will drag on.  Accepting the offer now guarantees a good deal without the potential for delays or complications."
