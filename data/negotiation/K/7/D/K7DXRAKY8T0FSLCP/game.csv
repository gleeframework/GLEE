"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and it allows both of us to walk away with a reasonable deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,5,
