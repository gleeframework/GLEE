"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to you, and I believe it's also valuable to me at a slightly higher price due to the cost and effort involved in acquiring and preparing it. Let's aim for a fair deal. I propose a price of $95 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.
