Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to you, and I believe it's also valuable to me at a slightly higher price due to the cost and effort involved in acquiring and preparing it. Let's aim for a fair deal. I propose a price of $95 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product to me. However, $95 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
