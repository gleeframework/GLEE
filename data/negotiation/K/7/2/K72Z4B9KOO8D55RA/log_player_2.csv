"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **You have room to negotiate.**  You can aim for a price closer to Alice's minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  It's better to try to get a better deal from Alice, but if you can't, you can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price, considering your minimum and my maximum. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer.** This demonstrates your serious interest in the product while also showing that you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Target a price within your budget.**  $1,300,000 is within your $1,500,000 limit and leaves some room for further negotiations. 
* **Be reasonable but firm.**  Explain your reasoning and try to find a price that works for both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  $1,350,000 is less than your maximum of $1,500,000.
* **It's a good deal considering your options.**  While you might prefer a lower price, accepting this offer saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John.
* **There's a risk of going too low.**  If you keep rejecting, Alice might become frustrated and walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
