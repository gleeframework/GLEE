"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer.  He has a lot to gain by trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1100000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise between our initial offers.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than he wants to pay.  He's already made a counteroffer and there's no reason to stop now.  He can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  He can still make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.  He's already come down from $1,100,000 to $1,200,000, and a small jump to $1,250,000 could be the difference between getting a great deal and paying a bit too much."
