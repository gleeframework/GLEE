"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1100000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1100000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise between our initial offers.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
