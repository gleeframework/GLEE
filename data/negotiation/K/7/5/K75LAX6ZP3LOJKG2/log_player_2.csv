"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You're aiming for a price lower than $1,250,000, and you have 9 more rounds to try. Buying from John right now would be too expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but it's still a price that Alice might be willing to accept given her minimum selling price of $1,000,000. This will give us some negotiating room in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm aiming for.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better price. Buying from John is still not an attractive option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a price that's closer to my target. It's possible Alice will counter with a lower price or even accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and we're nearing the halfway point of our negotiations.  I'm going to continue trying to get a better price. Buying from John is still a last resort if I can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,150,000. This is a modest increase but shows Alice that I'm willing to move a little closer to her price. We're still five rounds away from having to make a decision on John's offer, so there's still time to try and get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, I'm still not willing to pay that much. We have only 3 rounds left, and there's still a chance to negotiate a lower price. I will continue to try and reach a deal with Alice, but if the next few rounds don't yield better results, I might consider buying from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

We're in the final stretch now.  I'm making a significant increase to my offer to $1,200,000. This is a major compromise on my part, but I'm hoping Alice will see this as a genuine attempt to reach a deal. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll likely have to buy from John as we only have two rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round. Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, it's still too high for me. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal with Alice altogether.  It's better to buy from John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get the product. While it's not my ideal price, it's still within my budget and allows me to secure the purchase."
