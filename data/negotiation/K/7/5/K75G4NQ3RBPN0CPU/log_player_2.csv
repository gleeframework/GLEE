You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance you can get a better deal with Alice, or at least explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying, but also sets a clear expectation that I'm looking for a much lower price.  $1,200,000 is still within my budget, and it leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I'm not willing to pay more than $1,500,000 for the product. I'll reject and try to negotiate further.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below my maximum budget. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm still serious about getting a good deal.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to come closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, even though it's closer than before.  I'm not willing to pay more than $1,500,000 for the product, and I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm also aware that I have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000 if I'm not happy with the price.  Rejecting this offer gives me more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final offer.  I'm offering Alice my maximum price, making it clear that I'm serious about buying, but I won't go any higher. If Alice accepts, we close the deal. If she rejects, I'll proceed with buying from John, as that's my fallback option.  There's no reason to keep negotiating further at this point."
