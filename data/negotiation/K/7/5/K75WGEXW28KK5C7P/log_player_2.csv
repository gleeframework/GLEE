"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always best to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you have a backup option with John, you're in a good position to try and get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still pretty close to your limit with Alice's offer.  It's worth seeing if you can get her down to $10,500 or closer.  If she won't budge, you can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get the product for $10,500.  It's the maximum I'm comfortable paying right now.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're sticking to your price, but I'm still hoping to find a compromise.  How about $10800? This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still very close to your limit with Alice's offer. It's worth seeing if you can get her down to $10,500, or even a little closer, before you commit to buying from her.  Remember, you can always buy from John for $10,000 if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
