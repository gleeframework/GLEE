,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the unique value you're offering,  $200 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be interested in purchasing if the price were closer to $150.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you. However, I still think this product is worth more than $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $175 is still a bit above my budget. I'm happy to pay $160 for this product. It's a fair price that's within my range. Let's make this deal happen!",160.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $160 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $165. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, and I think it's still a great value for you. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit hesitant at $165.  How about we settle at $162?  It's a small step closer to my limit, and hopefully, we can finalize this deal.",162.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $162 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $163. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, and I think it's still a great value for you. What do you think?",163.0,Alice,7,
