"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know it's worth more to you than that. Let's make a deal!",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. It's a great product, but I've done my research and I'm not sure it's worth that much to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of the product. Let's close this deal!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,075,000. Can you consider that?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $1,090,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll agree that it's a fair price for the value you'll get from this product. Let's make this deal happen!",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,090,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,090,000, so I'm offering $1,082,500. Can you consider that?",1082500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making progress, and I appreciate your negotiation.  However, $1,082,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,085,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price for the value you'll get from this product.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can find a good solution for both of us.",1085000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,085,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,085,000, so I'm offering $1,080,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.",1080000.0,Bob,8,
