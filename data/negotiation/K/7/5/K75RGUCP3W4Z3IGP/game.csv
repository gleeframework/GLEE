"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'd hoped for.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I understand your perspective.  Let's meet halfway â€“ would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $1,075,000. It's a fair compromise, closer to both our desired prices. What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
