# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

 It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  $1,150,000 is still above your target, and since Alice is motivated to sell, there's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I understand your perspective.  Let's meet halfway â€“ would you consider $1,100,000?

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your target. You're still within your budget, so there's no need to rush into buying from John yet. Keep negotiating with Alice to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
