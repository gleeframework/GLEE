"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest in the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, given its value to me.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. Let's try to find a way to bridge this gap.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal.  Would you consider $925,000? This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to work with you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to make this deal happen.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a good compromise and is the highest I can go at this time.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
