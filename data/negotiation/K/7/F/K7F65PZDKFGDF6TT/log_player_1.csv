Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest in the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, given its value to me.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is less than my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise at this stage.  

* **Time Value:**  We are past the halfway point in the negotiations. Continuing to haggle might not yield a significantly better outcome and risks losing Bob altogether.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Holding out for a higher price from Bob means potentially missing out on other opportunities or deals.

Accepting $900,000 now secures a good return and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
