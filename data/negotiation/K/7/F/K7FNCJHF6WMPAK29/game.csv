"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $11250. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11250 is a bit closer to what I'm looking for, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12500 and $11250, which would be $12875. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",12875.0,Alice,5,
