"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for showing me the product, Alice! I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? It's a fair offer that would allow me to get a good deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal too. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a good middle ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a good deal considering its value to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm ready to make a deal today, but $11,250 is pushing my budget.  To be completely honest, I could go with another seller for $11,000. Would you be willing to match that? If so, we have a deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to match the other seller's price of $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,100. It's a bit higher than the other seller's price, but I think it's still a good deal considering its value to you.",11100.0,Alice,7,
