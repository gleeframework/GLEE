"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to consider my offer.

This strategy aims to establish a starting point for negotiation while keeping in mind my own minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Even though Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $15,000 I can get from John.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  There are still rounds left, and I can potentially get a higher price from Bob through further negotiation.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer to keep the negotiation open and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $13,250. This still leaves us both with a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone to encourage Bob to accept.

By meeting Bob halfway and framing the offer as a win-win, I'm increasing the chances of getting a deal while staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $13250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13250, which would be $12625. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $15,000 I can get from John.
* **Multiple rounds remaining:** There are several rounds left, and I have the chance to potentially get a better offer from Bob.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer, hoping to secure a higher price through further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to find a price we both agree on. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,625 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $13,000. This price is a good compromise and closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** I'm increasing my offer by a smaller margin this time, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also trying to maintain my value. 
* **Highlighting Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing the compromise aspect of my offer, making it seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly to encourage Bob to engage further. 

My goal is to slowly inch closer to a deal while staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I'm willing to pay $12750, which is the next closest number to what I'm looking for. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below the $15,000 I can get from John.
* **Several rounds left:** We still have several rounds to negotiate, and I can potentially get a better price from Bob.
* **Risk of losing time:**  Accepting Bob's offer at this stage might not be the best strategy. I might be able to get a higher price later.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable value or potentially secure a better offer in the next rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for us. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you $12,875. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm showing flexibility by offering a price that's the midpoint between Bob's offer and my previous offer.
* **Highlighting Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is a fair compromise for both parties. 
* **Time is of the Essence:** With fewer rounds left, it's important to move closer to a deal without dropping below my minimum.

This counteroffer is intended to push us closer to a deal while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $12750, which is the price I was previously willing to pay. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is increasing.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Bob's offer is not significantly higher:** Bob's offer is only slightly above his previous offer and still below my desired price.

While I would prefer to get a higher price from Bob, the risk of further negotiation is too high at this point.  Selling to John ensures a certain profit and avoids the possibility of losing out entirely in the final rounds."
