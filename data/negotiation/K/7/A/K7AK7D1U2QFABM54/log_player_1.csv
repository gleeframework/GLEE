Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** John provides a safety net at $100 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $115, you're:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You secure a $15 profit if Bob accepts.
* **Staying Competitive:** The price is still attractive to Bob as it's less than his perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, potentially pushing the price even higher."
