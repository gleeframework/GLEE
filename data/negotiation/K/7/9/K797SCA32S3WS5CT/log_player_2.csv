Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1100000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to know if it's acceptable to you.

Alice is not budging from her price, and it is still well above Bob's budget.  Bob should buy from John for $800,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
