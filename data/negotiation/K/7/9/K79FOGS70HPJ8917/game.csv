"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the sale.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? It's a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $8,900? It's a compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's close this transaction and avoid going back and forth any further.",8900.0,Alice,5,
