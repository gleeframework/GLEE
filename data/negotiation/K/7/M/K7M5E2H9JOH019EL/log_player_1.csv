"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. I'm offering a price that's higher than what Bob thinks it's worth, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good chance of getting a price closer to my desired value while also leaving room for potential counteroffers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get a better deal.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to $10,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9800} 
```"
