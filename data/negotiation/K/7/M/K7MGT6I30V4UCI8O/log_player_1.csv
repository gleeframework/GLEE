"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,000,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a tighter budget in mind. Would you consider $600,000? This way, you still get a good deal above what most would offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
