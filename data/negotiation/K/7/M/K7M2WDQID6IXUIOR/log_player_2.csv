"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to me, but I understand its value may differ. Considering its quality and benefits, I propose a price of $120 for you. This allows us both to benefit from the transaction.

Round 2

{

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're considering my product, Bob. Let's aim for a fair compromise. How about a price of $90 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Okay, Alice, a deal at $90 sounds fair. I'll take it!"") 
```

While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, getting the product for $10 less than John's offer is a good deal. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and I risk her ending the negotiation."
