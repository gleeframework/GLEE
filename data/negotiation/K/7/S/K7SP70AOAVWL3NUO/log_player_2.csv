"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and we're confident it will meet your needs perfectly. We're offering it to you for $95 today. Don't miss out on this opportunity to get a high-quality item at a great price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good price, you are aiming to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm happy to purchase the product for $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  We know the product is worth $80 to Alice. Offering $85 is a starting point that shows you're serious about buying but also leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Messaging:** The message is polite but firm, emphasizing your desire to purchase while setting your desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your feedback, we're willing to adjust our price to $90. We believe this offers a fair compromise while still providing value for our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** Remember your goal is to save as much as possible, and you're willing to pay up to $100 for the product.
* **Negotiation:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for further negotiation. 
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John right now would cost you $100, which isn't necessary if you can get the product from Alice for less. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you continue the negotiation process with the goal of getting the product at a price closer to $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get it for $88. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** You've successfully lowered the price from Alice's initial $95 to $90.
* **Middle Ground:** Offering $88 is a good compromise, showing your willingness to meet halfway while still trying to get a better price.
* **Urgency:** Adding ""I'm ready to close the deal now"" creates a sense of urgency, which could encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. We understand your position and would like to offer the product to you for $89. This price reflects our commitment to providing quality products at competitive prices. We hope this meets your expectations and allows us to proceed with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice has come down to $89, which is only $1 more than your last counteroffer of $88. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** If you reject this offer, you risk Alice going back up in price, or potentially ending the negotiation, forcing you to buy from John for $100. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's  important to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with.

While a price of $88 would be ideal, accepting $89 represents a good outcome, achieving a significant discount from Alice's initial asking price and saving you $11 compared to buying from John."
