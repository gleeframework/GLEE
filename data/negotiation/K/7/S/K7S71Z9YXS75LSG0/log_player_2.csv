You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is enthusiastic, she's offering the product at her own valuation ($150) which is also your maximum price. There's no room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of getting a better deal. If she really wants to sell it to you, she might come back with a lower price. If not, you can always buy from John at the same price."
