"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10000, which is the maximum I'm comfortable paying. Can you consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
