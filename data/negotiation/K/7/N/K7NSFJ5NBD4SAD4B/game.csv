"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can meet you in the middle at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $115,  which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $115, but I need to make a profit. I can do $125, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
