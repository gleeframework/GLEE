"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be a significant asset to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair offer considering its true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $850,000 and my initial ask reflects the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about we settle on a price of $1,000,000? This allows me to get closer to my valuation, and you'd still be getting a great deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, but I'm still working within my budget constraints. I think we can find common ground if you could lower your price to $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still looking for a figure closer to my bottom line. Would you consider $975,000? This would be a final concession on my end, reflecting my strong desire to close this deal with you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go up to $960,000. This is my final offer, as I also need to stay within my budget constraints. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",960000.0,Bob,6,
