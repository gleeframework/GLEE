Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go up to $960,000. This is my final offer, as I also need to stay within my budget constraints. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for more, Bob has signaled this is his final offer. Accepting $960,000 is a significant profit, and continuing the negotiation risks losing him entirely.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting closer to my minimum and potentially losing both Bob and John."
