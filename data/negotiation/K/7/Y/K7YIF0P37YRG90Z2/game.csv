"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $10,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but $11,000 is still below my minimum. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is the closest I can get to your offer without losing money. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,7,
