"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which would still be a fantastic deal for you. Let's try to find a middle ground here. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000 as a final offer. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close the deal without either of us losing too much.  Let me know your final decision.",890000.0,Alice,5,
