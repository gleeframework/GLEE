"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but how about $8,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from.  While I think the product is great, $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $9,000? This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
