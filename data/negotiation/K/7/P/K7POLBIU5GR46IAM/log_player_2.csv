Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but how about $8,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $9,000? This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

It seems like Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,000. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $8,000 and secure the best possible price."
