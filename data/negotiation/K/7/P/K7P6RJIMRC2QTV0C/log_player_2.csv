"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. For this exceptional opportunity, I am proposing a price of $150. Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to you, and John is offering it at that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. You can secure the product at your maximum value by buying from John."
