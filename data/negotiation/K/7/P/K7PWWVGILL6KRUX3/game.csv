"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130. Let's see if we can work something out.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $155? That's a good compromise, and it still gives me some wiggle room.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $145 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference at $147.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",147.5,Alice,5,
