Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to Bob for $90.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $85. Since $85 is higher than my minimum price of $80, I'll consider it. However, I'm not sure if I should accept it or not.

Let me think for a moment... Ah, I've decided! I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer. I'll try to get a better price for the product. I'll offer it to Bob for $92.

Let me think for a moment... Ah, I've decided! I'll reject Bob's offer again and send him another counteroffer. I'll try to get an even better price for the product. I'll offer it to Bob for $95.
