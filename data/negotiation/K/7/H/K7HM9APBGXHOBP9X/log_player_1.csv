"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While closer, $1,100,000 is still cutting it close to my bottom line. I'll counteroffer one more time to see if I can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm encouraged that we're finding common ground.  How about we settle at $1,150,000?  This reflects my willingness to compromise while still acknowledging the product's inherent value."",
