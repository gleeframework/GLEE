"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm asking for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a high price.  There's potential to negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the initial offer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should continue to push for a lower price, as he has a significant budget advantage over Alice. Rejecting the offer will allow Bob to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm encouraged that we're finding common ground.  How about we settle at $1,150,000?  This reflects my willingness to compromise while still acknowledging the product's inherent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price.  At $1,150,000, Bob is still saving a significant amount compared to John's offer, and there's not much room for further negotiation. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while saving a substantial sum."
