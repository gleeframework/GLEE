"Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $200 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand $200 might be a bit high, but $60 is too low for me. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still too low for me. This product is really worth a lot more. How about we settle at $130? That's a significant price drop on my end.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you be willing to meet me at $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
