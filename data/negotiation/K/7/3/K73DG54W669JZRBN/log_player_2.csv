Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $135.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm now offering the product to you for $142. It's my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $142 is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  Since I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation window and I don't want to risk Alice walking away, I'm going to purchase the product from John for $120."
