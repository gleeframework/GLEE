"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $160 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to buy it for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $160 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $145. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of this amazing product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, I'm still not quite there.  How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I'm now offering the product to you for $140. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of this amazing product.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $138? It's a small step closer to your price and would allow us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",138.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm now offering the product to you for $142. It's my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",142.0,Alice,7,
