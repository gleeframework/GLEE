"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay.  Since you have 10 rounds and John is offering a better price, it makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to find a price that's closer to my desired budget, but still attractive enough for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is higher than my previous counteroffer and still above my target price. It's better than her first offer, but I'm still inclined to negotiate further.  With 7 rounds left, I have time to try and get a better price.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,275,000.  This is a smaller jump than before, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm serious about getting a good price.  I'm hoping this shows a willingness to compromise and could lead to a successful agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting higher, not lower. This suggests she's not willing to budge much. At this point, we're halfway through the rounds, and I'm not confident I can get her down to my target price.  John's offer of $1,200,000 is the best I've seen so far and is within my budget. It's time to take the sure thing and avoid risking further negotiation."
