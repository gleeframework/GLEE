Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm  prepared to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.
