"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I think it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true worth and your potential need for it, I propose a price of $120. This allows us both to find a fair compromise where you can acquire something valuable without overpaying, and I can ensure a reasonable return on my investment. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.
