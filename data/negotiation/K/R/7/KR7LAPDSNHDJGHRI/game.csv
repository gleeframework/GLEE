"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $950,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,075,000 is still a little outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,025,000. This would be a significant investment for me, but it's the absolute most I can offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $1,075,000 again, but this time I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $50,000. This way, you'll be getting an even better value for your investment. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
