"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for you. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about $925,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's try to close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to think about the costs and risks involved. Let me see if I can do a bit better. How about $935,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal here.",935000.0,Alice,5,
