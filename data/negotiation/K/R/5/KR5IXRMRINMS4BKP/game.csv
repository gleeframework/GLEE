"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both parties.  Let me know your thoughts.",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your confidence. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,700,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of your product while staying within my financial limits.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately not viable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit while recognizing the value your company finds in this product. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline $1,550,000. I am still working within a strict budget and cannot exceed $1,300,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects the value of your product while staying within my financial constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal. ",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort in coming down to $1,450,000. However, I am still unable to meet that price due to my budget constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my financial limits. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
