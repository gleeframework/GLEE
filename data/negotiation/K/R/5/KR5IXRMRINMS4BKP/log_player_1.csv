Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both parties.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your confidence. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,700,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of your product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired value, it's still significantly lower than what I want.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately not viable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit while recognizing the value your company finds in this product. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline $1,550,000. I am still working within a strict budget and cannot exceed $1,300,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects the value of your product while staying within my financial constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired value, it's still lower than what I'd like to achieve. I believe I can still get a better price with further negotiation. Selling to John at this point would guarantee my minimum value, but I'm not yet ready to give up on getting closer to my desired price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort in coming down to $1,450,000. However, I am still unable to meet that price due to my budget constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my financial limits. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is very close to my minimum desired value of $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,500,000, we're already at round 6 and I risk losing the deal entirely if I continue to counter-offer.  It's likely that Bob will not budge further, and I risk reaching the 10 round limit without a deal.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and a price that's within a reasonable range of my minimum desired value."
