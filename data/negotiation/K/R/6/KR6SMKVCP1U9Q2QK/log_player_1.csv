Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think it's a great deal and you'll find it very useful."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, your goal is to get as close to that as possible with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While you want close to $150, starting at that price leaves no room for Bob to counter-offer.  A slightly lower price might make him feel like he's getting a deal. 
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:**  If you start too high (e.g., $180), Bob might think you're desperate and unwilling to negotiate. 

By offering the product at $149, you're aiming for the highest price Bob is likely to accept while still leaving yourself open to a potential counter-offer that could land you even closer to your $150 goal."
