"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is too high. Bob should reject the offer and make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $1,100,000 is lower than the previous offer, it's still above his budget. It's better to continue negotiating and see if he can get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This price is fair given the value I place on the product and your need to sell. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers, which is $987,500. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

Alice is still asking for more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's time for Bob to move on and buy the product from John for $800,000.  This is a good deal for Bob and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
