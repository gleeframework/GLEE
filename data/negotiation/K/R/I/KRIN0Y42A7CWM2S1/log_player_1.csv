Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob an incentive to counteroffer, which allows for a possible win-win scenario.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm aware that I can sell the product to John for $120, so I'm not going to accept any offer lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you be open to selling the product for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $90 is better than $80 (what it's worth to Bob), it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity to counter:** I can still try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **Keeping John as a backup:**  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $105? It's still a great deal for you and closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even at $105, as it's significantly less than what he'd pay elsewhere.
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm still above my minimum price of $120, leaving room for potential further negotiation.
* **Maintaining a friendly tone:** I'm keeping the conversation polite and open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'll try to meet you halfway. How about $95 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity to counter again:** I can still try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.
* **Keeping John as a safety net:** It's essential to remember that I can always sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $95, but I'm still not quite there. How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but fair:** I'm holding my ground at $100, but I'm reiterating that it's a fair price for both of us. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still value the product.
* **Highlighting the benefit:**  I'm reminding Bob that $100 is still significantly less than what he'd pay elsewhere, emphasizing the value of the deal for him.
* **Avoiding further downward negotiation:**  If I accept $95, I'm risking a downward spiral in the price.  By holding at $100, I'm signaling that this is my final offer.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm ready to sell to John for $120."
