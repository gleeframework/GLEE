Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $7,500 as a starting point.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and closer to my desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

While $8,500 is closer to my target, I'm still willing to negotiate further.  There's still room for a better deal."
