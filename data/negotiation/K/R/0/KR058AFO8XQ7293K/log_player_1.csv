Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $160. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my initial asking price. I hope this will be a good compromise and encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at $155, which is above my minimum of $150. Since I can sell to John for $150, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer. This ensures I get a better price than selling to John, and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
