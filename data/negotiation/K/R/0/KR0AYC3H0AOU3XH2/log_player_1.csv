Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  The price is not too close to my minimum, so I have some wiggle room to accept counteroffers.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to build rapport and a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that high right now.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price point and below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can make a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, I'm willing to take a slight risk in hopes of achieving a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still represents a good value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  I'm not dropping the price too drastically, signaling that I still value the product highly and am not desperate for a sale.
* **Positive and Motivational Message:**  I emphasize the value for Bob and the potential for a successful deal, encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise and a significant improvement over his initial offer. It's closer to my desired price than selling to John.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly better price, but it also risks dragging out the process and increasing the chance of Bob walking away entirely.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of not reaching a deal with him and having to settle for John's offer.

While I'd prefer a higher price, $900,000 is a reasonable outcome considering the dynamics of the negotiation."
