"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $12,000 to me.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $11,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,200? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $10,200 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000.  How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. How about we meet at $10,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Alice,5,
