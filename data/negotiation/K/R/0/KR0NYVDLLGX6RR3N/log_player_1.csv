"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'll be watching closely to see if he's interested at this price, and I'll adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to sell,  $10,000 is significantly less than my minimum value. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm countering with $17,500. This is a compromise, as I'm willing to go down from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a profit. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough to Bob, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough to make this sale worthwhile.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round.  I'm also starting to consider if I might be better off selling to John, as we're getting close to the halfway point of the negotiation, and it might be more profitable to accept the $15,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $16,000. This is getting closer to John's offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little more from Bob.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but with only 4 rounds left, I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not high enough to make me comfortable.  I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher in the next few rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure $15,000."
